	abstract = {The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

	abstract = {The conservation status and factors threatening fishes worldwide are reviewed in order to introduce a series of one-page articles on 'Threatened fishes of the world', and to encourage the incorporation of information on threatened fishes into international conservation programmes. Information on fish extinction and threat rates are compared with those of other animal groups, and the unique characteristics of fish conservation problems are highlighted. At present 979 species of fishes are listed as threatened in the IUCN Red List and at least 36 species and three subspecies are listed as recently extinct. It is argued that these figures are probably gross underestimates and that they may mislead conservation authorities and resource users about the seriousness of the situation. Freshwater fishes may be the most threatened group of vertebrates after the Amphibia. `Urgent action is required to save many narrowly endemic, stenotopic species from extinction, especially in Africa, Asia and South America. The conservation of common species that drive essential ecological processes is also important. Anthropogenic pressures, especially habitat degradation, the introduction of invasive species and pollution, on inland and coastal waters are particularly severe and many major fish communities are threatened with elimination throughout the world. The conservation of marine fishes is complicated by the fact that it is difficult to ascertain their rarity. The importance of the retention of genetic variation is highlighted, and both orthodox and innovative conservation measures are encouraged. Further research on minimum viable populations, genetics, and the factors that cause fishes to become vulnerable to extinction, is urgently required.},

Although there is a long history of study of regional diversity as an emergent property, analyses of fully multiscale dynamics are rare. Here, we use scale transition theory for a quantitative analysis of multiscale diversity maintenance with continuous scales of dispersal and environmental variation in space and time. We develop our analysis with a model of a linear habitat, applicable to streams or coastlines, to provide a theoretical foundation for the long-standing interest in environmental variation and dispersal, including downstream drift. We find that the strength of regional coexistence is strongest when local densities and local environmental conditions are strongly correlated. Increasing dispersal and shortening environmental correlations weaken the strength of coexistence regionally and shift the dominant coexistence mechanism from fitness-density covariance to the spatial storage effect, while increasing local diversity. Analysis of the physical and biological determinants of these mechanisms improves understanding of traditional concepts of environmental filters, mass effects, and species sorting. Our results highlight the limitations of the binary distinction between local communities and a species pool and emphasize species coexistence as a problem of multiple scales in space and time.},

At the larger ﬁeld scale, abundance-based dissimilarities among communities decreased over time, indicating convergence of dominant species, whereas incidence-based dissimilarities showed little temporal tend, indicating no sign of convergence. In contrast, plots within each ﬁeld diverged in both species composition and abundance. Abundance-based successional rates decreased over time, whereas rare species and herbaceous plants showed little change in temporal turnover rates. Initial abandonment conditions only inﬂuenced community structure early in succession. Overall, our ﬁndings provide strong evidence for scale and abundance dependence of stochastic and deterministic processes over old-ﬁeld succession.},

In most existing ecological theories and models in biodiversity research, movement is represented simplistically, ignoring the behavioural basis of movement and consequently the variation in behaviour at species and individual levels. However, as human endeavours modify climate and land use, the behavioural processes of organisms in response to these changes, including movement, become critical to understanding the resulting biodiversity loss. Here, we draw together research from different subdisciplines in ecology to understand the impact of individual-level movement processes on community-level patterns in species composition and coexistence. We join the movement ecology framework with the key concepts from metacommunity theory, community assembly and modern coexistence theory using the idea of micro–macro links, where various aspects of emergent movement behaviour scale up to local and regional patterns in species mobility and mobile-link-generated patterns in abiotic and biotic environmental conditions. These in turn influence both individual movement and, at ecological timescales, mechanisms such as dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, and niche partitioning. We conclude by highlighting challenges to and promising future avenues for data generation, data analysis and complementary modelling approaches and provide a brief outlook on how a new behaviour-based view on movement becomes important in understanding the responses of communities under ongoing environmental change.},

Our analysis suggests that the disagreements are based on selective use of relatively few food webs, as well as analytical decisions that obscure important variability in the data. We analyze a broad range of 16 high-quality food webs, with 25–172 nodes, from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Food webs generally have much higher complexity, measured as connectance (the fraction of all possible links that are realized in a network), and much smaller size than other networks studied, which have important implications for network topology. Our results resolve prior conflicts by demonstrating that although some food webs have small-world and scale-free structure, most do not if they exceed a relatively low level of connectance. Although food-web degree distributions do not display a universal functional form, observed distributions are systematically related to network connectance and size. Also, although food webs often lack small-world structure because of low clustering, we identify a continuum of real-world networks including food webs whose ratios of observed to random clustering coefficients increase as a power–law function of network size over 7 orders of magnitude. Although food webs are generally not small-world, scale-free networks, food-web topology is consistent with patterns found within those classes of networks.},

Field observations revealed that green-leaved plants were dominant in green habitats, and red-leaved individuals were dominant in urban habitats, at local ({\textless}500 meters), landscape ({\textless}50 kilometers), and global scales. Growth and photosynthesis experiments demonstrated that red-leaved individuals performed better under heat stress, while green-leaved individuals performed better under nonstressful conditions. Genome-wide SNP analysis suggests that the red leaf may have evolved multiple times from the ancestral green leaf.

	abstract = {Community ecology is traditionally species-based and assumes that species comprise identical individuals. However, intraspecific variation is ubiquitous in nature because of ontogenetic growth and critical in food-we dynamics. To understand individual interaction-mediated food webs, researchers have recently focused on body size as the most fundamental biological aspect and assessed a parameter called the predator–prey mass ratio (PPMR). Herein, I review the conceptual development of the PPMR and suggest four major concerns regarding its measurement: (1) PPMR should be measured at the individual level because species-averaged values distort actual feeding relationships, (2) individual-level PPMR data on gape-unconstrained predators (e.g., terrestrial carnivores) are limited because previous studies have targeted gape-limited fish predators, (3) predators’ prey size selectivity (preferred PPRM) is conceptually different from dietary prey size (realized PPMR) and should be distinguished by incorporating environmental prey abundance information, and (4) determinants of preferred PPMR, rather than those of realized PPMR, should be identified to describe size-dependent predation. Future studies are encouraged to explore not only predation but also other interaction types (e.g., competition, mutualism, and herbivory) at the individual level. However, this is not likely to occur while ecological communities are still considered to be interspecific interaction networks. To resolve this situation and more comprehensively understand biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, I suggest that community ecology requires a paradigm shift in the unit of interaction from species to individuals, similar to evolutionary biology, which revolutionized the unit of selection, because interactions occur between individuals.},

	abstract = {Stochasticity is a major cause of compositional β-diversity in communities that develop under similar environmental conditions. Such communities may exhibit functional similarity due to sympatric taxa with equivalent metabolic capacities in the source assemblage. However, the redundancy of individual physiological traits may differ in the original source community, which in turn might lead to more or less pronounced variability of single functions among newly formed communities. We analyzed the degree of stochasticity during the primary assembly of bacterial communities originating from the same source and growing under identical conditions. We tested the links between community composition and functioning in parallel microcosms containing glucose and its dimer cellobiose. Bacteria from prefiltered lake water were diluted in artificial lake water and grown to the stationary phase. The resulting assemblages exhibited high compositional variability of taxa that were rare in the source communities. Simulations showed that the observed richness and incidence-based β-diversity could be reproduced by dispersal limitation, or by low dispersal rates associated with the ecological drift of the colonizers. Further null model analysis supported an important influence of stochasticity, as well as a synergy between dispersal limitation and both, heterogeneous and homogeneous selection. The communities functionally differed and the magnitude of functional variability depended on the substrate: more communities consumed glucose than cellobiose. However, there was no relationship between community structure and growth kinetics or substrate consumption. Thus, both structural and functional variability may be a consequence of stochastic processes during initial colonization in closed microbial communities.},

In this study, we evaluated potential mechanisms underlying the coexistence of ecologically similar bird species in a biodiversity-rich transboundary montane forest in east-central Africa by computing niche overlap indices along an environmental elevation gradient, diet, forest strata, activity patterns and within-habitat segregation across horizontal space. We found strong support for abiotic environmental habitat niche partitioning, with 55\% of species pairs having separate elevation niches. For the remaining species pairs that exhibited similar elevation niches, we found that within-habitat segregation across horizontal space and to a lesser extent vertical forest strata provided the most likely mechanisms of species coexistence. Coexistence of ecologically similar species within a highly diverse montane forest was determined primarily by abiotic factors (e.g. environmental elevation gradient) that characterize the Grinnellian niche and secondarily by biotic factors (e.g. vertical and horizontal segregation within habitats) that describe the Eltonian niche. Thus, partitioning across multiple levels of spatial organization is a key mechanism of coexistence in diverse communities.},

Early mechanism-based theory asserted that food webs have little omnivory and several properties that are independent of species richness1,2,3,4,6.

These properties include the fractions of species at top, intermediate and basal trophic levels, the means and variabilities of generality, vulnerability and food-chain length, and the degrees of cannibalism, omnivory, looping and trophic similarity.

Previous studies have shown that dispersal can stabilize local populations; however, as dispersal also tends to increase spatial synchrony, its net effect on metapopulation stability has been controversial. Here we present a simple metapopulation model to study how dispersal, in interaction with other spatial and local processes, affects the temporal variability of metapopulations in a stochastic environment. Our results show that in homogeneous metapopulations, the local stabilizing and spatial synchronizing effects of dispersal cancel each other out, such that dispersal has no effect on metapopulation variability. This result is robust to moderate heterogeneities in local and spatial parameters. When local and spatial dynamics exhibit high heterogeneities, however, dispersal can either stabilize or destabilize metapopulation dynamics through various mechanisms. Our findings have important theoretical and practical implications. We show that dispersal functions as a form of spatial intraspecific mutualism in metapopulation dynamics and that its effect on metapopulation stability is opposite to that of interspecific competition on local community stability. Our results also suggest that conservation corridors should be designed with appreciation of spatial heterogeneities in population dynamics in order to maximize metapopulation stability.},

	abstract = {Dendritic landscapes can have ecological properties that differ importantly from simpler spatial arrangements of habitats. Most dendritic landscapes are structured by elevation, and therefore, migration is likely to be directionally biased. While the population‐genetic consequences of both dendritic landscape arrangements and asymmetric migration have begun to be studied, these processes have not been considered together. Simple conceptual models predict that if migration into branch (headwater) populations is limited, such populations can act as reservoirs for potentially unique alleles. As a consequence of the fact that dendritic landscapes have, by definition, more branches than internal habitat patches, this process may lead to the maintenance of higher overall genetic diversities in metapopulations inhabiting dendritic networks where migration is directionally biased. Here we begin to address the generality of these simple predictions using genetic models and a review of empirical literature. We show, for a range of demographic parameters, that dendritic systems with asymmetric migration can maintain levels of genetic variation that are very different, sometimes very elevated, compared with more classical models of geographical population structure. Furthermore, predicted patterns of genetic variation within metapopulations—that is, stepwise increases in genetic diversity at nodes—do occur in some empirical data.},

We show that trophic coherence—a hitherto ignored feature of food webs that current structural models fail to reproduce—is a better statistical predictor of linear stability than size or complexity. Furthermore, we prove that a maximally coherent network with constant interaction strengths will always be linearly stable. We also propose a simple model that, by correctly capturing the trophic coherence of food webs, accurately reproduces their stability and other basic structural features. Most remarkably, our model shows that stability can increase with size and complexity. This suggests a key to May’s paradox, and a range of opportunities and concerns for biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {There are three hypothesized controls on food-chain length (FCL): energy supply (or “resource availability”), ecosystem size and disturbance (or “environmental variation”). In this article, the evidence for controls on FCL in freshwater ecosystems is evaluated. First, the various ways FCL can be measured are defined. Food-chain length typically is estimated as (1) connectance-based FCL—an average connectance between basal resources and top consumers, (2) functional FCL—by experimental determination of functionally significant effects of a top predator on lower trophic-level biomass patterns, and (3) realized FCL—an average connectance measure weighted by energy flow between basal consumers and the consumer occupying the maximum trophic position in the food web. Second, all evidence for relationships between the three hypothetical controls and FCL in freshwater ecosystems are evaluated. The review includes studies from streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands, phytotelmata, and experimental containers. Surprisingly, few studies of FCL in freshwaters that test the same suite of controls using the same methods are found. Equally compelling results arise from case studies based on functional, realized, and connectance-based measures of FCL. Third, 10 rules of thumb that could increase similarity of future studies, thereby facilitating synthesis across systems, are suggested. Fourth, it is discussed how FCL influences the concentration of contaminants in large-bodied animals (many of which are consumed by humans) as well as the efficacy of biocontrol applications in agriculture. Finally, there is a discussion of the potential relationships between global climate change, hydrology, and FCL in freshwaters.},

	volume = {78},
	doi = {doi:10.1890/06-1340.1},
	abstract = {Environmental variation plays a central role in regulating processes at all levels of ecological organization. Environmental data (e.g., temperature, rainfall, stream discharge, water chemistry) are typically easy to collect in large quantity, a requirement for many data-hungry time series tools. Unfortunately, these data are very rarely used effectively in ecology. Here we address this problem by outlining a suite of tools that can be used to quantify periodic, stochastic, and catastrophic variation in environmental conditions. We illustrate the application of these tools using long-term records of average daily discharge in 105 streams and rivers maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey on the NWIS (National Water Information System) web site. Specifically, we apply Fourier analysis to estimate the periodic (seasonal) and stochastic (interannual) components of variation in discharge. We then estimate the temporal autocorrelation structure of stochastic variation (i.e., noise color) in daily flows for each stream. Noise color corresponds to storage of atmospheric inputs within the watershed. Finally, we extend Fourier analysis in two ways to provide estimates of annual noise color and catastrophic variation in both high- and low-flow events. Our analysis provides three compelling insights about the nature of variation in discharge experienced by stream biota. First, seasonal variation in discharge is higher than interannual variation in most streams, although some streams can be classified as aseasonal. Second, daily noise color varies from slightly pink to black, reflecting storage of water at a wide range of temporal scales. By contrast, annual noise color is nearly uniformly white across our sample of streams, reflecting nearly zero storage of atmospheric inputs across years. Third, catastrophic variation in high flows is of greater magnitude than in low flows for many of our 105 streams, yet low-flow variation is surprisingly high. This result suggests that low-flow events may be underappreciated in stream ecology. We close by suggesting how these methods could be applied to other environmental variables (hourly temperature, monthly rainfall). Periodic, stochastic, and catastrophic sources of variation contribute to environmental stress, process noise, and disturbance, respectively. Thus, the tools we present here provide a means for estimating numerical values associated with these ecological concepts and facilitate comparative studies conducted across gradients of one or more of these sources of variation.},

Where groundwater levels lie below nearby streams, streamwater can infiltrate through the streambed, reducing streamflow and recharging the aquifer3. These ‘losing’ streams have important implications for water availability, riparian ecosystems and environmental flows4–10, but the prevalence of losing streams remains poorly constrained by continent-wide in situ observations. Here we analyse water levels in 4.2 million wells across the contiguous USA and show that nearly two-thirds (64 per cent) of them lie below nearby stream surfaces, implying that these streamwaters will seep into the subsurface if it is sufficiently permeable. A lack of adequate permeability data prevents us from quantifying the magnitudes of these subsurface flows, but our analysis nonetheless demonstrates widespread potential for streamwater losses into underlying aquifers. These potentially losing rivers are more common in drier climates, flatter landscapes and regions with extensive groundwater pumping. Our results thus imply that climatic factors, geological conditions and historic groundwater pumping jointly contribute to the widespread risk of streams losing flow into surrounding aquifers instead of gaining flow from them. Recent modelling studies10 have suggested that losing streams could become common in future decades, but our direct observations show that many rivers across the USA are already potentially losing flow, highlighting the importance of coordinating groundwater and surface water policy.},

It uses invasion growth rates—the average, per-capita growth rate of a rare species—to identify when and why species coexist. Despite significant advances in dissecting coexistence mechanisms when coexistence occurs, MCT relies on a ‘mutual invasibility’ condition designed for two-species communities but poorly defined for species-rich communities. Here, we review well-known issues with this component of MCT and propose a solution based on recent mathematical advances. We propose a clear framework for expanding MCT to species-rich communities and for understanding invasion resistance as well as coexistence, especially for communities that could not be analysed with MCT so far. Using two data-driven community models from the literature, we illustrate the utility of our framework and highlight the opportunities for bridging the fields of community assembly and species coexistence.},

Yet the degree of synchrony in a resident community may influence its resistance and resilience to the introduction of an invasive species. Here we used a generalizable mathematical framework, constructed with a modified Lotka–Volterra competition model, to first simulate resident communities across a range of competitive strengths and species' responses to environmental fluctuations, which yielded communities that ranged from strongly synchronous to compensatory. We then invaded these communities at different timesteps with invaders of varying demographic traits, after which we quantified the resident community's susceptibility to initial invasion attempts (resistance) and the degree to which community synchrony was altered after invasion (resiliency of synchrony). We found that synchronous communities were not only more resistant but also more resilient to invasion than compensatory communities, likely due to stronger competition between resident species and thus lower cumulative abundances in compensatory communities, providing greater opportunities for invasion. The growth rate of the invader was most influenced by the resident and invader competition coefficients and the growth rate of the invader species. Our findings support prioritizing the conservation of compensatory and weakly synchronous communities which may be at increased risk of invasion.},

We found that fungal pathogen exclusion reduced community temporal stability mainly through decreasing species asynchrony, while fertilization tended to reduce community temporal stability by decreasing species stability. However, there was no interaction between pathogen exclusion and nutrient fertilization. These effects were largely due to the direct effects of the treatments on plant biomass and not due to indirect effects mediated through plant diversity.

	abstract = {Temporally variable and reciprocal subsidies between ecosystems are ubiquitous. These spatial flows can generate a suite of direct and indirect effects in local and meta-ecosystems. The focus of most subsidy research, however, has been on the response of consumers in recipient ecosystems to constant subsidies over very short or very long time scales. We derive a meta-ecosystem model to explicitly consider the dynamic feedbacks between local ecosystems coupled through reciprocal pulsed subsidies. We predict oscillating reinforcing and dampening effects of reciprocal pulsed herbivore flows. Maximum reinforcing effects between reciprocal pulsed herbivore flows occur when these flows are in phase with the dynamics of neighboring predators. This prediction is robust to a range of pulse quantities and frequencies. Reciprocal pulsed herbivore subsidies lead to spatial and temporal variability in the strength of trophic cascades in local and meta-ecosystems but these cascading effects are the strongest when reciprocal pulsed subsidies are temporally concentrated. When predators demonstrate a behavioral response to prey abundance, reciprocal pulsed subsidies dampen the strength of local trophic cascades but lead to strong trophic cascades across local ecosystems. The timing of reciprocal pulsed subsidies is a critical component that determines the cascading effects of spatial flows. We show that spatial and temporal variabilities in resources and consumers can have a significant influence on the strength of cascading trophic interactions; therefore, our ability to detect and understand trophic cascades may depend on the scale of inquiry of ecological studies.},

Prey subsidies, by movement of either prey or predators, usually enhance predator abundance beyond what local resources can support.

Effects on community dynamics vary with the relative amount of input, the trophic roles of the mobile and recipient entities, and the local food web structure.

Initial compositional variation caused plant communities to remain divergent in species identities, even though these same communities converged strongly in species traits. This contrast between species divergence and trait convergence could not be explained by dispersal limitation or community neutrality alone.

	abstract = {Individuals in a population vary in their growth due to hidden and observed factors such as age, genetics, environment, disease, and carryover effects from past environments. Because size affects fitness, growth trajectories scale up to affect population dynamics. However, it can be difficult to estimate growth in data from wild populations with missing observations and observation error. Previous work has shown that linear mixed models (LMMs) underestimate hidden individual heterogeneity when more than 25\% of repeated measures are missing. Here we demonstrate a flexible and robust way to model growth trajectories. We show that state-space models (SSMs), fit using R package growmod, are far less biased than LMMs when fit to simulated data sets with missing repeated measures and observation error. This method is much faster than Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, allowing more models to be tested in a shorter time. For the scenarios we simulated, SSMs gave estimates with little bias when up to 87.5\% of repeated measures were missing. We use this method to quantify growth of Soay sheep, using data from a long-term mark-recapture study, and demonstrate that growth decreased with age, population density, weather conditions, and when individuals are reproductive. The method improves our ability to quantify how growth varies among individuals in response to their attributes and the environments they experience, with particular relevance for wild populations.},

However, when results are aggregated across existing empirical studies from aquatic ecosystems, we observe mixed FCL responses to these drivers. To understand this variability, we develop a unified competition-colonisation framework for complex food webs incorporating all of these drivers. With competition-colonisation tradeoffs among basal species, our model predicts that increasing ecosystem size generally results in a monotonic increase in FCL, while FCL displays non-linear, oscillatory responses to resource productivity or disturbance in large ecosystems featuring little disturbance or high productivity. Interestingly, such complex responses mirror patterns in empirical data. Therefore, this study offers a novel mechanistic explanation for observed variations in aquatic FCL driven by multiple environmental factors.},

The Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) is a procedure for generating time-evolution trajectories of finite populations in continuous time and has become the standard algorithm for these types of stochastic models. This article presents a simple-to-use and flexible framework for implementing the SSA using the high-level statistical computing language R and the package GillespieSSA. Using three ecological models as examples (logistic growth, Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model, and Kermack-McKendrick SIRS metapopulation model), this paper shows how a deterministic model can be formulated as a finite-population stochastic model within the framework of SSA theory and how it can be implemented in R. Simulations of the stochastic models are performed using four different SSA Monte Carlo methods: one exact method (Gillespie's direct method); and three approximate methods (explicit, binomial, and optimized tau-leap methods). Comparison of simulation results confirms that while the time-evolution trajectories obtained from the different SSA methods are indistinguishable, the approximate methods are up to four orders of magnitude faster than the exact methods.},

Body size, an integrative trait that determines demographic rates and ecosystem functions, is thought to be shrinking in the Anthropocene. Here, we assessed the prevalence of body size change in six taxon groups across 5025 assemblage time series spanning 1960 to 2020. Using the Price equation to partition this change into within-species body size versus compositional changes, we detected prevailing decreases in body size through time driven primarily by fish, with more variable patterns in other taxa. We found that change in assemblage composition contributes more to body size changes than within-species trends, but both components show substantial variation in magnitude and direction. The biomass of assemblages remains quite stable as decreases in body size trade off with increases in abundance.},

Comparing assemblages in this dataspace is difficult because the data is often sparse relative to its dimensionality and the complex structure of the manifold introduces bias and error in measurements of distance. Here, we apply diffusion maps, a manifold learning method, to find and characterize manifolds in high-dimensional compositional data. We show that diffusion maps embed the data in reduced dimensions in which the Euclidean distance between data points approximates the distance between them along the manifold. This is especially useful when species turnover is high, as it provides a way to measure meaningful distances between assemblages even when they harbor disjoint sets of species. We anticipate diffusion maps will therefore be particularly useful for characterizing community change over large spatial and temporal scales.},

Various approaches to modeling have been developed to enable us to understand spatial patterns ranging from plant distributions to plankton aggregation. We present a new approach to modeling spatial interactions by deriving approximations for the time evolution of the moments (mean and spatial covariance) of ensembles of distributions of organisms; the analysis is made possible by “moment closure,” neglecting higher-order spatial structure in the population. We use the growth and competition of plants in an explicitly spatial environment as a starting point for exploring the properties of second-order moment equations and comparing them to realizations of spatial stochastic models. We find that for a wide range of effective neighborhood sizes (each plant interacting with several to dozens of neighbors), the mean-covariance model provides a useful and analytically tractable approximation to the stochastic spatial model, and combines useful features of stochastic models and traditional reaction-diffusion-like models.},

	abstract = {Decline in species richness as well as changes in community evenness or functional diversity have been hypothesised to jointly affect ecosystem functioning. However, disentangling the relative effects of these changes in community structure is hard as these different aspects often covary with species richness in real-world ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the individual and interactive effects of functional diversity and community evenness of predators on the level of control of herbivorous prey. Using a highly replicated mesocosm experiment, we crossed three levels of functional diversity of arthropod predators with two levels of community evenness while controlling for the effect of species richness. Using this experimental setting, we hypothesised that the effect size of functional diversity of predators depends on community evenness. We expected a positive effect of functional diversity of predators on top-down control at high level of community evenness while we thought that species identity and their associated traits should drive most of the effect on top-down control at low level of community evenness. Our results did not provide any evidence for an interaction between functional diversity and community evenness nor any beneficial effect of increased functional diversity overall on predation rates of herbivorous prey. In addition, our results revealed that species and functional identity drives most of the effects of predator community composition on top-down control of their prey in our study system. Assemblages composed of active hunters with low handling time and no starvation ability tended to have the highest impacts on prey biomass. By indicating that top-down control of herbivorous prey by arthropod predators is mainly driven by species and functional identity and not by functional diversity, our study provides insights into the consequences of ongoing species loss on ecosystem functioning. Future research should now explore the predictability of trophic interactions based on functional traits of predator and herbivorous prey to anticipate the consequences of changes in species composition on ecosystem functioning.

	abstract = {Ecological interactions can promote phenotypic diversification in sympatric species. While competition can enhance trait divergence, other ecological interactions may promote convergence in sympatric species. Within butterflies, evolutionary convergences in wing color patterns have been reported between distantly related species, especially in females of palatable species, where mimetic color patterns are promoted by predator communities shared with defended species living in sympatry. Wing color patterns are also often involved in species recognition in butterflies, and divergence in this trait has been reported in closely related species living in sympatry as a result of reproductive character displacement. Here, we investigate the effect of sympatry between species on the convergence vs. divergence of their wing color patterns in relation to phylogenetic distance, focusing on the iconic swallowtail butterflies (family Papilionidae). We developed an unsupervised machine learning–based method to estimate phenotypic distances among wing color patterns of 337 species, enabling us to finely quantify morphological diversity at the global scale among species and allowing us to compute pairwise phenotypic distances between sympatric and allopatric species pairs. We found phenotypic convergence in sympatry, stronger among distantly related species, while divergence was weaker and restricted to closely related males. The convergence was stronger among females than males, suggesting that differential selective pressures acting on the two sexes drove sexual dimorphism. Our results highlight the significant effect of ecological interactions driven by predation pressures on trait diversification in Papilionidae and provide evidence for the interaction between phylogenetic proximity and ecological interactions in sympatry, acting on macroevolutionary patterns of phenotypic diversification.},

	abstract = {Incorporating intraspecific variation into species responses can improve our understanding of the effects of climate change. However, most studies overlook such variation or model intraspecific groups independently, leading to widely varying estimates at the species level. In this study, we used a generalized additive framework to model the climate responses of 25 bird species in the tropical Andes, allowing for the estimation of nonlinear responses between subspecies. We measured the effects of environmental covariates (climate, topography, and primary productivity) on relative abundances and projected population trends for near-future (2050) scenarios. Compared with models that ignored subspecies, the subspecies-level models performed better in terms of accuracy, discrimination, and goodness-of-fit, while projecting fewer species to decline in relative abundance. Thus, species could be more resilient than estimated using species-level models that ignore intraspecific variation. Nevertheless, our modeling approach also revealed that intraspecific groups may be vulnerable to future threats. We found that subspecies can have low relative abundances and small population sizes. Additionally, based on a preliminary IUCN Red List assessment, one in four subspecies could be threatened due to a small geographical range or a declining population trend. Most of these subspecies at risk inhabit centers of endemism in the northern Andes, such as the Santa Marta Mountains and the Serranía de Perijá. We suggest that protecting subspecies and other intraspecific groups (e.g. populations) could be a critical conservation strategy to buffer against the impacts of climate change, especially in biologically diverse regions.},

	abstract = {Freshwater fish are a vital resource for local communities across the rural tropics. In Southeast Asia, biodiversity-rich forests are being logged and converted to extensive oil palm monocultures. This clearly has impacts on associated freshwater ecosystems, but the impact on their biodiversity remains largely understudied and poorly understood, despite the important provisioning service that freshwater fishes provide for human well-being. This study quantifies the biomass stocks of freshwater fish across a land-use gradient encompassing primary forest, twice-logged forest, and oil palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysia, in an area where local communities are known to harvest freshwater fish. Stream fish were sampled using a cast net, the dominant technique used by local fishermen, in 200-m-long transects in 16 streams over three sampling years (2011, 2013, and 2015). Unexpectedly, no impact from land use on total fish availability was detected. There were no significant differences in fish species richness or, most importantly, biomass per unit fishing effort across the land-use gradient. There was variation in the responses of five known food species (Tor tambra, Hampala sabana, Barbodes sealei, Barbonymus balleroides, and Gastromyzon lepidogaster), and these small differences are attributed to variation in species habitat selection that co-vary with land-use change. Despite evidence to suggest that freshwater fish communities are resilient to land-use change, they still face risks associated with disturbance, such as invasion by alien species; furthermore, several of the more stenotopic species were only present in primary forest catchments. Nonetheless, freshwater fish in small headwater streams appear to represent a sustainable food resource for villages established in human-modified forests or in developed oil palm plantations.},

Of these factors, food web efficiency has been among the most difficult to quantify empirically. Thus, both the drivers and consequences of variation in food web efficiency remain largely unstudied in field settings. We estimated food web efficiency in nine desert streams spanning gradients of flash flood recurrence, resource availability, and trophic structure. Food web efficiency was estimated as fish community production relative to gross primary production at an annual timescale, based on quarterly observations of fish biomass and stream metabolism. Gross primary production was greatest in streams characterized by flashier flow regimes and greater relative light, temperature, and nitrogen availability. Fish production ranged from 0.02 to 0.50 g C m−2 yr−1, food web efficiency ranged from 9.5 × 10−5 to 1.8 × 10−2, and both properties decreased with flashier flow regime, light, temperature, and nitrogen availability, but were not associated with food chain length. These results, combined with opposite effects of environmental variation on primary vs. fish production, indicated that the effects of disturbance regime (i.e., scouring floods), light, and temperature on fish production were not strongly mediated by bottom-up controls. Estimates of food web efficiency under ambient disturbance and resource regimes suggest that a decoupling of energy flow from primary producers to upper trophic levels may prevail in hydrologically dynamic desert stream ecosystems.},

This concept is closely associated with fractals, and river networks serve as prime examples of fractal systems. Quantifying river network complexity is crucial for unveiling the role of river fractals in riverine ecological dynamics, and researchers have used a metric of “branching probability” to do so. Previous studies showed that this metric reflects the fractal nature of river networks. However, a recent article by Carraro and Altermatt (2022) contradicted this classical observation and concluded that branching probability is “scale dependent.” I dispute this claim and argue that their major conclusion is derived merely from their misconception of scale invariance. Their analysis in the original article (fig. 3a) provided evidence that branching probability is scale-invariant (i.e., branching probability exhibits a power-law scaling), although the authors erroneously interpreted this result as a sign of scale dependence. In this article, I re-introduce the definition of scale invariance and show that branching probability meets this definition. This provided an opportunity to address the divergent use of “scale invariance” and “scaling” between fractal theory and ecology.},

Contrasting ecosystem states were found between reserve and fished sites, and this persisted over the 22-year study period. Fished sites were predominantly urchin barrens but occasionally fluctuated to short-lived turfs and mixed algal forests, while reserve sites displayed unidirectional successional trajectories toward stable kelp forests (Ecklonia radiata) taking up to three decades following protection.

This results in subject-specific Ising models, where the subject's covariates influence the strength of association between the genes. As in all exploratory data analysis, interpretability of results is important, and we use penalties to induce sparsity in the fitted graphs and in the number of selected covariates. Two algorithms to fit the model are proposed and compared on a set of simulated data, and asymptotic results are established.

	abstract = {Growing populations and agricultural intensification have led to raised riverine nitrogen (N) loads, widespread oxygen depletion in coastal zones (coastal hypoxia)1 and increases in the incidence of algal blooms.Although recent work has suggested that individual wetlands have the potential to improve water quality2–9, little is known about the current magnitude of wetland N removal at the landscape scale. Here we use National Wetland Inventory data and 5-kilometre grid-scale estimates of N inputs and outputs to demonstrate that current N removal by US wetlands (about 860 ± 160 kilotonnes of nitrogen per year) is limited by a spatial disconnect between high-density wetland areas and N hotspots. Our model simulations suggest that a spatially targeted increase in US wetland area by 10 per cent (5.1 million hectares) would double wetland N removal. This increase would provide an estimated 54 per cent decrease in N loading in nitrate-affected watersheds such as the Mississippi River Basin. The costs of this increase in area would be approximately 3.3 billion US dollars annually across the USA—nearly twice the cost of wetland restoration on non-agricultural, undeveloped land—but would provide approximately 40 times more N removal. These results suggest that water quality improvements, as well as other types of ecosystem services such as flood control and fish and wildlife habitat, should be considered when creating policy regarding wetland restoration and protection.},

	abstract = {Increases in nitrogen loading over the past several decades have led to widespread water quality impairments across the U.S. Elevated awareness of the influence of climate variability on nitrogen loading has led to several studies investigating future climate change impacts on water quality. However,  it remains unclear whether long-term climate impacts can already be observed in the historical record. Here, we quantify long-term trends in total nitrogen loading over the period 1987–2012 across the contiguous U.S. and attribute these trends to long-term changes in nitrogen inputs and climatic variables. We find that annual precipitation, extreme springtime precipitation, and springtime temperature are key drivers of trends in historical loading in most regions. These decadal climate trends have either  amplified or offset loading trends expected from nitrogen inputs alone. We also find that rising temperatures have been insufficient to offset precipitation-induced loading increases, suggesting that future increases in temperature under climate change may have limited potential to counteract loading increases expected as a result of anticipated changes in precipitation. This work demonstrates the important role of decadal climate variability in long-term nitrogen loading, emphasizing the need to consider climate change risks when designing and monitoring nutrient reduction programs.},

	abstract = {River basin-scale wetland restoration and creation is a primary management option for mitigating nitrogen-based water quality challenges. However, the magnitude of nitrogen reduction that will result from adding wetlands across large river basins is uncertain, partly because the areal extent, location, and physical and functional characteristics of the wetlands are unknown. We simulated over 3600 wetland restoration scenarios across the ∼450,000 km2 Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) depicting varied assumptions for wetland areal extent, physical and functional characteristics, and placement strategy. These simulations indicated that restoring wetlands will reduce local nitrate yields and nitrate loads at the UMRB outlet. However, the projected magnitude of nitrate reduction varied widely across disparate scenario assumptions─e.g., restoring 4500 km2 of wetlands (i.e., 1\% of UMRB area) decreased mean annual nitrate loads at the UMRB outlet between 3 and 42\%. Higher magnitude nitrate reductions correlated with best-case assumptions, particularly for characteristics controlling nitrate loading rates to the wetlands. These results show that simplified claims about basin-scale wetland-mediated water quality improvements discount the breadth of possible wetland impacts across disparate wetland physical and functional conditions and highlight a need for greater clarity regarding the likelihood of these conditions at river basin scales.},

Accelerated erosion has increased sediment loads and sedimentation rates downstream. High flows could be reduced through increased water storage (e.g., wetlands or detention basins), but quantifying the effectiveness of such a strategy remains a challenge. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate changes in river discharge from various water retention site (WRS) implementation scenarios in the Le Sueur watershed, a tributary basin to the MRB. We also show how high flow attenuation can address turbidity issues by quantifying the impact on near-channel sediment loading in the watershed’s incised reaches. WRS placement in the watershed, hydraulic conductivity (K), and design depth were varied across 135 simulations. The dominant control on site performance is K, with greater flow reductions allowed by higher seepage rates and less frequent overflowing. Deeper design depths enhance flow reductions from sites with low K values. Differences between WRS placement scenarios are slight, suggesting that site placement is not a first-order control on overall performance in this watershed. Flow reductions exhibit power-law scaling with exceedance probability, enabling us to create generalized relationships between WRS extent and flow reductions that accurately reproduce our SWAT results and allow for more rapid evaluation of future scenarios. Overall, we show that increasing water storage within the Le Sueur watershed can be an effective management option for high flow and sediment load reduction.},

	abstract = {Excess nitrogen (N) impairs inland water quality and creates hypoxia in coastal ecosystems. Agriculture is the primary source of N; agricultural management and hydrology together control aquatic ecosystem N loading. Future N loading will be determined by how agriculture and hydrology intersect with climate change, yet the interactions between changing climate and water quality remain poorly understood. Here, we show that changing precipitation patterns, resulting from climate change, interact with agricultural land use to deteriorate water quality. We focus on the 2012–2013 Midwestern U.S. drought as a “natural experiment”. The transition from drought conditions in 2012 to a wet spring in 2013 was abrupt; the media dubbed this “weather whiplash”. We use recent (2010–2015) and historical data (1950–2015) to connect weather whiplash (drought-to-flood transitions) to increases in riverine N loads and concentrations. The drought likely created highly N-enriched soils; this excess N mobilized during heavy spring rains (2013), resulting in a 34\% increase (10.5 vs. 7.8 mg N L−1) in the flow-weighted mean annual nitrate concentration compared to recent years. Furthermore, we show that climate change will likely intensify weather whiplash. Increased weather whiplash will, in part, increase the frequency of riverine N exceeding E.P.A. drinking water standards. Thus, our observations suggest increased climatic variation will amplify negative trends in water quality in a region already grappling with severe impairments.},

The factors that control the spatiotemporal dynamics of riverine nitrate concentration remain difficult to describe and predict. We analyzed nitrate concentration from 4450 sites throughout France to group sites that exhibit similar trend and seasonal behaviors during 2010–2017 and relate these dynamics to catchment characteristics. We employed a latent-variable, Bayesian mixture of harmonic regressions model to infer site clustering based on multi-year trend and annual cycle amplitude and phase. We examined clustering patterns and relationships among nitrate level, trend, and seasonality parameters. Cluster membership probabilities were governed by continuous, latent variables that were informed with seven classes of covariates encompassing geology, hydrology, and land use. To relate interpretable parameters to the covariates, we modeled amplitude and phase separately in a novel framework employing a bivariate phase regression with the projected normal distribution. The analysis identified regional regimes of nitrate dynamics, including trend classifications. This approach can reveal general patterns that transcend small-scale heterogeneity, complementing site-level assessments to inform regional- to national-level progress in water quality.

Here, we develop a method to examine where and for which species shifting isotherms will outpace species dispersal using stream networks of the southern Appalachian Mountains (United States) and their highly speciose and endemic fish fauna as a model system. By exploring alternative tributary and mainstem dispersal pathways, we identify tributaries as slow-climate-velocity pathways along which some fish can successfully disperse and thus keep pace with climate change. Despite accessibility and thermal suitability, non-temperature habitat conditions in tributaries are unsuitable for some dispersing species, thus probably precluding establishment of persistent populations. Our findings demonstrate a trade-off shaping the efficacy of thermal refugia that depends on species-specific habitat associations and reveal individual-level dispersal behaviour, body size and stream network geometry as general correlates of climate change vulnerability.
An assessment of fish movement along stream networks of the southern Appalachian Mountains identifies species-intrinsic sensitivities and habitat characteristics that allow some fish to disperse to keep pace with climate change but prevent successful climate tracking in some species.},

However, the influence of explicit spatial configurations such as dendritic landscapes on the genetic diversity of metapopulations is still understudied, and theoretical corroborations of empirical patterns are largely lacking. Here, we used microsatellite data and stochastic simulations of two metapopulations of freshwater amphipods in a 28,000 km2 riverine network to study the influence of spatial connectivity and dispersal strategies on the spatial distribution of their genetic diversity. We found a significant imprint of the effects of riverine network connectivity on the local and global genetic diversity of both amphipod species. Data from 95 sites showed that allelic richness significantly increased towards more central nodes of the network. This was also seen for observed heterozygosity, yet not for expected heterozygosity. Genetic differentiation increased with instream distance. In simulation models, depending on the mutational model assumed, upstream movement probability and dispersal rate, respectively, emerged as key factors explaining the empirically observed distribution of local genetic diversity and genetic differentiation. Surprisingly, the role of site-specific carrying capacities, for example by assuming a direct dependency of population size on local river size, was less clear cut: while our best fitting model scenario included this feature, over all simulations, scaling of carrying capacities did not increase data-model fit. This highlights the importance of dispersal behaviour along spatial networks in shaping population genetic diversity.},

General understanding of freshwater positive interactions has been far outpaced by knowledge of these important relationships in terrestrial and marine ecosystems.

In 340 studies, we found substantial positive effects, with facilitators increasing beneficiaries by, on average, 81\% across all taxa and response variables. Mollusks in particular were commonly studied as both facilitators and beneficiaries. Amphibians were one group benefiting the most from positive interactions, yet few studies investigated amphibians. Invasive facilitators had stronger positive effects on beneficiaries than non-invasive facilitators. We compared positive effects between high- and low-stress conditions and found no difference in the magnitude of benefit in the subset of studies that manipulated stressors. Future areas of research include understudied facilitators and beneficiaries, the stress gradient hypothesis, patterns across space or time and the influence of declining taxa whose elimination would jeopardise fragile positive interaction networks. Freshwater positive interactions occur among a wide range of taxa, influence populations, communities and ecosystem processes and deserve further exploration.},

There, tipping points occur between two alternative states dominated by either submersed or floating macrophytes depending on nutrient loading. We model the evolution of macrophyte depth in the lake, identify the conditions under which the ancestor population diversifies and investigate whether alternative stable states dominated by different macrophyte phenotypes occur. We find that eco-evolutionary dynamics may lead to alternative stable states, but under restrictive conditions. Such dynamics require sufficient asymmetries in the acquisition of both light and nutrient. Our analysis suggests that competitive asymmetries along opposing resource gradients may allow bistability to emerge by natural selection.},

The theoretical expectation of a positive dispersal-range size relationship has received mixed empirical support, despite dispersal being one of the most prominent hypothesised predictors of range size. Here, we synthesised results from 86 studies examining the dispersal-range size relationship for plants and animals in marine, terrestrial and freshwater realms. Overall, our meta-analysis showed that dispersal positively affects range size, but its effect is dependent on the clade and dispersal proxy studied. Moreover, despite potential differences in habitat connectivity, we did not find an effect of realm on the dispersal-range size relationship. Finally, the strength of the dispersal-range size relationship was dependent on latitude, range size metric and the taxonomic breadth of the study clade. Our synthesis emphasizes the importance of developing a mechanistic understanding of the trait to dispersal to range size relationship, considering the complexity of dispersal departure, transfer and settlement, as well as evolutionary components such as time for range expansion, speciation and past geological–environmental dynamics. We, therefore, call for a more integrative view of the dispersal process and its causal relationship with range size.},

	abstract = {Herbivorous animals tend to seek out plants at intermediate phenological states to improve energy intake while minimizing consumption of fibrous material. In some ecosystems, the timing of green-up is heterogeneous and propagates across space in a wave-like pattern, known as the green wave. Tracking the green wave allows individuals to prolong access to higher-quality forage. While there is a plethora of empirical support for such behavior in herbivorous taxa, the green wave hypothesis (GWH) is nuanced based on factors such as body morphometrics and digestive capacity. Furthermore, little is known about whether other taxa, such as omnivores, track the green wave. Our objective was to assess whether the GWH can be extended to explain the movements of omnivores. Using GPS collar data from seven populations (n = 127 individuals) of brown bears Ursus arctos across their entire North American range, we first tested whether bears tracked the green wave. Using conditional resource selection functions (RSFs), we found that variation in proxies of vegetative forage quality better explained movement and habitat selection than proxies of forage biomass in over half of the bears in our study, providing evidence of green wave tracking. Second, we assess factors that explained variation in green wave tracking using linear mixed effects models. Green wave tracking in brown bears was explained by the variation in availability of green-up within spring home ranges, and how green-up transitioned across those home ranges. Our results demonstrate that the GWH can partially explain movement of a non-migratory omnivorous species, extending the generality of the GWH as a broad predictor of animal space use. The green wave is another resource wave brown bears track, and our findings help predict brown bear space use, which can be used to guide conservation and habitat restoration efforts.},

Animal pollination increased yield stability (by an average of 32\% per unit of yield) at between-flower, -plant, -plot and -field scales. Evidence suggests this occurs because yield benefits of animal pollination become progressively constrained closer to the maximum potential yield in a given context, causing clustering. The increase in yield stability with animal pollination is greatest when yield benefits of animal pollination are greatest, indicating that managing crop pollination to increase yield also increases yield stability. These additional pollination benefits have not yet been included in economic assessments but provide further justification for policies to protect pollinators.},

Our analyses of 50 lake and 48 forest soil communities show that, while species dissimilarity depends on environmental and spatial gradients, these effects are only weakly propagated to the networks. Moreover, our results show that species and food-web dissimilarities are consistently correlated, but that much of the variation in food-web structure across spatial, environmental, and species gradients remains unexplained. Novel food-web assembly models demonstrate the importance of biotic filtering during community assembly by (1) the availability of resources and (2) limiting similarity in species’ interactions to avoid strong niche overlap and thus competitive exclusion. This reveals a strong signature of biotic filtering processes during local community assembly, which constrains the variability in structural food-web patterns across local communities despite substantial turnover in species composition.},

Combining these ecological and molecular data sets allows us to directly measure the relationship between movement and reproduction. Individual dispersal was measured as the total distance moved by a fish during its lifetime. We analysed the effects of dispersal propensity and distance on a variety of reproductive metrics. We found that number of mates and number of offspring were positively correlated to dispersal, especially for males.

We tagged and tracked 401 individual sea trout Salmo trutta with passive integrated transponder telemetry over two to four spawning seasons as they migrated between freshwater and marine environments to spawn and feed respectively. We found the timing (time of river entry) and duration of migration (time spent in freshwater and time spent at sea) to be repeatable within individuals across years. In addition, we identified two peaks in return migration timing; a group of summer-migrating fish and a group of fall-migrating fish. At the time of first spawning, sea trout differed in size depending on how long the first marine phase was, but summer-migrating fish were smaller in all subsequent spawnings. Furthermore, summer-migrating fish had significantly better marine survival than fall-migrating fish. Our study suggests that the timing of arrival in freshwater is an important fitness-relevant trait, such that summer-migrating fish have decreased fitness but remain in somewhat safer conditions, while fall-migrating fish have increased fitness but are exposed to more risky conditions. Taken together, our findings suggest that migration timing and duration is determined via a trade-off between size and survival, which resulted in two evolutionary stable strategies.

When colonisation rates can evolve, longer food-chains can persist. Extinction, perturbation and habitat loss all affect evolutionarily stable colonisation rates, but the strength of the competition-colonisation trade-off has a major role: weaker trade-offs yield longer chains. Although such eco-evo dynamics partly alleviates the spatial constraint on food-chain length, it is no magic bullet: the highest, most vulnerable, trophic levels are also those that least benefit from evolution. We provide qualitative predictions regarding how trait evolution affects the response of communities to disturbance and habitat loss.

	abstract = {Ecologists commonly assess ecological patterns at the population level, focusing on the average response of all individuals within a population, but to predict how populations will respond to land-use change we must understand how changes to habitat differentially affect individuals within a population. For example, forest management is a widespread type of land-use that impacts wildlife through the loss of key habitat features, but individuals within a population may vary in their responses to this loss due to differences in habitat selection among individuals. Specifically, intraspecific variation in habitat selection has been linked to animal personalities (i.e., consistent behavioral differences among conspecifics), but previous research has not examined whether the relationship between personality and habitat selection is influenced by land-use change. To address this knowledge gap, we tested the hypothesis that land-use change alters the association between personality and microhabitat selection in small mammals. Specifically, we investigated two main questions: (1) To what extent are personality type and microhabitat selection correlated among conspecifics? (2) Does land-use change alter individual patterns of microhabitat selection? To answer these questions, we conducted a large-scale field experiment over 4 years, contrasting unmanaged forest (control) with managed forest (two silvicultural treatments) in Maine, USA. We examined the relationships between habitat selection and personality traits in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi). We found that personality traits were correlated with microhabitat selection at multiple spatial scales. Furthermore, land-use change altered these patterns of selection; resulting in either the loss of personality-associated selection or in novel patterns of selection in managed forests. These findings suggest that promoting structural complexity at multiple spatial scales, such as by interspersing stands of mature forest with managed stands, may maintain a variety of intraspecific habitat selection patterns and the associated ecological outcomes.},

Phenotypic plasticity is a mechanism of trait variation that determines how individuals and populations adapt to changing and novel environments. For individuals, the effects of phenotypic plasticity can be quantified by measuring environment–trait relationships, but it is often difficult to predict how phenotypic plasticity affects populations. The assumption that environment–trait relationships validated for individuals indicate how populations respond to environmental change is commonly made without sufficient justification. Here we derive a novel general mathematical framework linking trait variation due to phenotypic plasticity to population dynamics. Applying the framework to the classical example of Nicholson's blowflies, we show how seemingly sensible predictions made from environment–trait relationships do not generalise to population responses. As a consequence, trait-based analyses that do not incorporate population feedbacks risk mischaracterising the effect of environmental change on populations.},

On the one hand, the EFP may seem tautological, because equal fitness is necessary for the origin and persistence of biodiversity. On the other hand, the EFP reflects universal laws of life: how biological metabolism – the uptake, transformation and allocation of energy – links ecological and evolutionary patterns and processes across levels of organisation from: (1) structure and function of individual organisms, (2) life history and dynamics of populations, and (3) interactions and coevolution of species in ecosystems. The physics and biology of metabolism have facilitated the evolution of millions of species with idiosyncratic anatomy, physiology, behaviour and ecology but also with many shared traits and tradeoffs that reflect the single origin and universal rules of life.},

Recent evidence has firmly established the prevalence of intraspecific variation in nature and its relevance in community ecology, yet challenges associated with collecting data on large numbers of individual conspecifics and heterospecifics have hampered integration of individual variation into community ecology. Nevertheless, recent technological and statistical advances in GPS-tracking, remote sensing and behavioural ecology offer a toolbox for integrating intraspecific variation into community processes. More than simply describing where organisms go, movement data provide unique information about interactions and environmental associations from which a true individual-to-community framework can be built. By linking the movement paths of both conspecifics and heterospecifics with environmental data, ecologists can now simultaneously quantify intraspecific and interspecific variation regarding the Eltonian (biotic interactions) and Grinnellian (environmental conditions) factors underpinning community assemblage and dynamics, yet substantial logistical and analytical challenges must be addressed for these approaches to realize their full potential. Across communities, empirical integration of Eltonian and Grinnellian factors can support conservation applications and reveal metacommunity dynamics via tracking-based dispersal data. As the logistical and analytical challenges associated with multi-species tracking are surmounted, we envision a future where individual movements and their ecological and environmental signatures will bring resolution to many enduring issues in community ecology.},

Undersampling corrections have been designed to reduce effects of γ-dependence on β-diversity arising from the problem of incomplete sampling. However, no study has systematically tested the effectiveness of these corrections or examined how well they reflect β-diversity patterns across ecological gradients. Here, we conduct these tests by comparing two undersampling corrections with the widely used individual-based null model approach, using both simulated communities along an ecological gradient and empirical data across a wide range of γ-diversity and sample sizes. We found that undersampling corrections using diversity accumulation curves were more effective than the null-model approaches in removing γ-dependence. In particular, the corrected β-Shannon diversity index was least dependent on γ-diversity, and was the most reflective of the β-diversity pattern along a simulated ecological gradient. Moreover, a corrected Jaccard–Chao index applied to null model results removed γ-dependence more effectively than either the correction alone or the null model alone. Undersampling corrections are effective tools for removing γ-dependence bias, thus facilitating comparisons of β-diversity across regions.},

	abstract = {Theory suggests that intraspecific trait variation will alter species interaction strengths through nonlinear averaging when interaction strengths are nonlinear functions of individuals' traits. This effect is expected to be widespread, yet what factors mediate its magnitude in nature and hence its potential effects on ecosystems and communities are unclear. We sought to quantify how nonlinear predator functional responses, variation in prey densities and counteracting variation in attack rates and handling times among predator individuals of similar body size alter their population-level feeding rates through nonlinear averaging in a natural system, and to determine the processes influencing the net magnitude of this effect. We used a field caging experiment in the rocky intertidal of Oregon, USA to quantify attack-rate variation and feeding rates of the whelk Nucella ostrina on its barnacle and mussel prey. We also used empirically parameterized simulations to examine the effects of handling-time variation among individuals on population-level feeding rates. Within cages, individual attack-rate variation reduced population-level whelk feeding rates. However, the magnitude of this reduction differed among prey species and cages depending on cage-specific magnitudes of attack-rate variation and functional-response nonlinearity. The inferred effects of handling-time variation among individuals were of smaller magnitude than those of attack-rate variation, yet counteracted them to cause a net weakening of the effect of individual attack-rate variation on population-level feeding rates. Across cages, attack-rate and prey-density variation had non-additive effects that produced greater feeding-rate reductions at the experiment scale relative to the cage scale. Our results indicate that the effects of trait variation via nonlinear averaging depend critically on the features of systems that determine the magnitudes of nonlinearities and trait variation. Because of counteracting trait variation, nonlinear-averaging effects may be quite complex, involving both the variances and covariances of all traits and environmental variables influencing the ecological process of interest.

	abstract = {Aim The relationships between species and their landscape are important for understanding migration patterns. In fluvial systems, the complexity of the river network can strongly influence the dispersal and colonization rates of invading alien fishes, but habitat quality, species’ biological traits and their location of introduction are also potentially important. However, understandings of how these factors interact in the wild to influence the spatial distribution of invasive species over time are limited from empirical studies. Location “Virtual” and “real-world” rivers from England and Wales. Method We developed an individual-based model (IBM) to predict how these different factors influenced the invasion dynamics and population growth rates (as abundances) of nine “virtual” alien fishes over two timeframes (10 and 30 years). The alien fishes differed in their demographic (r- to K-selected) and dispersal (fast to slow) characteristics and the rivers in their network complexity. Results Irrespective of river type, species and timeframe, the main drivers of both dispersal and population growth were the location of the introduction and the mean habitat quality of the patch into which the species were released. The introduction location determined whether dispersal was mainly passive in a downstream direction (faster) or active in an upstream direction (slower), with higher habitat quality then enabling faster population growth rates. Over 30 years, invasion rates were predicted to increase as the complexity of the river network increased, as this opened multiple invasion fronts where the invader traits favoured faster dispersal. Main conclusions This novel IBM revealed how the complexity of the physical environment interacts with the biological traits of alien species to influence invasion outcomes, with the location of the introduction and its habitat quality being the most important factors. These results thus substantially increase understanding of the factors that influence the dispersal and colonization rates of alien freshwater fishes.},

Second, we found that community stability is fostered by mean trophic level, while contrary to expectation, it is decreased by species richness. Finally, we found that environmental conditions affect both biomass and its stability mainly via effects on richness and network structure. Strikingly, the effect of species richness on community stability was mediated by population stability rather than synchrony, which contrasts with results from single trophic communities.

Although the hollow curve may be a statistical artefact, ecological processes may induce subtle deviations between empirical species abundance distributions and their statistically most probable forms. These deviations may reflect biological processes operating on top of mathematical constraints and provide new avenues for advancing ecological theory. Examining 22,000 communities, we found that empirical SADs are highly uneven and dominated by rare species compared to their statistical baselines. Efforts to detect deviations may be less informative in small communities—those with few species or individuals—because these communities have poorly resolved statistical baselines. The uneven nature of many empirical SADs demonstrates a path forward for leveraging complexity to understand ecological processes governing the distribution of abundance, while the issues posed by small communities illustrate the limitations of using this approach to study ecological patterns in small samples.},

We sampled nurse and their facilitated plant species in two 1000–2000 m. elevation gradients in Mediterranean Chile where low temperature imposes a mortality filter on seedlings. We first estimated the relative importance of facilitation as a mechanism adding new species to communities distributed along these gradients. We then tested whether the frequency and intensity of facilitation increases with elevation, taking into account the evolutionary relatedness of the nurse species and the facilitated species. We found that nurses increase the species richness of the community by up to 35\%. Facilitative interactions are more frequent than competitive interactions (56\% versus 44\%) and facilitation intensity increased with elevation for interactions involving distantly related lineages. Our results highlight the importance of including an evolutionary dimension in the study of facilitation to have a clearer picture of the mechanisms enabling species to coexist and survive under stressful conditions. This knowledge is especially relevant to conserve vulnerable and threatened communities facing new climate scenarios, such as those located in Mediterranean-type ecosystems.},

Similar processes are expected to act on intra- and interspecific diversity, which should lead to positive co-variation between genetic and species diversity. Although this prediction has been verified within trophic levels, it has rarely been tested across multiple trophic levels. To meet this challenge, we focused on a riverine freshwater ecosystem in which we sampled intra- (genomic diversity) and interspecific (species diversity) data across three trophic levels: riparian trees, benthic macroinvertebrates and fishes. For each trophic level, we quantified α- and β-diversity at both the intra- (SNP diversity within populations of Alnus glutinosa, Gammarus sp. or Phoxinus dragarum) and interspecific levels (species diversity within communities). We first tested for a global spatial co-variation of diversity across trophic levels and diversity facets. We then tested whether relevant environmental parameters similarly affected each biodiversity estimate and explained potential spatial co-variation among biodiversity components. We did not evidence any spatial co-variation of biodiversity across trophic levels and diversity facets, neither for α- nor for β-diversity. We found that sites situated in the Western part of the sampling area had higher α-diversities, and that highly connected sites had lower β-diversities, which holds true for all trophic levels and diversity facets. Nonetheless, the effects of other environmental predictors were specific to each biodiversity component, likely explaining the absence of spatial co-variation among biodiversity components. Our study demonstrates that global biodiversity patterns in rivers can be hard to generalize and are rather idiosyncratic, even though a few processes might have consistent impacts on biodiversity components across trophic levels.},

	abstract = {Cannibalism is taxonomically widespread and can have large impacts on individual fitness and population-level processes. As such, identifying how cannibalism rates vary in response to ecological cues is important for predicting species evolution and population dynamics. In this study, we aimed to identify several eco-evolutionary factors that affect cannibalism rate and measure how they interacted with one another. To do this, we conducted two experiments using complimentary methods to measure how cannibalism rates varied among larval Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans in response to changes in conspecific relatedness, social familiarity and density. We found that larvae were more likely to cannibalise non-related larval victims in both species, and that this effect increased at high densities in D. simulans. We found no evidence that Drosophila larvae use social familiarity to assess relatedness. Finally, in D. melanogaster, cannibalistic larvae prefer to cannibalise larvae that are being attacked by a greater number of conspecifics, implying that cues linked to conspecific abundance encourage cooperative cannibalism. By showing that cannibalism frequency in Drosophila spp. is sensitive to relatedness and several other factors, we reveal the complex relationship between cannibalism frequency and species ecology. Also, by showing that the effect of relatedness on cannibalism frequency is density dependent, we advance the current understanding of how ecological variables interact to affect kin selection.

	abstract = {The Amazon catchment is the largest river basin on earth, and up to 30\% of its waters flow across floodplains. In its open waters, floating plants known as floating meadows abound. They can act as vectors of dispersal for their associated fauna and, therefore, can be important for the spatial structure of communities. Here, we focus on amphibian diversity in the Amazonian floating meadows over large spatial scales. We recorded 50 amphibian species over 57 sites, covering around 7000 km along river courses. Using multi-site generalised dissimilarity modelling of zeta diversity, we tested Hanski's core-satellite hypothesis and identified the existence of two functional groups of species operating under different ecological processes in the floating meadows. ‘Core' species are associated with floating meadows, while ‘satellite' species are associated with adjacent environments, being only occasional or accidental occupants of the floating vegetation. At large scales, amphibian diversity in floating meadows is mostly determined by stochastic (i.e. random/neutral) processes, whereas at regional scales, climate and deterministic (i.e. niche-based) processes are central drivers. Compared with the turnover of ‘core' species, the turnover of ‘satellite' species increases much faster with distances and is also controlled by a wider range of climatic features. Distance is not a limiting factor for ‘core' species, suggesting that they have a stronger dispersal ability even over large distances. This is probably related to the existence of passive long-distance dispersal of individuals along rivers via vegetation rafts. In this sense, Amazonian rivers can facilitate dispersal, and this effect should be stronger for species associated with riverine habitats such as floating meadows.},

Using long-term monitoring data of butterfly assemblages, we tested the effects of the amount and distribution of semi-natural habitat (SNH), moderated by species traits, on climate-driven species turnover. We found that spatially dispersed SNH favoured the colonisation of warm-adapted and mobile species. In contrast, extinction risk of cold-adapted species increased in dispersed (as opposed to aggregated) habitats and when the amount of SNH was low. Strengthening habitat networks by maintaining or creating stepping-stone patches could thus allow warm-adapted species to expand their range, while increasing the area of natural habitat and its spatial cohesion may be important to aid the local persistence of species threatened by a warming climate.},

Contrary to our hypothesis, increasing community complexity, measured either as the number of guilds or community richness, did not decrease community feasibility. Rather, we observed that high degrees of species self-regulation and niche partitioning allow for maintaining larger levels of community feasibility and higher species persistence in more diverse communities.

	abstract = {Knowledge of how biodiversity sustains ecosystem function comes predominantly from studies focused on small spatial scales. Thus, we know relatively little about the role of biodiversity at larger scales of space and time where habitats become increasingly heterogeneous. Efforts to upscale the relationship between biodiversity and function have yielded inconclusive results. Given that increasing habitat heterogeneity is a ubiquitous consequence of increasing spatial scale, we asked: as habitat heterogeneity increases, can single species continue to maintain ecosystem function? Or, does transgressive overyielding (functioning of species mixture divided by the functioning of the highest functioning single species) change with habitat heterogeneity? We addressed this using a combination of computer simulations, an experiment and a meta-analysis. The three parts followed the same rationale: habitat heterogeneity was increased by aggregating local habitats with different conditions into larger and more heterogeneous landscapes. The computer simulations showed that, on average, transgressive overyielding increased with habitat heterogeneity because monoculture functioning decreased with habitat heterogeneity. We tested this expectation experimentally by varying the strain richness from one to five species across 10800 bacterial communities in five different habitats defined by sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. On average, the experimental results concurred with the simulations. We tested the generality of this result using a meta-analysis of 26 published experiments that manipulated habitat conditions and species richness. This confirmed that transgressive overyielding tended to increase with habitat heterogeneity but only when species were specialised to different habitats and were not inhibited in mixtures by negative species interactions. This was not the case in several experiments used in our meta-analysis where one species maximised functioning across all habitats, contrary to the assumptions of many ecological models. Our results illustrate the importance of biodiversity at larger spatial scales with more heterogeneity but also highlights contingencies that this pattern depends on.},

After a pointed call for research on subsidies in the 1990s, an industry of empirical work has documented the ubiquitous role subsidies play in ecosystem structure, stability, and function. Here, we argue that physical constraints (e.g., water temperature) and species traits can govern a species' accessibility to resource subsidies, which has been largely overlooked in the subsidy literature. We examined the input of a high-quality, point-source anthropogenic subsidy (aquaculture feed) into a recipient freshwater lake food web. Using a combined bio-tracer approach, we detect a gradient in accessibility of the anthropogenic subsidy within the surrounding food web driven by the thermal preferences of three constituent species, effectively rewiring the recipient lake food web. Because aquaculture is predicted to increase significantly in coming decades to support growing human populations, and global change is altering temperature regimes, then this form of food web alteration may be expected to occur frequently. We argue that subsidy accessibility is a key characteristic of recipient food web interactions that must be considered when trying to understand the impacts of subsidies on ecosystem stability and function under continued global change.},

We investigated whether those habitat size-dependent properties influenced community instability and vulnerability to perturbations caused by disturbance. This is particularly important given human exploitation is contracting ecosystems, and abiotic perturbations are becoming more severe and frequent. We used a perturbation experiment in which ten streams, spanning three-orders of magnitude in habitat size, were subjected to simulated bed movement akin to a major flood disturbance event. We measured the resistance, resilience, and variability of basal resources, and population and community-level responses across the stream habitat size gradient immediately before, and at 0.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 days post-disturbance. Resistance to disturbance consistently increased with stream size in all response variables. In contrast, resilience was significantly higher in smaller streams for some response variables. However, this higher resilience of small ecosystems was insufficient to compensate for their lower resistance, and communities of smaller streams were thus more variable over time than those of larger streams. Compensatory dynamics of populations, especially for predators, stabilized some aspects of communities, but these mechanisms were unrelated to habitat size. Together, our results provide compelling evidence for the links between habitat size and community stability, and should motivate ecologists and managers to consider how changes in the size of habitats will alter the vulnerability of ecosystems to perturbations caused by environmental disturbance.},

Here, we use a food chain model in which autotroph diversity is described by a continuous distribution of a trait that affects both growth and defence against heterotrophs. On isolated patches, diversity is always lost over time due to stabilising selection, and the local communities settle on one of two alternative stable community states that are characterised by a dominance of either defended or undefended species. In a metacommunity context, dispersal can destabilise these states and complex spatio-temporal patterns in the species’ abundances emerge.

	abstract = {Positive biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships observed in experiments can be challenging to identify in natural communities. Freshwater animal communities are disproportionately harmed by global change that results in accelerated species loss. Understanding how animal-mediated ecosystems functions may change as a result of global change can help determine whether biodiversity or species-specific conservation will be effective at maintaining function. Unionid mussels represent half of imperiled species in freshwater ecosystems globally and perform important ecological functions such as water filtration and nutrient recycling. We explored BEF relationships for 22 naturally assembled mussel aggregations spanning three river basins. We used the Price equation to partition the contributions of species richness, composition, and context dependent interactions to two functions of interests: spatially-explicit standing-stock biomass (indirect proxy for function) and species-specific nitrogen (N) excretion rates (direct measure of N recycling). Random and non-random species loss each reduced biomass and N recycling. Many rare species with low contributions to biomass contributed to standing-stock biomass in all basins. Widespread species had variable function across sites, such that context dependent effects (CDEs) outweighed richness effects on standing-stock biomass in two basins, and were similar to richness effects in the third. Richness effects outweighed CDEs for N recycling. Thus, many species contributed a low proportion to overall N-recycling; a product we attribute to the high evenness and functional effect trait diversity associated with these communities. The loss of low-functioning species reduced the function of persisting species. This novel result using observational data adds evidence that positive species interactions, such as interspecific facilitation, may be a mechanism by which biodiversity enhances ecosystem functions. Our work stresses the importance of evaluating species-specific contributions to functions in diverse systems, such as nutrient cycling when maintaining specific animal-mediated functions is a management goal because indirect proxies may not completely characterize BEF relationships.},

We used process-based simulations to identify β-diversity metrics and community–environment measures that were appropriate to investigate the role of assembly processes along a gradient of community size. We show that variation in species composition among small communities is higher than among large communities and that the strength of community–environment relationships is weaker in small communities.

Here, we develop a “virtual ecologist” approach to evaluate assembly processes by simulating metacommunities varying in three main processes: density-independent responses to abiotic conditions, density-dependent biotic interactions, and dispersal. We then calculate a number of commonly used summary statistics of community structure in space and time and use random forests to evaluate their utility for inferring the strength of these three processes. We find that (i) both spatial and temporal data are necessary to disentangle metacommunity processes based on the summary statistics we test, and including statistics that are measured through time increases the explanatory power of random forests by up to 59\% compared to cases where only spatial variation is considered; (ii) the three studied processes can be distinguished with different descriptors; and (iii) each summary statistic is differently sensitive to temporal and spatial sampling effort. Including repeated observations of metacommunities over time was essential for inferring the metacommunity processes, particularly dispersal. Some of the most useful statistics include the coefficient of variation of species abundances through time and metrics that incorporate variation in the relative abundances (evenness) of species. We conclude that a combination of methods and summary statistics is probably necessary to understand the processes that underlie metacommunity assembly through space and time, but we recognize that these results will be modified when other processes or summary statistics are used.},

Understanding how such biological invasions occur and succeed is thus of high priority. Both local properties and the spatial network structure have been shown to be determinants of invasion success, and the identification of spatial invasion hubs directly promoting invasion dynamics is gaining attention. Spatial dynamics, however, could also indirectly alter invasion success by shaping pre-invasion local community structure: in many ecosystems, such as riverine networks, regional properties such as patch size distribution are known drivers of local community structures, which themselves may affect the establishment success of invading species. Using microcosm experiments in dendritic networks, we disentangled how inherent patch size distribution and dispersal along specific network topologies shaped local resident communities, and, subsequently, affected the establishment success of invading species. After controlling for regional scale effects of connectivity on pre-invasion diversity, we find that patch size distributions independently shaped pre-invasion community diversity and invasion success, with no direct effect of pre-invasion diversity on invasion success. Our results suggest that 1) landscape configuration plays an underestimated role in invasion success and that 2) invasion success should follow predictable landscape-scale patterns in riverine networks given non-random patch-size distribution.},

Our meta-analysis of 395 vertebrate species shows that global climate gradients in temperature and precipitation exert indirect effects via primary productivity, generally reducing space requirements. Human pressure, however, reduces realised space use due to ensuing limitations in available habitat, particularly for large carnivores. We show that human pressure drives extinction risk by increasing the mismatch between space requirements and availability.

	abstract = {Climate change has led to widespread shifts in the timing of key life history events between interacting species (phenological asynchrony) with hypothesized cascading negative fitness impacts on one or more of the interacting species—often termed ‘mismatch’. Yet, predicting the types of systems prone to mismatch remains a major hurdle. Recent reviews have argued that many studies do not provide strong evidence of the underlying match-mismatch hypothesis, but none have quantitatively analysed support for it. Here, we test the hypothesis by estimating the prevalence of mismatch across antagonistic trophic interactions in terrestrial systems and then examine whether studies that meet the assumptions of the hypothesis are more likely to find a mismatch. Despite a large range of synchrony to asynchrony, we did not find general support for the hypothesis. Our results thus question the general applicability of this hypothesis in terrestrial systems, but they also suggest specific types of data missing to robustly refute it. We highlight the critical need to define resource seasonality and the window of ‘match’ for the most rigorous tests of the hypothesis. Such efforts are necessary if we want to predict systems where mismatches are likely to occur.},

	abstract = {Biomass production in ecosystems is a complex process regulated by several facets of biodiversity and species identity, but also species interactions such as competition or complementarity between species. For studying these different facets separately, ecosystem biomass is generally partitioned in two biodiversity effects. The composition effect is a simple, linear effect, and the interaction effect is a more subtle, nonlinear effect. Here we used a clustering approach (1) to separately and comprehensively capture all linear and nonlinear effects induced by both biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning, and (2) to determine the functional composition at the origin of each biodiversity effect. We used data from the long-term Cedar Creek BioDIV experiment carried out over 22 yr, and we partitioned multiplicatively the biomass in composition and interaction effects. Both biodiversity effects were weakly correlated. Our clustering approach accurately explains and predicts each diversity effect over time: each one is modeled by a different functional composition. Even if environmental conditions and the strength of interaction effect strongly varied over time, the functional clusters of species that govern the interaction effect do not change over the 22 yr of the experiment. The functional composition governing the interaction effect is therefore very robust. In contrast, the functional clusters of species that govern the composition effect are less robust and change with environmental conditions. Understanding ecosystem functioning therefore requires that ecological properties are first partitioned by type, then each type of property is analyzed and modeled separately. Approaches without a priori groupings of species, such as functional clustering, appear particularly efficient and robust to unravel the web of species interactions, and identify the role played by species on biodiversity effects.},

Although chemical pesticide applications generally result in short-term decreases of pest densities, densities can subsequently resurge to higher levels than before. Thus, pesticide effects on pest densities beyond a single pest generation may vary, but they have not been reviewed in a systematic manner. Using mathematical predator–prey models, we show that pest resurgence is expected when effective natural enemies are present, even when they are less sensitive to pesticides than the pest. Model simulations over multiple pest generations predict that pest resurgence due to pesticide applications will increase average pest densities throughout a growing season when effective natural enemies are present. We tested this prediction with a meta-analysis of published data of field experiments that compared effects of chemical control of arthropod plant pests in the presence and absence of natural enemies. This largely confirmed our prediction: overall, pesticide applications did not reduce pest densities significantly when natural enemies were present, which concerned the vast majority of cases. We also show that long-term pesticide effectiveness is underreported and suggest that pest control by natural enemies deserves more attention.},

Using a novel approach to analyse long-term data of 66 amphibian species pairs across eight communities, we demonstrate that phenological shifts can significantly alter the interaction potential of coexisting competitors. Importantly, these changes in interaction potential were mediated by non-uniform, species-specific shifts in entire phenological distributions and consequently could not be captured by metrics traditionally used to quantify phenological shifts. Ultimately, these non-uniform shifts in phenological distributions increased the interaction potential for 25\% of species pairs (and did not reduce interaction potential for any species pair), altering temporal community structure and potentially increasing interspecific competition. These results demonstrate the potential of phenological shifts to reshape temporal structure of natural communities, emphasising the importance of considering entire phenological distributions of natural populations.},

We tested whether forest vegetation volume, as a 3D extension of area in SARs, was a significant predictor of taxonomic (species) and structural (arrangement) diversity in five groups of organisms across the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). Vegetation volume and four structural arrangement metrics within the area of NEON plots were measured using NEON's discrete return lidar. Species richness was measured as the number of species within the respective NEON plot sampling area for understory plants, trees, breeding land birds, small mammals, and ground beetles. We found that volume negatively predicted understory plants and positively predicted tree and beetle species richness across the USA forest macrosystem, but not bird and small mammal species richness. Furthermore, volume was a significant predictor of several metrics that describe the internal and external heterogeneity of vegetation in forests (structural arrangement) within the ecosystem across the USA forest macrosystem. There were several significant within site-level relationships, but not at all sites, between volume and species richness or structural arrangement in organism groups. Our study indicates that previous work that has focused on a 2D conceptualization of habitat can be expanded to 3D habitat space, but that the strength and the positive or negative direction of DVRs may vary taxonomically or geographically.},

	abstract = {Both competition for water and phenological variation are important determinants of plant community structure, but ecologists lack a synthetic theory for how they affect coexistence outcomes. We developed an analytically tractable model of water competition for Mediterranean annual communities and demonstrated that variation in phenology alone can maintain high diversity in spatially homogenous assemblages of water-limited plants. We modelled a system where all water arrives early in the season and species vary in their ability to grow under drying conditions. As a consequence, species differ in growing season length and compete by shortening the growing season of their competitors. This model replicates and offers mechanistic explanations for patterns observed in empirical studies of how phenology influences coexistence among Mediterranean annuals. Additionally, we found that a decreasing, concave-up trade-off between growth rate and access to water can maintain high diversity under simple but realistic assumptions. High diversity is possible because: (1) later plants escape competition after their earlier season competitors have gone to seed and (2) early-season species are more than compensated for their shortened growing season by a growth rate advantage. Together, these mechanisms provide an explanation for how phenologically variable annual plant species might coexist when competing only for water.},

To estimate species distribution, occupancy models are a flexible framework that can accommodate several data sets obtained from different sampling methods. However, repeating visits at sampling sites is a prerequisite for using standard occupancy models. Occupancy models were recently developed to analyze detection/non-detection data collected during a single visit. To date, single-visit occupancy models have never been used to integrate several different data sets. Here, we showcase an approach that combines two data sets into an integrated single-visit occupancy model. As a case study, we estimated the distribution of common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) over the northwestern Mediterranean Sea by combining 24,624 km of aerial surveys and 21,464 km of at-sea monitoring. We compared the outputs of single- vs. repeated-visit occupancy models into integrated occupancy models. Integrated models allowed a better sampling coverage of the targeted population, which provided a better precision for occupancy estimates than occupancy models using data sets in isolation. Overall, single- and repeated-visit integrated occupancy models produced similar inference about the distribution of bottlenose dolphins. We suggest that single-visit occupancy models open promising perspectives for the use of existing ecological data sets.},

Our results showed (1) that carbon : nutrient ratios of primary producers decreased along the eutrophication gradient, while the elemental composition of consumers remained homeostatic, and (2) that the trophic position of several omnivores and the generalist predator Notonecta decreased, while the trophic position of most other consumers remained constant.

	abstract = {Changing ecological conditions along environmental gradients influence patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. However, how networks of interacting species respond to these changes remains unclear. We quantified aquatic food webs along longitudinal stream gradients spanning the Rocky Mountain–Great Plains ecotone using community composition, functional traits, and stable isotopes. We predicted that increasing ecosystem size, productivity, and species richness along the gradient would positively influence aquatic trophic diversity (e.g., expanded vertical and horizontal trophic niche breadths). We also predicted that trophic redundancy among fish species would decrease moving downstream as species partition food resources (e.g., reduced trophic niche overlap). Consumer stable isotope data (δ13C and δ15N) revealed nonlinear changes in trophic diversity along the gradient. Invertebrate trophic diversity had a dome-shaped relationship with the gradient, strongly linked to an expanding then contracting δ13C range. Fish trophic diversity initially increased and then plateaued downstream, despite linearly expanding δ13C and δ15N ranges. Trophic redundancy within the fish community decreased downstream along the gradient. However, trophic redundancy also showed a nonlinear relationship with fish species richness; it initially declined, then began to increase when more than nine species were present, indicating a shift from niche partitioning to niche packing at intermediate species richness levels. This result suggests that while δ13C and δ15N ranges for fish communities increased across the gradient, niche packing within communities in the Great Plains caused overall trophic diversity to saturate. Our results demonstrate that food web structure along stream gradients reflects an interaction between factors that decrease trophic redundancy, such as increased living space and niche partitioning, versus factors that increase trophic redundancy, such as increased species richness and niche packing. Our study helps to explain how multiple mechanisms shape food web properties along longitudinal stream gradients, and where niche partitioning or niche packing may be dominant. Understanding the functional roles of organisms across similar environmental gradients in other ecosystems will be increasingly important because they determine how food webs, and thus ecosystem function, will respond to environmental change, biodiversity loss, or species invasions.},

	abstract = {Dispersal is one of the most important drivers of community assembly. Understanding how dispersal impacts spatial variations in community composition (beta diversity) is crucial for predicting biodiversity change during the Anthropocene. Classic theories and a large amount of empirical evidence have led to a common belief that increasing dispersal rate should lead to regional community homogenization (lower beta diversity). However, recent empirical studies show that increasing dispersal can also lead to regional community divergence when interacting with other processes such as disturbance and priority effect. The underappreciation of the complex relationship between beta diversity and dispersal might impede our ability to make accurate ecological forecasts. To address this concern, I examine the beta diversity–dispersal relationship through extinction and colonization dynamics in meta-community models. I find that a wide range of beta diversity–dispersal relationships (e.g. negative, positive, hump-shaped) can be generated by changes in species-level occurrence probabilities when meta-population dispersal (rather than mainland–island dispersal), disturbance and strong biotic interactions are at play. Specifically, reducing the variance of species-level occurrence probabilities leads to community divergence and increasing the mean occurrence probability leads to community homogenization; a positive or hump-shaped beta diversity–dispersal relationship emerges when the effect of the decreasing variance is stronger than the effect of increasing mean. These findings highlight the intrinsic constraint of occupancy stochasticity on beta diversity changes and echo the call for more realistic manipulations of stochastic dispersal and a detailed understanding of the interaction networks to test various beta diversity–dispersal relationships in future empirical studies.},

	abstract = {The coexistence of competing species requires density feedbacks that have a larger effect on their own species' population growth than they do on others in the assembly. The feedbacks are often associated with behavioral tradeoffs that enable species to differentially exploit underlying axes of heterogeneity. Conjoining theories of species coexistence with foraging behavior and density-dependent habitat selection reveals that such tradeoffs impinge on invasion probabilities and equilibrium dynamics emerging from species' differences in habitat use. The resulting habitat separation promotes coexistence by reducing the overall interaction among species. Differential habitat selection depends on the behavioral abilities of organisms to identify and exploit the most profitable habitats and resource patches. One might thus expect that each species will evolve behavioral types distinct from those of other potential competitors. Accordingly, we exposed four coexisting species in four genera of boreal rodents to open-field tests. We used principal components (PC) to summarize their behaviors along three independent axes corresponding with clines of exploratory, vigilant, and apprehensive personalities. We confirmed that the axes represented repeatable behaviors (personalities) and assessed differences among species with a general linear model (GLM). The GLM revealed highly distinct differences among species, and between pairs of species, on each PC. Even so, it is difficult to infer the adaptive advantages of personality to the habitat segregation that reduces otherwise high interactions among species. Rather, personalities are best interpreted as co-adaptive behaviors reflecting the complex of morphological, physiological and behavioral attributes that dictate tradeoffs and enable coexistence.},

We predicted that: (a) niche processes would dominate at high latitudes due to increased climatic stress, consistent with the physiological tolerance hypothesis and the Dobzhansky–MacArthur hypothesis and (b) dispersal limitation would prevail at low latitudes due to narrower niches and smaller range sizes, as postulated by the dispersal–ecological specialization trade-off hypothesis, the latitude–niche breadth hypothesis, and Rapoport's rule. Location Central United States. Time period 1993–2019. Major taxa studied Stream algae, insects, and fish. Methods We examined the relative effects of environment (climate and physicochemistry) versus space on stream biodiversity in seven latitudinal zones, spanning 19 latitudinal degrees. In each zone, species richness (α-diversity) was analysed with multiple regression and variance partitioning. Compositional dissimilarity (β-diversity) within zones was assessed with distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) and variance partitioning. Results For α-diversity, latitudinal variability of niche and dispersal processes conformed to our predictions in all three groups, except for dispersal processes in insects. However, the drivers of β-diversity did not follow our predictions. The latitude–niche breadth hypothesis and Rapoport's rule were weakly supported only in fish. Main conclusions The importance of niche and dispersal processes varied predictably along the latitudinal gradient only for α-diversity. However, the niche effects were driven mostly by physicochemistry, and the dispersal effects were not always linked with ecological specialization and range size. This suggests that climate-based biodiversity theories do not have particular relevance for the streams in our study. Niche processes had a greater impact than dispersal processes across species groups and diversity metrics, emphasizing the primary role of the environment.},

	abstract = {While climate change is altering ecosystems on a global scale, not all ecosystems are responding in the same way. The resilience of ecological communities may depend on whether food webs are producer- or detritus-based (i.e. ‘green’ or ‘brown’ food webs, respectively), or both (i.e. ‘multi-channel’ food web). Food web theory suggests that the presence of multiple energy pathways can enhance community stability and resilience and may modulate the responses of ecological communities to disturbances such as climate change. Despite important advances in food web theory, few studies have empirically investigated the resilience of ecological communities to climate change stressors in ecosystems with different primary energy channels. We conducted a factorial experiment using outdoor stream mesocosms to investigate the independent and interactive effects of warming and drought on invertebrate communities in food webs with different energy channel configurations. Warming had little effect on invertebrates, but stream drying negatively impacted total invertebrate abundance, biomass, richness and diversity. Although resistance to drying did not differ among energy channel treatments, recovery and overall resilience were higher in green mesocosms than in mixed and brown mesocosms. Resilience to drying also varied widely among taxa, with larger predatory taxa exhibiting lower resilience. Our results suggest that the effects of drought on stream communities may vary regionally and depend on whether food webs are fuelled by autochthonous or allochthonous basal resources. Communities inhabiting streams with large amounts of organic matter and more complex substrates that provide refugia may be more resilient to the loss of surface water than communities inhabiting streams with simpler, more homogeneous substrates.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models have grown in complexity by incorporating fine-scale variables, including data on microclimate, physiology and species interactions. Recent studies have acknowledged the importance of the spatial scale by including higher resolution maps and more complex climatic variables. However, models rarely consider the consequences of including data related to time. Indeed, species phenology – and potential shifts in phenology due, for example, to climate change – is potentially one of the most neglected aspects of ecological modelling. We present a literature review of relevant phenological aspects at different temporal scales and across several taxa. Such elements should be considered to define better the environmental niche and project present, future and past distribution models. We considered the available studies on plants, insects, reptiles, birds and mammals to evaluate how they dealt with the phenology of the investigated species, as well as the phenology of other resources and interacting species, to infer present, past and future projections. Here we focus on four main phenological aspects that, if not considered, may easily bias any projection, namely: 1) phenology can be accompanied by a shift in distribution within the year (e.g. migratory species); 2) activity may be restricted to a portion of the year (e.g. most ectotherms from temperate climates); 3) survival and reproduction success may depend on the synchrony with other species phenology (e.g. plants–pollinators interactions); 4) changes in climatic conditions can lead to shifts in phenology (e.g. anticipated or delayed blooms or changes in migration timing). In this review, we show how neglecting such factors may quickly lead to project a biased distribution. Finally, we provide a guide on evaluating whether the case study may be affected by such factors and what actions may improve the models.},

However, potentially vital dispersal behaviours have so far been neglected. Social species have been demonstrated to use their own breeding performance (personal information) and the breeding performance of their conspecifics (public information) to inform both their emigration and settlement decisions. Here, to provide insight into how these behaviours may impact range expansion dynamics, we extend a recently-developed individual-based model that incorporates the use of personal and public information in emigration decisions and a prospecting phase informing settlement decisions. We find that compared to non-informed emigration, informed emigration results in slower range expansions, except when individuals prospect a high number of patches or when their perceptual range is high. Spread rate and also the extent of the front strongly depend upon the willingness of individuals to settle in an empty patch. Given the likely prevalence of prospecting and informed dispersal across a wide range of taxa, these results indicate an urgent need for further empirical and modelling studies to improve our understanding and predictive capability of how species exhibiting this informed dispersal strategy will respond to environmental changes.},

	abstract = {Environmental change jeopardizes the survival of species from variable environments by making the occurrence of favorable conditions less predictable. For organisms with long-lived propagules (e.g., spores, eggs, or seeds), the theory of diversified bet hedging (DBH) predicts that delayed hatching over different growing seasons can help populations avoid extinction. Empirical observations in different organisms are consistent with DBH, but integrated tests that simultaneously validate the main theoretical assumptions and predictions are lacking. In this study, we combine field and multi-generational lab experiments to provide a complete test of DBH. Consistent with DBH predictions, resting egg clutches of the fairy shrimp Branchipodopsis wolfi, which inhabits rain-fed temporary rock pool environments with unpredictable inundations, hatched partially over a succession of inundations with identical hatching cues. Bet hedging was more common in populations from more unpredictable habitats where hatching fractions were lower. This differentiation in hatching strategies was preserved after two generations under common garden conditions, which implies intrinsic (epi-)genetic control of hatching. Finally, a demographic model confirmed that lower hatching fractions increase long-term population growth in unpredictable habitats. With this paper we propose a method to calculate probabilities of successful recruitment for organisms that use imperfect cues and show that this drives selection for variation in life history strategies as part of a DBH strategy.},

Darwin hypothesised that abiotic factors generally impose species’ high-latitude and high-elevation (typically cool) range limits, whereas biotic interactions more often impose species’ low-latitude/low-elevation (typically warm) limits, but empirical support has been mixed. Here, we clarify three predictions arising from Darwin's hypothesis and show that previously mixed support is partially due to researchers testing different predictions. Using a comprehensive literature review (885 range limits), we find that biotic interactions, including competition, predation and parasitism, contributed to {\textgreater}60\% of range limits and influenced species’ warm limits more often than cool limits. Abiotic factors contributed more often than biotic interactions to cool range limits, but temperature contributed frequently to both cool and warm limits. Our results suggest that most range limits will be sensitive to climate warming, but warm-limit responses in particular will depend strongly on biotic interactions.},

The four manipulated predators included the small painted goby and common prawn, which are also fed on by the larger black goby and shore crab. Antagonistic interactions between the manipulated predators (e.g., intraguild predation, intimidation, interference competition) limited their negative effects on the rest of the food web. Top-down control was so suppressed at the highest level of multitrophic diversity that the resulting food webs were as complex and productive as those containing no manipulated predators. Negative interactions between the predators weakened as multitrophic diversity decreased, however, resulting in stronger consumption of lower trophic levels and a simpler food web with lower rates of two key ecosystem processes: primary production and decomposition. These results show how indirect interactions between predators on multiple trophic levels help to promote the complexity and functioning of natural systems.},

Teleost lineages range from deep-bodied to elongate (e.g. eels, needlefish), laterally compressed (e.g. ribbonfish) to globular (e.g. pufferfish) and include uniquely shaped lineages such as seahorses, flatfishes and ocean sunfishes. Adaptive body shape convergence within fishes has long been hypothesized but the nature of the relationships between fish form and ecological and environmental variables remain largely unknown at the macroevolutionary scale. To facilitate the investigation of the interacting factors influencing teleost body shape evolution we measured 8 functionally relevant linear traits on adult-sized specimens along with specimen mass. Linear measurements of standard length, maximum body depth, maximum fish width, lower jaw length, mouth width, head depth, minimum caudal peduncle depth and minimum caudal peduncle width were taken in millimeters with calipers, or tape measures for oversized specimens. We measured these traits on a total of 16523 specimens (1-3 specimens per species) at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and took approximately 7000 person hours of data collection to complete. The data went through a three-step error-checking process to clean and validate the data and then species averages were calculated. We present the complete specimen dataset, which encompasses approximately one fifth of extant teleost species diversity, spanning 90\% of teleost families and 96\% of orders.

	abstract = {Trophic cascades – indirect effects of predators that propagate down through food webs – have been extensively documented in many ecosystem types. It has also been shown that predator diversity can mediate these trophic cascades and, separately, that herbivore biomass can influence the stability of primary producers. However, whether predator diversity can cause cascading effects on the stability of lower trophic levels has not yet been studied. We conducted a laboratory microcosm experiment and a field mesocosm experiment manipulating the presence and coexistence of two heteropteran predators and measuring their effects on zooplankton herbivores and phytoplankton basal resources. We predicted that if the predators partitioned their zooplankton prey, for example by size, then the co-presence of the predators would reduce zooplankton prey mass and lead to (1) increased biomass of, and (2) decreased temporal variability of phytoplankton basal resources. We present evidence that the predators partitioned their zooplankton prey, leading to a synergistic suppression of zooplankton. In turn, this enhanced zooplankton suppression led to only a weak, non-significant increase in the central tendency of phytoplankton biomass, but significantly reduced its variability. Our results demonstrate that predator diversity may indirectly stabilize basal resource biomass via a “diversity-stability trophic cascade,” seemingly dependent on predator complementarity, even when there is no significant classic trophic cascade altering the central tendency of biomass. Therefore predator diversity, especially if correlated with diversity of prey use, could play a role in regulating ecosystem stability. This link between predator diversity and producer stability has implications for conservation and for potential biological control methods to improve crop yield reliability.},

We simulated climate warming and top predator loss in natural microcosms to investigate their direct and indirect effects on temporal stability of microbial communities and the role of underlying stabilising mechanisms. Community stability was insensitive to warming, but indirectly decreased due to top predator loss via increased mesopredator abundance and consequent reduction of species asynchrony and species stability. The magnitude of destabilising effects differed among trophic levels, being disproportionally higher at lower trophic levels (e.g. producers). Our study unravels major patterns and causal mechanisms by which trophic downgrading destabilises large food webs, regardless of climate warming scenarios.},

These phenology-driven effects potentially can be strengthened by seasonal time constraints caused by a short growth season, and depend on latitude. Here the single and combined effects of phenology and latitude-associated time constraints on SMPEs in larvae of an aquatic insect, the damselfly Lestes sponsa, are studied. We did so by rearing larvae in groups of 16 individuals with different phenology (hatching date) thereby imposing strong intraspecific competition, resulting in cannibalism. We thereby manipulated in a fully crossed way time constraints (combination of temperature and photoperiod: thermo-photoperiod) in larvae from low-latitude and more time constrained high-latitude populations, and examined effects on life history (survival, development, growth) and physiology (fat and protein contents, and phenoloxidase activity as a measure of immune function). Phenology, time constraints and latitude of origin had strong effects on life history, but only the time constraint affected the physiology. We detected a SMPE for survival that, however, was not stronger under time constraints and was consistent in strength between latitudes. Phenology and time constraints interacted for development and growth in a direction suggesting adaptive responses to time constraints but these life history traits did not show SMPEs. We provided important insights in the study of SMPEs thereby showing these to be trait-dependent and not more pronounced under experimentally manipulated or latitude-associated time constraints. Our study thereby makes an important addition to geographic variation in SMPEs, a largely neglected topic.},

Other authors have already extrapolated this result to infer negative fragmentation effects, that is, higher biodiversity in a few large than many small patches of the same cumulative habitat area. We test whether this extrapolation is valid. We find that landscape-scale patterns are opposite to their analogous patch-scale patterns: for sets of patches with equal total habitat area, species richness and evenness decrease with increasing mean size of the patches comprising that area, even when considering only species of conservation concern.

Whether and how much associations between species are also changing is much less documented. In this study, we quantify changes in large-scale patterns of species associations in bird communities in relation to changes in species composition. We use network approaches to build three community-aggregated indices reflecting complementary aspects of species association networks. We characterise the spatio–temporal dynamics of these indices using a large-scale and high-resolution dataset of bird co-abundances of 109 species monitored for 17 years (2001–2017) from 1969 sites across France. We finally test whether spatial and temporal changes in species association networks are related to species homogenisation estimated as the spatio–temporal dynamics of species turnover (β-diversity) and community generalism (community generalisation index). The consistency of these relationships is tested across three main habitats, namely woodland, grassland and human settlements. We document a directional change in association-based indices in response to modifications in species turnover and community generalism in space and time. Weaker associations and sparser networks were related to lower spatial species turnover and higher community generalism, suggesting an overlooked aspect of biotic homogenisation affecting species associations and may also have an impact on species interactions. We report that this overall pattern is not constant across habitats, with opposite relationships between biotic homogenisation and change in species association networks in urban versus forest communities suggesting distinct homogenisation processes. Although species associations contain only partial signatures of species interactions, our study highlights that biotic homogenisation translates to finer changes in community structure by affecting the number, strength and type of species associations.},

	abstract = {Most resource subsidies are temporally variable, dynamically affecting the consumer populations, community structures and ecosystem functions of recipient ecosystems. Temporally variable resource subsidies are characterized by the duration, magnitude, timing and frequency of resource subsidy inputs. These different characteristics may have different mechanisms by which to affect recipient ecosystems. Few studies have examined the duration of resource subsidy inputs on recipient ecosystems, although there exist previous studies focusing on magnitude, timing and frequency. We provide the first experimental test of the effects of subsidy duration on a stream ecosystem by using an outdoor mesocosm experiment, in which we directly manipulated the subsidy duration (pulsed vs. prolonged) of terrestrial invertebrate input into the mesocosm. Given the same overall amount of terrestrial invertebrate subsidy was added, a prolonged subsidy allowed large-stage fish to effectively monopolize the subsidy over small-stage fish, which led small-stage fish to maintain their predation pressure on in-situ prey, that is, benthic invertebrates. On the other hand, a pulsed subsidy allowed small-stage fish to increase their feeding rate of the subsidy and to become away from foraging in-situ prey. Consequently, weaker indirect positive effects on in-situ benthic prey and leaf break-down rate were found with the prolonged versus pulsed subsidy. However, these indirect effects varied by the dominant benthic prey species, which differed in edibility for fish. Such predator-specific vulnerability of benthic prey can be important in mediating trophic cascades in detritus-based stream food webs. Phenological events that generate temporal subsidies (e.g. salmon spawning run and arthropod emergence) can be synchronized (pulsed) or desynchronized (prolonged) within and among species, depending on the degree of spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity. The effects of subsidy duration would thus be important to better understand ecological processes in spatially and temporally coupled ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Our ability to understand population spread dynamics is complicated by rapid evolution, which renders simple ecological models insufficient. If dispersal ability evolves, more highly dispersive individuals may arrive at the population edge than less dispersive individuals (spatial sorting), accelerating spread. If individuals at the low-density population edge benefit (escape competition), high dispersers have a selective advantage (spatial selection). These two processes are often described as forming a positive feedback loop; they reinforce each other, leading to faster spread. Although spatial sorting is close to universal, this form of spatial selection is not: low densities can be detrimental for organisms with Allee effects. Here, we present two conceptual models to explore the feedback loops that form between spatial sorting and spatial selection. We show that the presence of an Allee effect can reverse the positive feedback loop between spatial sorting and spatial selection, creating a negative feedback loop that slows population spread.},

Therefore, understanding the ecological mechanisms underlying these extreme events is crucial. We evaluated theoretical predictions on the size scaling and variance of extreme population abundance by combining (i) the generalized extreme value (GEV) theory and (ii) the resource-limited metabolic restriction hypothesis for population abundance. Using the phytoplankton data from the L4 station in the English Channel, we showed a negative size scaling of the expected value of maximal density, whose confidence interval included the predicted metabolic scaling (α = −1) supporting theoretical predictions. The role of resources and temperature in the distribution of the size–abundance pattern and residuals was well characterized by the GEV distribution. This comprehensive modelling framework will allow to elucidate community structure and fluctuations and provide unbiased return times estimates, thereby improving the prediction accuracy of the timing of the population outbreaks.},

The overarching goal of this work was to determine the role of these dimensions of biodiversity independently and/or interactively in explaining carbon processing in rivers. Here, we explicitly link community structure and subsequent traits of riparian forests to adjacent ecosystem processing of carbon (e.g. leaf litter). This was accomplished by examining how forests are actually structured in addition to experimental manipulations of phylogenetic and functional diversities of riparian forest community inputs of leaf litter to streams. Experimental field manipulations were carried out in three Piedmont headwater streams to answer the following questions: 1) does existing variation in taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of riparian communities differentially drive decomposition in rivers? And 2) independent of taxonomic diversity, how does functional and phylogenetic diversity of leaf litter assemblages influence rates of decomposition in rivers? We observed significant interspecific variation in breakdown among 30 riparian tree species, in addition to significant relationships between breakdown rate and important foliar tissue chemistries. Breakdown of mixtures that reflected the composition of the riparian species composition did not vary with functional nor phylogenetic diversity, but breakdown of litter mixtures was higher than that of single species. In a separate study, when manipulated independently, functional and phylogenetic diversity were positively related to breakdown, and explained similar degrees of variation. These results are important to understand in light of deepening knowledge of the role different dimensions of biodiversity take in explaining ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {Flowering plants emit complex bouquets of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to mediate interactions with their pollinators. These bouquets are undoubtedly influenced by pollinator-mediated selection, particularly in deceptively-pollinated species that rely on chemical mimicry. However, many uncertainties remain regarding how spatially and temporally heterogeneous pollinators affect the diversity and distribution of floral odour variation. Here, we characterized and compared the floral odours of ten populations of deceptively-pollinated Arum maculatum (Araceae), and inter-annual and decadal variation in pollinator attraction within these populations. Additionally, we transplanted individuals from all sampled populations to two common garden sites dominated by different pollinator species (Psychoda phalaenoides or Psycha grisescens), and compared pollinator attraction rates to investigate whether populations maintained odour blends adapted to a specific pollinator. We identified high within- and among-population variation in a common blend of VOCs found across the range of A. maculatum. We also observed shifts in pollinator community composition within several populations over 1–2 years, as well as over the past decade. Common garden experiments further revealed that transplanted inflorescences generally attracted the dominant local pollinator species in both transplant sites. However, one population (Forêt du Gâvre, France) appears to exclusively attract P. grisescens, even when transplanted to a P. phalaenoides-dominated site. Together, our results suggest that maintaining diverse floral odour bouquets within populations may be advantageous when pollinator communities vary over short timescales. We propose that temporally-replicated ecological data are one potential key to understanding variation in complex traits such as floral odour, and in some cases may reveal resiliency to shifting pollinator communities.},

Generally, negative interspecific interactions (such as competition and natural enemies) are more often studied in the context of movement than positive interactions (mutualism). Mutualistic relationships are incredibly common, yet only a subset are studied in the context of movement (transportation mutualisms). Overall, the costs and benefits that an individual experiences are shaped both by their movement behavior and their mutualistic relationships, as well as the intersection between these. Here we argue that the intersection between movement behavior and mutualistic relationships is understudied, and we present a conceptual framework to synthesize the links between movement and mutualisms and give examples of species that exhibit each. Our framework serves both to highlight the ways that mutualism can shape movement (and vice versa) and to draw parallels across different organisms (enabling a more abstract perspective of these biological systems, complementing the system-focused perspective). Finally, we show how considering movement in light of mutualisms (and vice versa) presents a number of new research questions to be answered by each empirical and theoretical approach going forward.},

We analysed the effects of experimental manipulations of nutrient supply and herbivore density on species richness across a range of scales (0.01–75 m2) at 30 grasslands in 10 countries. We found that nutrient addition reduced the number of species that could co-occur locally, indicated by the SAR intercepts (log c), but did not affect the SAR slopes (z).

	abstract = {Ecosystem engineers modify habitats in ways that facilitate other community members by ameliorating harsh conditions. The strength of such facilitation is predicted to be influenced by both beneficiary traits and abiotic context. One key trait of animals that could control the strength of facilitation is beneficiary body size because it should determine how beneficiaries fit within and exploit stress ameliorating habitat modifications. However, few studies have measured how beneficiary body size relates to facilitation strength along environmental gradients. We examined how the strength of facilitation by net-spinning caddisflies on invertebrate communities in streams varied along an elevation gradient and based on traits of the invertebrate beneficiaries. We measured whether use of silk retreats as habitat concentrated invertebrate density and biomass compared to surrounding rock surface habitat and whether the use of retreat habitat varied across body sizes of community members along the gradient. We found that retreats substantially concentrated the densities of a diversity of taxa including eight different Orders, and this effect was greatest at high elevations. Caddisfly retreats also concentrated invertebrate biomass more as elevation increased. Body size of invertebrates inhabiting retreats was lower than that of surrounding rock habitats at low elevation sites, however, body size between retreats and rocks converged at higher elevation sites. Additionally, the body size of invertebrates found in retreats varied within and across taxa. Specifically, caddisfly retreats functioned as a potential nursery for taxa with large maximal body sizes. However, the patterns of this taxon-specific nursery effect were not influenced by elevation unlike the patterns observed based on community-level body size. Collectively, our results indicate that invertebrates use retreats in earlier life stages or when they are smaller in body size independent of life stage. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that facilitation strength intensifies as elevation increases within stream invertebrate communities. Further consideration of how trait variation and environmental gradients interact to determine the strength and direction of biotic interactions will be important as species ranges and environmental conditions continue to shift.},

These selective agents can have both direct and indirect effects. For example, climate might not only influence phenotypic selection on flowering time directly by affecting plant physiology, but it can also alter selection indirectly by modifying the seasonal activity and relative timing of animals interacting with plants. We used 21 yr of data to identify the drivers of selection on flowering time in the perennial herb Lathyrus vernus, and to examine if antagonistic plant–animal interactions mediate effects of climate on selection. We examined the fitness consequences of vertebrate grazing and predispersal seed predation, and how these effects varied among years and among individuals within years. Although both antagonistic plant–animal interactions had important negative effects on plant fitness, only grazing intensity was consistently related to plant phenology, being higher in early-flowering individuals. Spring temperature influenced the intensity of both plant–animal interactions, as well as the covariance between seed predation and plant phenology. However, only differences in grazing intensity among years were associated with differences in selection on flowering time; the strength of selection for early flowering being stronger in years with lower mean intensity of grazing. Our results illustrate how climatic conditions can influence plant–animal interactions that are important selective agents for plant traits. A broader implication of our findings is that both ecological and evolutionary responses to climatic changes might be indirect, and largely mediated by species interactions.},

Although the negative effects of local biodiversity (α diversity) loss on ecosystem stability are well documented, the consequences of biodiversity changes at larger spatial scales, in particular biotic homogenization, that is, reduced species turnover across space (β diversity), remain poorly known. Using data from 39 grassland biodiversity experiments, we examine the effects of β diversity on the stability of simulated landscapes while controlling for potentially confounding biotic and abiotic factors. Our results show that higher β diversity generates more asynchronous dynamics among local communities and thereby contributes to the stability of ecosystem productivity at larger spatial scales. We further quantify the relative contributions of α and β diversity to ecosystem stability and find a relatively stronger effect of α diversity, possibly due to the limited spatial scale of our experiments. The stabilizing effects of both α and β diversity lead to a positive diversity–stability relationship at the landscape scale. Our findings demonstrate the destabilizing effect of biotic homogenization and suggest that biodiversity should be conserved at multiple spatial scales to maintain the stability of ecosystem functions and services.},

Here we derive analytical models for β-diversity to address the debate, clarify the interpretation and extend the application to occurrence data. The analytical analyses show unambiguously that the standardized β-deviation is a quantification of the effect size of non-random spatial distribution of species on β-diversity for a given species abundance distribution. It robustly scales with sampling effort following a power law with exponent of 0.5. This scaling relationship offers a simple method for comparing β-diversity of communities of different sizes. Assuming log-series distribution for the metacommunity species abundance distribution, our model allows for calculation of the standardized β-deviation using occurrence data plus a datum on the total abundance. Our theoretical model justifies and generalizes the use of the β null model for inferring community assembly rules.},

Our results not only support the previous theory that the species diffusing at a slower rate prevails in heterogeneous environments but also reveal that moderate levels of a directed movement component on top of the diffusive movement allow species to coexist.

For this purpose, we explored the sources of variation in the strength of latitudinal changes in herbivory, carnivory and parasitism (119 publications) and compared these gradients with gradients in the diversity of the respective groups of animals (102 publications). Overall, both herbivory and carnivory decreased towards the poles, while parasitism increased. The latitudinal gradient in herbivory and carnivory was threefold stronger above 50–60° than at lower latitudes and was significant due to interactions involving ectothermic consumers, studies using standardised prey (i.e. prey lacking local anti-predator adaptations) and studies aimed at testing LBIH. The poleward decrease in biodiversity did not differ between ectothermic and endothermic animals or among climate zones and was fourfold stronger than decrease in herbivory and carnivory. The discovered differences between the gradients in biotic interactions and biodiversity suggest that these two global macroecological patterns are likely shaped by different factors.},

For these same parameter values, the system is interactive: the existence of a particular species may effect the presence of another. Different parameter values would lead to a noninteractive system.},

	abstract = {(1) The importance of niche overlap between parasitoids in the single or multiple introduction problem in biological control is exhibited by mathematical analysis of one host-two parasitoid systems. (2) The model studies on host-parasitoid systems are briefly reviewed. It is clarified that the one host-two parasitoid models so far presented cover only a special case with respect to niche overlap between parasitoids, and that this is the reason multiple introduction has been supported. (3) Spatial heterogeneity of the host habitat is treated as heterogeneous likelihood of hosts being attacked by parasitoids. This idea provides basis for consideration on niche overlap of parasitoids. (4) To model the case where two parasitoid species show aggregative response (niches of two parasitoids completely overlap), the negative polynomial model is proposed. The analysis concludes that single introduction is always superior. (5) Another new model that can cover various situations of niche overlap of parasitoids (niche overlap model) is proposed to show that single introduction is much more superior if the niches of two parasitoids overlap to a large extent. (6) We also proposed a useful graphical method to determine the superior strategy (single or multiple introduction) in mathematical analysis of the one host-multiparasitoid systems.},

Larvae were reared in artificial pond to measure simultaneously the effects of pond-drying regime, food level, and initial density on growth and fecundity of paedomorphic Ambystoma talpoideum. Pond-drying regime, initial density, and the drying regime x food level interaction affected early larval growth. Early larval growth was highly positively correlated with adult body size. Drying regime, food level, and initial density all significantly affected the number of ova paedomorphic females contained. The number of ova was positively correlated with body size. Removing the effects of snout-vent length by analysis of covariance revealed that variation in the number of ova was largely (84\%) due to the effects of body size. Larvae grew fastest, attained the largest body size, and contained the most ova in constant water, high food, and low-density ponds. The results of this experiment demonstrate a direct relationship between phenotypic variation generated in the larval stage and adult fitness. These results suggest that the larval environment strongly affects the fecundity of adult salamanders at first reproduction and imply that behaviors influencing the selection of oviposition sites by parents can dramatically affect the ultimate reproductive fitness of the next generation.},

These are then invaded with randomly constructed invaders drawn from the same distribution as the residents. The invasion success rate and the fate of the residents are determined as a function of community-and species-level properties. I show that the probability of colonization success for an invader decreases with community size and the average strength of competition (α). Communities composed of many strongly interacting species limit the invasion possibilities of most similar species. These communities, even for a superior invading competitor, set up a sort of "activation barrier" that repels invaders when they invade at low numbers. This "priority effect" for residents is not assumed a priori in my description for the individual population dynamics of these species; rather it emerges because species-rich and strongly interacting species sets have alternative stable states that tend to disfavor species at low densities. These models point to community-level rather than invader-level properties as the strongest determinant of differences in invasion success. The probability of extinction for a resident species increases with community size, and the probability of successful colonization by the invader decreases. Thus an equilibrium community size results wherein the probability of a resident species' extinction just balances the probability of an invader's addition. Given the distribution of α it is now possible to predict the equilibrium species number. The results provide a logical framework for an island-biogeographic theory in which species turnover is low even in the face of persistent invasions and for the protection of fragile native species from invading exotics.},

It is shown that while the increasing patchiness of distribution has a pronounced effect of promoting the intraspecific competition and lowering the equilibrium density for individual populations, it generally relaxes the interspecific competition, making it easy for different species sharing the same niche, which would otherwise be incompatible, to coexist stably. These models thus provide a simplest theoretical basis to explain why many insect populations in nature are kept relatively rare in number and why a number of allied species often coexist freely sharing the same resource, against the “competitive exclusion principle” deduced from the originalVolterra equations.},

Numerous mechanisms and processes are capable of producing both temporary and nonrecoverable differences in community structure. They include priority effects, intransitivities, emergent properties (e.g., vulnerability to invasion, specific topologies), and effects specific to differences in assembly sequences themselves. In ecological systems, the existence of alternative states presents a difficult comparative problem in the search for unifying principles that might underlie community-level organization. This problem can be solved only if we understand the cause of alternative states and determine whether such states are persistent or transient. Otherwise, ecological communities appear so variable that general principles and mechanisms elude detection, even if they exert a powerful influence over the structure of the system. Mechanisms that are documented as controlling community organization and the population dynamics of component species are not necessarily the mechanisms responsible for observed patterns. Factors uncovered in any extant community may be responsible only for maintaining the status quo. The reason these factors (e.g., competition, predation, parasitism) are currently operating is often a direct function of community-assembly mechanics. Community-assembly processes and dynamics must be understood if we are to discern properly between maintenance and causal mechanisms.},

Sedimentation is a relatively permanent retention mechanism whereby particulates and associated contaminants are physically deposited on the wetland soil surface. Plant uptake and litter decomposition provide short- to long-term retention of nutrients, depending on rates of leaching, translocation to and from storage structures, and the longevity of plant tissues. Plant litter can also provide a substrate for microbial processing of nutrients. Wetland soils sorb nutrients, and provide the environment for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms that process nutrients. Wetland storage compartments, fluxes, and net retention rates are discussed for nitrogen and phosphorus.},

	abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an 'observer' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

	abstract = {By 1974, the Mauritius Kestrel Falco punctatus had declined to only four known wild birds, including one breeding pair, as a result of habitat loss and pesticide contamination. A conservation project begun in 1973 has used many management techniques including captive breeding, supplemental feeding of wild birds, provision of nestboxes, multiple clutching, egg pulling, artificial incubation, hand rearing and release of captive-bred and captive-reared birds by hacking, fostering and predator control. A total of 331 kestrels were released in the 10 years up to the end of the 1993–1994 breeding season; one-third of these were captive bred, the rest were derived from eggs harvested from the wild. About 257 (78\%) released birds survived to independence and 61\% of independent juveniles survived their first winter. Although at least 71\% of ringed birds attempted to breed in their first year, only 38\% of the nests of first-year females successfully fledged young, averaging 1.7 per successful nest. Older females fledged young from 64\% of nests, fledging an average of 2.0 per successful nest. The breeding success of hacked birds was similar to that of parent-raised kestrels, though the clutches of hacked birds tended to be larger. Annual replacement of birds holding territories averaged 17\% for both sexes. By the 1993–1994 season, an estimated 56–68 pairs had established territories in the wild with a post-breeding population, including floating birds and independent young, of 222–286. Most of the kestrels were in three sub-populations, two of which were derived entirely from released birds. Mauritius Kestrels are relatively sedentary; 89\% of ringed birds found nesting were less than 5 km from their release or Hedging site. Since the pesticides responsible for their decline are no longer used, the number of Mauritius Kestrels should continue to rise through natural recruitment. The distribution of suitable habitat suggests that an eventual population of 500–600 kestrels on Mauritius is possible. Due to its outstanding success, the release programme for the Mauritius Kestrel ended after the 1993–1994 breeding season, though the population will continue to be monitored carefully for at least the next 5 years.},

	abstract = {The use of captive breeding in species recovery has grown enormously in recent years, but without a concurrent growth in appreciation of its limitations. Problems with (1) establishing self-sufficient captive populations, (2) poor success in reintroductions, (3) high costs, (4) domestication, (5) preemption of other recovery techniques, (6) disease outbreaks, and (7) maintaining administrative continuity have all been significant. The technique has often been invoked prematurely and should not normally be employed before a careful field evaluation of costs and benefits of all conservation alternatives has been accomplished and a determination made that captive breeding is essential for species survival. Merely demonstrating that a species' population is declining or has fallen below what may be a minimum viable size does not constitute enough analysis to justify captive breeding as a recovery measure. Captive breeding should be viewed as a last resort in species recovery and not a prophylactic or long-term solution because of the inexorable genetic and phenotypic changes that occur in captive environments. Captive breeding can play a crucial role in recovery of some species for which effective alternatives are unavailable in the short term. However, it should not displace habitat and ecosystem protection nor should it be invoked in the absence of comprehensive efforts to maintain or restore populations in wild habitats. Zoological institutions with captive breeding programs should operate under carefully defined conditions of disease prevention and genetic/behavioral management. More important, these institutions should help preserve biodiversity through their capacities for public education, professional training, research, and support of in situ conservation efforts.},

Using outdoor tanks (1.8 m diameter, 0.4 m depth), we examined possible cascading trophic effects of predation risk by fish (largemouth bass [Micropterus salmoides]) through omnivorous crayfishes (three Orconectes species) on benthic macroinvertebrates and macrophytes. Even in the absence of predation by bass on crayfish, crayfish mortality was 50\% greater in tanks with bass relative to tanks without bass. Consistent with reduced crayfish numbers and reduced feeding by surviving crayfish in the presence of bass, macrophyte cover was lower in the absence of bass. Similarly, abundance of eight of 11 macroinvertebrate taxa was lower (three significantly so) in the absence of bass. Thus, the impact of crayfish on lower trophic levels was reduced by sublethal effects of predatory bass, partly consistent with the trophic cascade model. However, as omnivores, crayfishes directly affected more than one trophic level, detritivorous/herbivorous macroinvertebrates and macrophytes, and thus produced effects inconsistent with the trophic cascade model. Reduced macrophyte grazing by crayfish may therefore be one mechanism by which biomanipulation (addition of predatory fishes) often results in increases in macrophyte abundance, a response usually attributed solely to decreased shading by phytoplankton.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired’ to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

Consistent with previous suggestions(1,6), our results show that weak to intermediate strength links are important in promoting community persistence and stability. Weak links act to dampen oscillations between consumers and resources. This tends to maintain population densities further away from zero, decreasing the statistical chance that a population will become extinct (lower population densities are more prone to such chances). Data on interaction strengths in natural food webs(7-11) indicate that food-web interaction strengths are indeed characterized by many weak interactions and a few strong interactions.},

	abstract = {This paper uses theory and experiments to explore the effects of diversity on stability, productivity, and susceptibility to invasion. A model of resource competition predicts that increases in diversity cause community stability to increase, but population stability to decrease. These opposite effects are, to a great extent, explained by how temporal variances in species abundances scale with mean abundance, and by the differential impact of this scaling on population vs. community stability. Community stability also depends on a negative covariance effect (competitive compensation) and on overyielding (ecosystem productivity increasing with diversity). A long-term study in Minnesota grasslands supports these predictions. Models of competition predict, and field experiments confirm, that greater plant diversity leads to greater primary productivity. This diversity–productivity relationship results both from the greater chance that a more productive species would be present at higher diversity (the sampling effect) and from the better “coverage” of habitat heterogeneity caused by the broader range of species traits in a more diverse community (the niche differentiation effect). Both effects cause more complete utilization of limiting resources at higher diversity, which increases resource retention, further increasing productivity. Finally, lower levels of available limiting resources at higher diversity are predicted to decrease the susceptibility of an ecosystem to invasion, supporting the diversity–invasibility hypothesis. This mechanism provides rules for community assembly and invasion resistance. In total, biodiversity should be added to species composition, disturbance, nutrient supply, and climate as a major controller of population and ecosystem dynamics and structure. By their increasingly great directional impacts on all of these controllers, humans are likely to cause major long-term changes in the functioning of ecosystems worldwide. A better understanding of these ecosystem changes is needed if ecologists are to provide society with the knowledge essential for wise management of the earth and its biological resources.},

	abstract = {This book examines our current understanding of the population dynamics of one kind of interaction - that between insect parasitoids and their hosts. Parasitoids are amongst the most abundant of all animals, and make up about 10\% or more of metazoan species. Almost no insect species escape their attack. Host-parasitoid interactions were first modelled over fifty years ago, but for many years there was little good empirical information on the important factors that affect host and parasitoid populations. The models were very simple, and their predictions rather divorced from the complexity of what was visible in the field. Now, better data is available on many components of host-parasitoid systems, from field observations and laboratory and field experiments, and this allows a much closer correspondence between models and data. In particular, the past twenty years have seen major advances in our understanding of how host-parasitoid interactions are influenced by spatial processes, by age-structure effects, and by competition from additional host and parasitoid species. The result is a body of theory that makes direct contact with real systems in the field, and provides us with a detailed understanding of what underpins a whole area of population dynamics. In this book, Michael P Hassell pulls the theory and field data together to present an elegant illustration of the way in which ecological studies advance.},

	abstract = {After 25 years of sales, glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) is the world's biggest selling and fastest growing agrochemical. Glyphosate has many strengths, particularly its systemicity and ability to control perennial weeds, which have facilitated its role as an essential tool in modern agriculture. Surveys of recent scientific and patent literature point to several key areas of current and future interest in glyphosate and its use. Biotechnology topics have been the most popular, but there is still much interest in the molecule per se, particularly in manufacturing processes. The mode of action and physiology of glyphosate are common subjects. More applied aspects concern the development of formulations with new adjuvants, or mixtures with other herbicides, to enhance performance. An increasing number of papers are reporting on its environmental fate and on agronomic techniques designed to improve the efficiency of application and minimise its environmental impact. Lack of weed resistance is a key feature of glyphosate despite its widespread use. However, differential levels of tolerance between species have led to changes in weed succession. There is a need to develop integrated weed management systems in which glyphosate still plays a key role. Glyphosate is an exceedingly effective herbicide and presents a considerable challenge to the development of new herbicides for sustainable cropping systems and situations in which cost-effective and environmentally considerate weed control is required. © 2000 Society of Chemical Industry},

We tested the assumption of the equilibrium theory of island biogeography that population densities are independent of area by performing a meta-analysis using the linear correlation coefficient, r, as a measure of the effect of area on population density. We fit meta-analyses that used a random-effects model to these data to test for the effects of taxa, habitat, latitude, spatial scale, and overall population density. We also fit meta-analyses that used a fixed-effect model to the same data to estimate the repeatability of measurements of the correlation between population density and area within species. Contrary to the equilibrium theory of island biogeography, our results indicate that, on average, animal population densities are positively correlated with area, which suggests that density compensation may be uncommon. This result was found for individual species, but not for faunas. We found taxonomic differences in the correlation between population density and area, with insects and birds having on average large or moderately large positive correlations, respectively, and mammals having correlations near zero. Observations within individual species showed considerable repeatability. The observed overall positive correlation between the population density of individual animal species and area is best explained in the context of the resource concentration hypothesis. Our results imply that the regional abundance and persistence of animal populations may depend strongly on the presence and continued persistence of a few large patches of suitable habitat, rather than on a regional network of small and large habitat patches.},

We collected replicated and randomized plant data at 11 spatial scales from 0.01 to 108square meters in Great Britain which show that the slope of the log-log plot is not constant, but varies systematically with spatial scale, and from habitat to habitat at the same spatial scale. Values ofz were low (0.1 to 0.2) at small scales ({\textless}100 square meters), high (0.4 to 0.5) at intermediate scales (1 hectare to 10 square kilometers), and low again (0.1 to 0.2) for the largest scale transitions (e.g., East Berks to all of Berkshire). Instead of one process determining changes in species richness across a wide range of scales, different processes might determine plant biodiversity at different spatial scales.},

Theory suggests a counterintuitive consequence of such intraguild predation: enrichment of the shared resource, for which the intraguild prey must be the superior competitor, reduces the population size of the intraguild prey and may even cause its extinction. Experiments with bacteria (shared resource) and the ciliates Tetrahymena (intraguild prey) and Blepharisma (intraguild predator) confirmed these expectations. Tetrahymena was the better resource competitor. Grown separately, it persisted at lower levels of enrichment and drove bacterial densities to lower levels than did Blepharisma. When grown together with Blepharisma, Tetrahymena declined in density with increasing enrichment, whereas bacteria and Blepharisma increased. The data thus support the theoretically suggested mechanism as the cause of this pattern: with enrichment, increasing densities of bacteria sustained an increasing predation pressure from Blepharisma on Tetrahymena, which overrode the direct positive effect of bacteria as a food source of Tetrahymena. Generalizing from these results, we speculate that staggered invasions of omnivores followed by extinctions of intermediate prey should contribute to the frequently observed unimodal or neutral responses of species richness and food chain length to increasing productivity.},

We have labeled them “generalized Horton laws” in contrast to traditional Horton laws which are stated only in terms of means. These data sets also show that Horton's bifurcation ratios are significantly larger than 4, which can not be predicted by the well-known random model. Motivated by the need to understand these data analyses of large river networks within a common theoretical framework, a new class of models with statistically self-similar network topology is introduced. The network construction process can be viewed as a statistical generalization of the type of a recursive process which generates many fractal geometrical objects. Unlike the well-known random model, our random channel networks do not belong to the class of binary Galton-Watson stochastic branching processes. The generalized Horton laws are predicted in the limit of large Horton-Strahler order as a scale parameter for a subclass of random self-similar network models. A derivation of Horton's law of stream numbers as a consequence of the simple scaling of distributions of basin magnitude gives it a new theoretical significance. A further subclass also exhibits Tokunga self-similarity, which is an average property of the side tributary structure in river networks. Comparisons with empirical observations for three large basins analyzed here show that the generalized Horton laws are well predicted by this new class of random self-similar network models, and analytically predicted relationships between topologic and geometric Horton ratios are also seen in data.},

This ambitious book presents a new, general neutral theory to explain the origin, maintenance, and loss of biodiversity in a biogeographic context. Until now biogeography (the study of the geographic distribution of species) and biodiversity (the study of species richness and relative species abundance) have had largely disjunct intellectual histories. In this book, Stephen Hubbell develops a formal mathematical theory that unifies these two fields. When a speciation process is incorporated into Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson's now classical theory of island biogeography, the generalized theory predicts the existence of a universal, dimensionless biodiversity number. In the theory, this fundamental biodiversity number, together with the migration or dispersal rate, completely determines the steady-state distribution of species richness and relative species abundance on local to large geographic spatial scales and short-term to evolutionary time scales. Although neutral, Hubbell's theory is nevertheless able to generate many nonobvious, testable, and remarkably accurate quantitative predictions about biodiversity and biogeography. In many ways Hubbell's theory is the ecological analog to the neutral theory of genetic drift in genetics. The unified neutral theory of biogeography and biodiversity should stimulate research in new theoretical and empirical directions by ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and biogeographers.},

For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably will have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred. Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change. These interactions represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future biodiversity change.},

In a deciduous forest and stream ecotone, aquatic insect emergence peaked around spring, when terrestrial invertebrate biomass was low. In contrast, terrestrial invertebrate input to the stream occurred primarily during summer, when aquatic invertebrate biomass was nearly at its lowest. Such reciprocal, across-habitat prey flux alternately subsidized both forest birds and stream fishes, accounting for 25.6\% and 44.0\% of the annual total energy budget of the bird and fish assemblages, respectively. Seasonal contrasts between allochthonous prey supply and in situ prey biomass determine the importance of reciprocal subsidies.},

	abstract = {Ecologists increasingly recognize that a consideration of spatial dynamics is essentialfor resolving many classical problems in community ecology. In the present paper, I argue that understanding how trophic interactions influence population stability can have important implications for the expression of spatial processes. I use two examples to illustrate this point. The first example has to do with spatial determinants of food chain length. Prior theoretical and empirical work has suggested that colonization–extinction dynamics can influence food chain length, at least for specialist consumers. I briefly review evidence and prior theory that food chain length is sensitive to area. A metacommunity scenario, in which each of various patches can have a food chain varying in length (but in which a consumer is not present on a patch unless its required resource is also present), shows that alternative landscape states are possible. This possibility arises if top predators moderate unstable interactions between intermediate predators and basal resources. The second example has to do with the impact of recurrent immigration on the stability of persistent populations. Immigration can either stabilize or destabilize local population dynamics. Moreover, an increase in immigration can decrease average population size for unstable populations with direct density-dependence, or in predator–prey systems with saturating functional responses. These theoretical models suggest that the interplay of temporal variation and spatial fluxes can lead to novel qualitative phenomena.},

	abstract = {Conservation biologists often ignore density dependence because at-risk populations are typically small relative to historical levels. However, if populations are reduced as a result of impacts that lower carrying capacity, then density-dependent mortality may exist at low population abundances. Here, we explore this issue in threatened populations of juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We followed the fate of more than 50 000 juvenile chinook in the Snake River Basin, USA to test the hypothesis that their survival was inversely associated with juvenile density. We also tested the hypotheses that non-indigenous brook trout and habitat quality affect the presence or strength of density dependence. Our results indicate that juvenile chinook suffer density-dependent mortality and the strength of density dependence was greater in streams in which brook trout were absent. We were unable to detect an effect of habitat quality on the strength of density dependence. Historical impacts of humans have greatly reduced population sizes of salmon, and the density dependence we report may stem from a shortage of nutrients normally derived from decomposing salmon carcasses. Cohorts of juvenile salmon may experience density-dependent mortality at population sizes far below historical levels and recovery of imperiled populations may be much slower than currently expected.},

For many sessile marine invertebrates high settlement densities can lead to competition with conspecifics that can affect the probability of mortality, morphology, and reproductive output. This work aims to determine the affect of recruit density on shell morphology and fecundity and the temporal nature of intraspecific competition for the acorn barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides. Two tile arrays were used; experiment 1 was deployed at the start of the settlement season (43,264 recruits, 4.1\% survivorship to adult), experiment 2 was deployed in the middle of the season (5,454 recruits, 42.8\% survivorship). Experiment 2 displayed density dependent mortality between recruits and juveniles and adults, whereas no relationship was found for exp. 1. Experiment 2 had higher egg production per individual, but also higher egg production per area of tile compared to exp. 1. A negative relationship was found between recruit density and egg production, however during the summer period, this relationship switched to a positive relationship between juvenile density and egg production, due to high mortality on tiles with high recruit density. Cumulative population density (CPD) was calculated as the cumulative mean density of barnacles per cm-2 of tile and was used as an index of intraspecific competition. There was a linear negative relationship between mass of eggs per individual and CPD. However, CPD over the summer period more fully explained egg production per individual. A time window was identified when cumulative intraspecific competitive effects were shown to have a strong negative effect on egg production and an increase in mortality, causing a flip from density independent fecundity to density dependent fecundity. These results suggest that recruit density is an important driver of subsequent population processes.},

Clearance operations probably favoured the expansion of this vulnerable fish species because of positive associations of bitterling with large and deep ditches that had been cleared in the last 2-3 years and characterized by a small cover of submerged plants.

The increasing trend may be related to the proportions of hatchery and wild smolts entering saltwater, fishing rates, and changes in the ecological processes regulating coho salmon production in the ocean. The consequence for management is that the abundance of wild spawning salmon (escapement) depends on hatchery as well as wild production. The consequence for policy makers is that future enhancement activities need to have clear policies for assessing the effects of hatchery fish on the population dynamics of wild fish as well as for producing hatchery fish.},

	abstract = {Habitat alteration and biotic invasions are the two leading causes of global environmental change and biodiversity loss. Recent innovative experiments have shown that habitat disturbance can have drastic effects that cascade to adjacent ecosystems by altering the flow of resource subsidies from donor systems. Likewise, exotic species invasions could alter subsidies and affect distant food webs, but very few studies have tested this experimentally. Here we report evidence from a large-scale field experiment in northern Japan that invasion of nonnative rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) interrupted reciprocal flows of invertebrate prey that drove stream and adjacent riparian forest food webs. Rainbow trout usurped terrestrial prey that fell into the stream, causing native Dolly Varden charr (Salvelinus malma) to shift their foraging to insects that graze algae from the stream bottom. This indirectly increased algal biomass, but also decreased biomass of adult aquatic insects emerging from the stream to the forest. In turn, this led to a 65\% reduction in the density of riparian-specialist spiders in the forest. Thus, species invasions can interrupt flows of resources between interconnected ecosystems and have effects that propagate across their boundaries, effects that may be difficult to anticipate without in-depth understanding of food web relationships.},

Our experiments tested explicit predictions from a model for our system that allows prey evolution(9). We verified the predicted existence of an evolutionary tradeoff between algal competitive ability and defence against consumption, and examined its effects on cycle dynamics by manipulating the evolutionary potential of the prey population. Single-clone algal cultures (lacking genetic variability) produced short cycle periods and typical quarter-period phase lags between prey and predator densities, whereas multi-clonal (genetically variable) algal cultures produced long cycles with prey and predator densities nearly out of phase, exactly as predicted. These results confirm that prey evolution can substantially alter predator-prey dynamics, and therefore that attempts to understand population oscillations in nature(10,11) cannot neglect potential effects from ongoing rapid evolution.},

Moreover, censuses may occur sporadically, and observation errors change with sample methods and effort. The state variable (usually density or abundance) may be hidden from view and known only through highly indirect observational schemes (such as public health records, hunting reports, or fossil/archeological surveys). We extend the basic state-space model for time-series analysis to accommodate these dominant sources of variability that influence population data. Using examples, we show how different types of process error and observation error, unequal sample intervals, and missing values can be accounted for within the flexible framework of Bayesian state-space models. We provide algorithms based on Gibbs sampling that can be used to obtain posterior estimates of population states and of model parameters. For models that can be linearized, results can be used for direct sampling of the posterior, including those with missing values and unequal sample intervals. For nonlinear models, we make use of Metropolis-Hastings within the Gibbs sampling framework. Examples derive from long-term census and population data. We illustrate the extension to discrete state variables with multiple stages using a Time-series Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (TSIR) model for mid 20th-century measles infection in London, where birth rates are assumed known, but susceptibles and infected individuals arise from imperfect reporting.},

The mobility of three particle sizes were measured during simulated flooding and the fraction of particles eroded compared with that of control streams. 4 Larvae increased the initial velocity required to erode sediments by 10–30\%. At velocities sufficient to scour 87\% of particles from control channels, 57–100\% remained stable in channels colonized by larvae. 5 Assuming larvae have similar effects in natural streams, caddisflies could be expected to increase the recurrence interval of a substrate scouring flood from 1·67 year to 2·41 year, corresponding to a 17\% decrease in the probability of bed scour per year. 6 Our study suggests these insects could play an important role in generating the spatial ‘refuges’ that moderate the resistance of lotic communities to flooding. It is argued that, as has occurred in marine systems, a better understanding of how freshwater organisms engineer their physical environment has much potential to complement our historical focus on the abiotic forces that constrain populations and communities.},

Recent studies suggest unifying these theories by demonstrating how spatial patterns influence food-web structure13,14,15,16 and vice versa17. Here, we follow this suggestion by developing and empirically testing a more unified scaling theory. On the basis of power-law species–area relationships, we develop link–area and non-power-law link–species models that accurately predict how trophic links scale with area and species richness of microcosms, lakes and streams from community to metacommunity levels. In contrast to previous models that assume that species richness alone determines the number of trophic links7,8, these models include the species' spatial distribution, and hence extend the domain of complexity theory to metacommunity scales. This generality and predictive success shows how complexity theory and spatial theory can be unified into a much more general theory addressing new domains of ecology.},

	abstract = {Species–energy theory is a commonly invoked theory predicting a positive relationship between species richness and available energy. The More Individuals Hypothesis (MIH) attempts to explain this pattern, and assumes that areas with greater food resources support more individuals, and that communities with more individuals include more species. Using a large dataset for North American birds, I tested these predictions of the MIH, and also examined the effect of habitat complexity on community structure. I found qualitative support for the relationships predicted by the MIH, however, the MIH alone was inadequate for fully explaining richness patterns. Communities in more productive sites had more individuals, but they also had more even relative abundance distributions such that a given number of individuals yielded a greater number of species. Richness and evenness were also higher in structurally complex forests compared to structurally more simple grasslands when controlling for available energy.},

For the most part, these studies are observational in nature and have not shown that alternate states arise from the order of species arrival during community assembly. Previous studies also provide little insight into the mechanisms that create alternate states, especially when direct species interactions, rather than environmental feedback, control their formation. We conducted experiments in identical physical environments to show that differences in the sequence of community assembly can create alternate species compositions that persist for many generations. Assembly sequence determined whether experimental food webs contained a single intraguild predator, or two intraguild predators. When the intraguild predator, Blepharisma americanum, became established in communities before the introduction of Tetrahymena vorax, combined effects of resource depletion and intraguild predation prevented the establishment of Tetrahymena. In contrast, when Tetrahymena preceded Blepharisma, both species frequently coexisted. Supporting experiments describe the exploitative competitive abilities of both intraguild predators, document the population dynamics of each species in less complex community modules, and determine the ability of Tetrahymena to invade Blepharisma cultures in the absence of competing prey. These results show that both competition and predation contribute to the formation of two alternate community states and confirm that one stable state resists transformation to the other.},

In this study, we examined the usefulness of both methods to assess the impact of exotic trout on native charr. 2 Brown trout Salmo trutta and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss have been introduced world-wide. They are invading many streams in Japan that also harbour native salmonids. We studied these species and the endemic Asian white-spotted charr Salvelinus leucomaenis in the Hekirichi River, south-western Hokkaido, Japan. We estimated the densities of all three species in pools and riffles from 27 stream reaches over 2 successive years. Data were analysed by regression and isodar methods to infer interspecific interactions. 3 The regression method identified a negative relationship between brown trout and white-spotted charr densities, implying that brown trout are replacing white-spotted charr. 4 The isodar method identified significant competition for habitat between rainbow trout and white-spotted charr. This method suggested that white-spotted charr preferred pools to riffles when rainbow trout were scarce but moved from pools to riffles as trout density in the pools increased. 5 Synthesis and applications. Although they are based on limited data, regression and isodar methods were able to evaluate the potential impact of exotic trout on native white-spotted charr. From these results, we were able to hypothesize mechanisms of displacement of native charr by exotic trout. However, according to the two methods the mechanisms underlying the negative impacts on charr differ between brown and rainbow trout; in other words, limitations exist for both methods. From a more practical viewpoint, the analyses conducted in this study may be useful tools for conservation biologists who have limitations on their time and effort but must assess the impacts of exotics on native species.},

Stable coexistence requires differences between species which lead to functional complementarity and differences between the yields of mixtures and monocultures. Only a weaker version of functional redundancy, i.e. that mixture yields lie within the range of variation of monoculture yields, is compatible with stable coexistence in Lotka-Volterra systems. Spatial and temporal environmental variability may provide room for functional redundancy at small spatial and temporal scales, but is not expected to do so at the larger scales at which environmental variations help maintain coexistence. Neutral coexistence of equivalent competitors, non-linear per capita growth rates, and lack of correlation between functional impact and biomass may provide the basis for the existence of functional redundancy in natural ecosystems. Overall, there is a striking parallel between the conditions that allow stable coexistence and those that allow overyielding.},

These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

This question has been raised before and resolved in favour of 3/4. Like previous ones, recent claims for a value of 2/3 are based almost entirely on basal metabolic rate (BMR) in mammals. 2 Here we compile and analyse a new, larger data set for mammalian BMR. We show that interspecific variation in BMR, as well as field metabolic rates of mammals, and basal or standard metabolic rates for many other organisms, including vertebrates, invertebrates, protists and plants, all scale with exponents whose confidence intervals include 3/4 and exclude 2/3. Our analysis of maximal metabolic rate gives a slope that is greater than and confidence intervals that exclude both 3/4 and 2/3. 3 Additionally, numerous other physiological rates that are closely tied to metabolism in a wide variety of organisms, including heart and respiratory rates in mammals, scale as M−1/4. 4 The fact that quarter-power allometric scaling is so pervasive in biology suggests that different allometric relations have a common, mechanistic origin and provides an empirical basis for theoretical models that derive these scaling exponents.},

Even when they occur, these strongly interacting chains are accompanied by strong omnivory more often than expected by chance. By using a food web model, we show that these interaction strength combinations reduce the likelihood of trophic cascades after the overfishing of top predators. However, fishing selectively removes predators that are overrepresented in strongly interacting chains. Hence, the potential for strong community-wide effects remains a threat.},

	abstract = {Changes in species composition of communities seem to proceed gradually at first sight, but remarkably rapid shifts are known to occur. Although disrupting disturbances seem an obvious explanation for such shifts, evidence for large disturbances is not always apparent. Here we show that complex communities tend to move through occasional catastrophic shifts in response to gradual environmental change or evolution. This tendency is caused by multiple attractors that may exist in such systems. We show that alternative attractors arise robustly in randomly generated multispecies models, especially if competition is symmetrical and if interspecific competition is allowed to exceed intraspecific competition. Inclusion of predators as a second trophic level did not alter the results greatly, although it reduced the probability of alternative attractors somewhat. These results suggest that alternative attractors may commonly arise from interactions between large numbers of species. Consequently, the response of complex communities to environmental change is expected to be characterized by hysteresis and sudden shifts. Some unexplained regime shifts observed in ecosystems could be related to alternative attractors arising from complex species interactions. Additionally, our results support the idea that ancient mass extinctions may partly be due to an intrinsic loss of stability of species configurations.},

	abstract = {Costs of parasitism are commonly measured by comparing the performance of infected groups of individuals to that of uninfected control groups. This measure potentially underestimates the cost of parasitism because it ignores indirect costs, which may result from the modification of the competitiveness of the hosts by the parasite. In this context, we used the host-parasite system consisting of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti and the microsporidian parasite Vavraia culicis to address this question: Do infected individuals exert a more or less intense intraspecific competition than uninfected individuals? Our experimental results show that, indeed, infected hosts incur a direct cost of parasitism: It takes them longer to become adults than uninfected individuals. They also incur an indirect cost, however, which is actually larger than the direct cost: When grown in competition with uninfected individuals they develop even slower. The consequence of this modification of competitiveness is that, in our system, the cost of parasitism is underestimated by the traditional measure. Moreover, because the indirect cost depends on the frequency of interactions between infected and uninfected individuals, our results suggest that the real cost of parasitism, i.e., virulence, is negatively correlated with the prevalence of the parasite. This link between prevalence and virulence may have dynamical consequences, such as reducing the invasion threshold of the parasite, and evolutionary consequences, such as creating a selection pressure maintaining the host's constitutive resistance to the parasite.},

However, it was never advertised as vigorously as Stephen Hubbell did in the context of his neutral community theory. After his book appeared in 2001, several scientists have sought and found analytical expressions for the effect of dispersal limitation on community composition, still in the neutral context. This has been done along two relatively independent lines of research that have a different mathematical approach and focus on different, yet related, types of results. Here, we study both types in a new framework that makes use of the sampling nature of the theory. We present sampling distributions that contain binomial or hypergeometric sampling on the one hand, and dispersal limitation on the other, and thus views dispersal limitation as ubiquitous as sampling effects. Further, we express the results of one line of research in terms of the other and vice versa, using the concept of subsamples. A consequence of our findings is that metacommunity size does not independently affect the outcome of neutral models in contrast to a previous assertion (Ecol. Lett., 7, 2004, p. 904) based on an incorrect formula (Phys. Rev. E, 68, 2003, p. 061902, eqns 11–14).

Three kinds of dynamic models were used to estimate allochthony: a process-rich, dual-isotope flow model based on mass balances of two carbon isotopes in 12 carbon pools; simple univariate time-series models driven by observed time courses of δ13CO2; and multivariate autoregression models that combined information from time series of δ13C in several interacting carbon pools. All three models gave similar estimates of allochthony. In the three experiments without nutrient enrichment, flows of terrestrial carbon to dissolved and particulate organic carbon, zooplankton, Chaoborus, and fishes were substantial. For example, terrestrial sources accounted for more than half the carbon flow to juvenile and adult largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiners, brook sticklebacks, and fathead minnows in the unenriched experiments. Allochthony was highest in the dystrophic lake and lowest in the nutrient-enriched lake. Nutrient enrichment of Peter Lake decreased allochthony of zooplankton from 0.34–0.48 to 0–0.12, and of fishes from 0.51–0.80 to 0.25–0.55. These experiments show that lake ecosystem carbon cycles, including carbon flows to consumers, are heavily subsidized by organic carbon from the surrounding landscape.},

	abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950–2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/30033811},
	abstract = {Understanding and predicting the dynamics of multispecies systems generally require estimates of interaction strength among species. Measuring interaction strength is difficult because of the large number of interactions in any natural system, long-term feedback, multiple pathways of effects between species pairs, and possible nonlinearities in interaction-strength functions. Presently, the few studies that extensively estimate interaction strength suggest that distributions of interaction strength tend to be skewed toward few strong and many weak interactions. Modeling studies indicate that such skewed patterns tend to promote system stability and arise during assembly of persistent communities. Methods for estimating interaction strength efficiently from traits of organisms, such as allometric relationships, show some promise. Methods for estimating community response to environmental perturbations without an estimate of interaction strength may also be of use. Spatial and temporal scale may affect patterns of interaction strength, but these effects require further investigation and new multispecies modeling frameworks. Future progress will be aided by development of long-term multispecies time series of natural communities, by experimental tests of different methods for estimating interaction strength, and by increased understanding of nonlinear functional forms.},

	abstract = {We evaluated the roles of the abiotic environment and dispersal in the assembly of fern communities at contrasting spatial scales within an old-growth, temperate deciduous forest. Specifically, we examined correlations among the geographic location of sampling plots separated by either 135–3515 m (mesoscale) or 4–134 m (fine scale), the abiotic environmental characteristics of the plots, and their constituent fern species. Ferns had predictable distributions along a soil moisture gradient at both spatial scales: six of eight common fern species showed repeatable environmental optima along the soil moisture gradient. By sampling in such a way as to decouple the correlation between distance and environmental variation, we showed the dominant role of environmental variables such as soil moisture in determining fern distributions at the mesoscale. At the fine scale, however, strong spatial autocorrelation in the abiotic environment precluded assigning any definitive role for either dispersal or environmental determinism alone in affecting fern distributions. The expectations of neutral theory that are rooted in dispersal limitation and those of niche theory that are rooted in environmental adaptation converge at fine spatial scales where natural environments have strong spatial structure. The structure of the environment at fine spatial scales may foster the persistence of dispersal-limited plants in the community; neighboring environments are likely to be similar, and thus suitable for propagules dispersing short distances. While patterns of fern distribution in this locality are not consistent with purely neutral or random models of species coexistence, alternative models that rely on strict niche requirements without accounting for dispersal effects and the inherent spatial structure of the environment are inadequate because they neglect the important interaction of these factors. This outcome supports the relevance of developing theory that considers the joint effects of environmental determinism and dispersal on the distribution and abundance of plant species.},

	abstract = {Density-dependent dispersal can be caused by various mechanisms, from competition inducing individuals to emigrate (positive density-dependence) to social crowding effects impeding free movement (negative density-dependence). Various spatial population models have incorporated positively density-dependent dispersal algorithms, and recent theoretical models have explored the conditions for density-dependent dispersal (DD) to evolve. However, while the existence of DD is well documented in some taxa such as insects, there is no clear picture on its generality in vertebrates. Here I review the available empirical data on DD in birds and mammals, focusing mainly on variation in dispersal between years and on experimental density manipulations. Surprisingly few studies have explicitly focused on DD, and interpretation of the available data is often hampered by differences in approach, small sample sizes and/or statistical shortcomings. Positive DD was reported in 50 and 33\% of the selected mammal and bird studies, respectively, while two studies on mammals (out of eight) reported negative DD. Among bird studies, DD was more often reported for emigration rates or long-distance recoveries than for average distances within finite study areas. Experimental studies manipulating densities (mainly on mammals) have consistently generated positive DD, typically showing reduced emigration in response to partial population removal. Studies that examined dispersal in relation to seasonal changes in density (small mammals only) have more often reported negative DD. Studies that compared dispersal between sites differing in density, also show a mixture of positive and negative DD. This suggests that dispersal changes in a more complex way with seasonal and spatial density variation than with annual densities, and/or that these results are confounded by other factors differing between seasons and sites, such as habitat quality. I conclude that both correlational and experimental studies support the existence of positive, rather than negative, density-dependent dispersal in birds and mammals.},

	abstract = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action -‘Water for Life’ - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01\% of the World's water and approximately 0.8 \% of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100 000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6\% of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the ‘Water for Life’ decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as ‘receivers’ of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed ‘reconciliation ecology’.},

	abstract = {The neutral model posits that random variation in extinction and speciation events, coupled with limited dispersal, can account for many community properties, including the relative abundance distribution. There are important analogies between this model in ecology and a three-tiered hierarchy of models in evolution (Hardy Weinburg, drift, drift and selection). Because it invokes random processes and is used in statistical tests of empirical data, the neutral model can be interpreted as a specialized form of a null model. However, the application and interpretation of neutral models differs from that of standard null models in three important ways: 1) whereas most null models incorporate species-level constraints that are often associated with niche differences, the neutral model assumes that all species are functionally equivalent. 2) Null models are usually fit with constraints that are measured directly from the data set itself. In contrast, the neutral model requires parameters for speciation, extinction, and migration rates that are almost never measured directly, so their values must be guessed at or fitted. 3) Most important, null models are viewed as simple statistical descriptors: unspecified “random” forces generate variation in a simple model that excludes particular biological mechanisms (usually species interactions). Although the neutral model was originally framed as a null model, recent proponents of the neutral model have begun to treat it as a literal process-based description of community assembly. These differences lie at the heart of much of the recent controversy over the neutral model. If the neutral model is truly a process-based model, then its assumptions should be directly tested, and its predictions should be compared to those of an appropriate null model. Such tests are rarely informative, and most empirical data sets can be fit more parsimoniously to a simple log-normal distribution. Because unknown parameters in the neutral model must usually be guessed at or fit in ad-hoc ways, classical frequentist tests are compromised, and may be biased towards finding a good fit with the model. There has been little analysis of the potential for type I and type II errors in statistical tests of the neutral model. The neutral model has recently been proposed as a specific form of more general null models in biogeography (the mid-domain effect) and community ecology (species co-occurrence). In both cases, the neutral model is qualitatively, but not quantitatively, similar to the predictions of classic null models. However, because the important parameters in the neutral model can rarely be measured directly, it may be of limited value as a null hypothesis for empirical tests. Future progress may come from moving beyond dichotomous tests of neutral versus null models. Instead, the neutral model might be viewed as a mechanism that contributes to pattern along with other processes. Alternatively, the fit of data to the neutral model can be compared to the fit to other process-based models that are not based on neutrality assumptions. Finally, the neutral model can also be tested directly if its parameters can be estimated independently of the test data. However, these approaches may require more data than are often available. For these reasons, simple null model tests will continue to be important in the evaluation of the neutral model.},

To do this, we used four case studies of the red sea bream Pagrus major and the Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus to establish whether hatchery releases augmented total production without replacement of wild fish. The catches by age of released and wild fish showed that hatchery-reared fish contributed 36.4±17.8\% to total production of red sea bream and 22.6±11.3\% to flounder, respectively. About 50\% of the variation in total catches was explained by capture of hatchery-reared fish for red sea bream, and 29–38\% for flounder. However, the scope for increased production was limited by carrying capacity, particularly at release sites. Replacement of wild fish by hatchery-reared juveniles was suggested in one case. The comparative analysis of macro-scale catch history revealed that the average contribution of hatchery-reared fish was 9.5\% for red sea bream and 11.7\% for flounder, and the global dynamics of wild populations does not appear to be linked to stock enhancement activities. Our results suggest the need for a cautious approach to stock enhancement programmes. We also address the biological potential, the limitations, and the future prospects of marine stock enhancement.},

In the other versions, we randomize the observed network of interactions using two different null models. We show that the community response to habitat loss is affected by network structure. Real communities start to decay sooner than random communities, but persist for higher destruction levels. There is a destruction threshold at which the community collapses. Our model is the first attempt to describe the dynamics of whole mutualistic metacommunities interacting in realistic ways.},

New studies increasingly document how species and community shifts influence ecosystem processes.

Here we show that self-organized clusters of look-a-likes may emerge spontaneously from coevolution of competitors. The explanation is that there are two alternative ways to survive together: being sufficiently different or being sufficiently similar. Using a model based on classical competition theory, we demonstrate a tendency for evolutionary emergence of regularly spaced lumps of similar species along a niche axis. Indeed, such lumpy patterns are commonly observed in size distributions of organisms ranging from algae, zooplankton, and beetles to birds and mammals, and could not be well explained by earlier theory. Our results suggest that these patterns may represent self-constructed niches emerging from competitive interactions. A corollary of our findings is that, whereas in species-poor communities sympatric speciation and invasion of open niches is possible, species-saturated communities may be characterized by convergent evolution and invasion by look-a-likes.},

	abstract = {Aim There is a debate as to whether biotic interactions exert a dominant role in governing species distributions at macroecological scales. The prevailing idea is that climate is the key limiting factor; thus models that use present-day climate–species range relationships are expected to provide reasonable means to quantify the impacts of climate change on species distributions. However, there is little empirical evidence that biotic interactions would not constrain species distributions at macroecological scales. We examine this idea, for the first time, and provide tests for two null hypotheses: (H0 1) – biotic interactions do not exert a significant role in explaining current distributions of a particular species of butterfly (clouded Apollo, Parnassius mnemosyne) in Europe; and (H0 2) – biotic interactions do not exert a significant role in predictions of altered species’ ranges under climate change. Location Europe. Methods Generalized additive modelling (GAM) was used to investigate relationships between species and climate; species and host plants; and species and climate + host plants. Because models are sensitive to the variable selection strategies utilised, four alternative approaches were used: AIC (Akaike's Information Criterion), BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), BRUTO (Adaptive Backfitting), and CROSS (Cross Selection). Results In spite of the variation in the variables selected with different methods, both hypotheses (H0 1 and H0 2) were falsified, providing support for the proposition that biotic interactions significantly affect both the explanatory and predictive power of bioclimatic envelope models at macro scales. Main conclusions Our results contradict the widely held view that the effects of biotic interactions on individual species distributions are not discernible at macroecological scales. Results are contingent on the species, type of interaction and methods considered, but they call for more stringent evidence in support of the idea that purely climate-based modelling would be sufficient to quantify the impacts of climate change on species distributions.},

Here, I develop the hypothesis that the relative importance of stochastic ecological drift and/or priority effects depend on the harshness of the ecological filter in those habitats. I established long-term experimental ponds to explore the relative importance of community assembly history and drought on patterns of community compositional similarity among ponds that were otherwise similar in their environmental conditions. I show considerable site-to-site variation in pond community composition in the absence of drought that likely resulted from a combination of stochastic ecological drift and priority effects. However, in ponds that experienced drought, I found much higher similarity among communities that likely resulted from niche-selection filtering out species from the regional pool that could not tolerate such environmental harshness. These results implicate the critical role for understanding the processes of community assembly when examining patterns of biodiversity at different spatial scales.},

	abstract = {In a predictive model, what is the expected difference in the outcome associated with a unit difference in one of the inputs? In a linear regression model without interactions, this average predictive comparison is simply a regression coefficient (with associated uncertainty). In a model with nonlinearity or interactions, however, the average predictive comparison in general depends on the values of the predictors. We consider various definitions based on averages over a population distribution of the predictors, and we compute standard errors based on uncertainty in model parameters. We illustrate with a study of criminal justice data for urban counties in the United States. The outcome of interest measures whether a convicted felon received a prison sentence rather than a jail or non-custodial sentence, with predictors available at both individual and county levels. We fit three models: (1) a hierarchical logistic regression with varying coefficients for the within-county intercepts as well as for each individual predictor; (2) a hierarchical model with varying intercepts only; and (3) a nonhierarchical model that ignores the multilevel nature of the data. The regression coefficients have different interpretations for the different models; in contrast, the models can be compared directly using predictive comparisons. Furthermore, predictive comparisons clarify the interplay between the individual and county predictors for the hierarchical models and also illustrate the relative size of varying county effects.},

Here we show that the order and timing of immigration controls the extent of diversification. When an ancestral bacterial genotype was introduced into a spatially structured habitat, it rapidly diversified into multiple niche-specialist types(5). However, diversification was suppressed when a niche-specialist type was introduced before, or shortly after, introduction of the ancestral genotype. In contrast, little suppression occurred when the same niche specialist was introduced relatively late. The negative impact of early arriving immigrants was attributable to the historically sensitive outcome of interactions involving neutral competition(3) and indirect facilitation. Ultimately, the entire boom-and-bust dynamics of adaptive radiation were altered. These results demonstrate that immigration and diversification are tightly linked processes, with small differences in immigration history greatly affecting the evolutionary emergence of diversity.},

Recent syntheses outline potential applications of network theory to ecological systems, but do not address the implications of physical structure for network dynamics. There is a specific need to examine how dendritic habitat structure, such as that found in stream, hedgerow and cave networks, influences ecological processes. Although dendritic networks are one type of ecological network, they are distinguished by two fundamental characteristics: (1) both the branches and the nodes serve as habitat, and (2) the specific spatial arrangement and hierarchical organization of these elements interacts with a species' movement behaviour to alter patterns of population distribution and abundance, and community interactions. Here, we summarize existing theory relating to ecological dynamics in dendritic networks, review empirical studies examining the population- and community-level consequences of these networks, and suggest future research integrating spatial pattern and processes in dendritic systems.},

	abstract = {The historical, political and scientific aspects of salmon hatchery programmes designed to enhance fishery production, or to recover endangered populations, are reviewed. We start by pointing out that the establishment of hatcheries has been a political response to societal demands for harvest and conservation; given this social context, we then critically examined the levels of activity, the biological risks, and the economic analysis associated with salmon hatchery programmes. A rigorous analysis of the impacts of hatchery programmes was hindered by the lack of standardized data on release sizes and survival rates at all ecological scales, and since hatchery programme objectives are rarely defined, it was also difficult to measure their effectiveness at meeting release objectives. Debates on the genetic effects of hatchery programmes on wild fish have been dominated by whether correct management practices can reduce negative outcomes, but we noted that there has been an absence of programmatic research approaches addressing this important issue. Competitive interactions between hatchery and wild fish were observed to be complex, but studies researching approaches to reduce these interactions at all ecological scales during the entire salmon life history have been rare, and thus are not typically considered in hatchery management. Harvesting of salmon released from fishery enhancement hatcheries likely impacts vulnerable wild populations; managers have responded to this problem by mass marking hatchery fish, so that fishing effort can be directed towards hatchery populations. However, we noted that the effectiveness of this approach is dependant on accurate marking and production of hatchery fish with high survival rates, and it is not yet clear whether selective fishing will prevent overharvest of wild populations. Finally, research demonstrating disease transmission from hatchery fish to wild populations was observed to be equivocal; evidence in this area has been constrained by the lack of effective approaches to studying the fate of pathogens in the wild. We then reviewed several approaches to studying the economic consequences of hatchery activities intended to inform the social decisions surrounding programmes, but recognized that placing monetary value on conservation efforts or on hatcheries that mitigate cultural groups’ loss of historical harvest opportunities may complicate these analyses. We noted that economic issues have rarely been included in decision making on hatchery programmes. We end by identifying existing major knowledge gaps, which, if filled, could contribute towards a fuller understanding of the role that hatchery programmes could play in meeting divergent goals. However, we also recognized that many management recommendations arising from such research may involve trade-offs between different risks, and that decisions about these trade-offs must occur within a social context. Hatcheries have played an important role in sustaining some highly endangered populations, and it is possible that reform of practices will lead to an increase in the number of successful programmes. However, a serious appraisal of the role of hatcheries in meeting broader needs is urgently warranted and should take place at the scientific, but more effectively, at the societal level.},

Ecological theory and global-scale analyses of bird and mammal faunas suggest that small-bodied species are less vulnerable to extinction, yet this hypothesis remains untested for the largest group of vertebrates, fish. Here, we compare body-size distributions of freshwater and marine fishes under different levels of global extinction risk (i.e. listed as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species) from different major sources of threat (habitat loss/degradation, human harvesting, invasive species and pollution). Location Global, freshwater and marine. Methods We collated maximum body length data for 22,800 freshwater and marine fishes and compared body-size frequency distributions after controlling for phylogeny. Results We found that large-bodied marine fishes are under greater threat of global extinction, whereas both small- and large-bodied freshwater species are more likely to be at risk. Our results support the notion that commercial fishing activities disproportionately threaten large-bodied marine and freshwater species, whereas habitat degradation and loss threaten smaller-bodied marine fishes. Main conclusions Our study provides compelling evidence that global fish extinction risk does not universally scale with body size. Given the central role of body size for trophic position and the functioning of food webs, human activities may have strikingly different effects on community organization and food web structure in freshwater and marine systems.},

Here we use a novel measure of trophic niche width, based on stable isotope ratios, to assess effects of aquatic ecosystem fragmentation on trophic ecology of a resilient, dominant, top predator. We demonstrate collapse in trophic niche width of the predator in fragmented systems, a phenomenon related to significant reductions in diversity of potential prey taxa. Collapsed niche width reflects a homogenization of energy flow pathways to top predators, likely serving to destabilize remnant food webs and render apparently resilient top predators more susceptible to extinction through time.},

	abstract = {Species extinction and immigration are both common in natural communities and the sequence with which species are lost from or added to communities may be crucial to community structure. We experimentally addressed this issue by growing six green algal species in monocultures and all possible two-species mixtures, with two colonization sequences for each mixture. Both convergence and divergence in community structure were observed. The compositions containing particularly productive species were more likely to converge, while those comprising of species with similar monoculture yields were more likely to diverge. The species mixtures with high-yielding initial and low-yielding invading species produced more biomass than monocultures, but mixtures with the opposite assembly order produced only the same level of biomass as monocultures did. To address the diversity–ecosystem functioning issue, we estimate complementarity effect by relative yield total (RYT) and selection effect by the correlation between species’ monoculture yields and their relative yields in mixtures, respectively. We found overall negative complementarity and positive selection effect in mixtures with high-yielding species as initial colonizers, but positive complementarity and negative selection effect in mixtures with low-yielding initial species. Nonetheless, because we used only up to two species in each microcosm, our results are limited in addressing the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning. Future research should study the effects of immigration history with many more species involved in community assembly.},

This fitness decline can occur very quickly, sometimes following only one or two generations of captive rearing. In this review, we summarize existing data on the fitness of hatchery fish in the wild, and we investigate the conditions under which rapid fitness declines can occur. The summary of studies to date suggests: nonlocal hatchery stocks consistently reproduce very poorly in the wild; hatchery stocks that use wild, local fish for captive propagation generally perform better than nonlocal stocks, but often worse than wild fish. However, the data above are from a limited number of studies and species, and more studies are needed before one can generalize further. We used a simple quantitative genetic model to evaluate whether domestication selection is a sufficient explanation for some observed rapid fitness declines. We show that if selection acts on a single trait, such rapid effects can be explained only when selection is very strong, both in captivity and in the wild, and when the heritability of the trait under selection is high. If selection acts on multiple traits throughout the life cycle, rapid fitness declines are plausible.},

While recent studies have started to better clarify the relationship between food-chain length and environmental gradients such as resource availability and ecosystem size, much less progress has been made in isolating the ultimate and proximate mechanisms that determine food-chain length. Progress has been slow, in part, because research has paid little attention to the proximate changes in food web structure that must link variation in food-chain length to the ultimate dynamic mechanism. Here we outline the structural mechanisms that determine variation in food-chain length. We explore the implications of these mechanisms for understanding how changes in food-web structure influence food-chain length using both an intraguild predation community model and data from natural ecosystems. The resulting framework provides the mechanisms for linking ultimate dynamic mechanisms to variation in food-chain length. It also suggests that simple linear food-chain models may make misleading predictions about patterns of variation in food-chain length because they are unable to incorporate important structural mechanisms that alter food-web dynamics and cause non-linear shifts in food-web structure. Intraguild predation models provide a more appropriate theoretical framework for understanding food-chain length in most natural ecosystems because they accommodate all of the proximate structural mechanisms identified here.},

	abstract = {Nestedness has been widely reported for both metacommunities and networks of interacting species. Even though the concept of this ecological pattern has been well-defined, there are several metrics by which it can be quantified. We noted that current metrics do not correctly quantify two major properties of nestedness: (1) whether marginal totals (i.e. fills) differ among columns and/or among rows, and (2) whether the presences (1's) in less-filled columns and rows coincide, respectively, with those found in the more-filled columns and rows. We propose a new metric directly based on these properties and compare its behavior with that of the most used metrics, using a set of model matrices ranging from highly-nested to alternative structures in which no nestedness should be detected. We also used an empirical dataset to explore possible biases generated by the metrics as well as to evaluate correlations between metrics. We found that nestedness has been quantified by metrics that inappropriately detect this pattern, even for matrices in which there is no nestedness. In addition, the most used metrics are prone to type I statistical errors while our new metric has better statistical properties and consistently rejects a nested pattern for different types of random matrices. The analysis of the empirical data showed that two nestedness metrics, matrix temperature and the discrepancy measure, tend to overestimate the degrees of nestedness in metacommunities. We emphasize and discuss some implications of these biases for the theoretical understanding of the processes shaping species interaction networks and metacommunity structure.},

We use this theory to evaluate how the basic properties of a metacommunity – connectivity, size, and speciation rate – determine overall metacommunity γ-diversity, and how that is partitioned into α- and β-components. We find spatial structure can increase γ-diversity relative to a well-mixed model, even when θ is held constant. The magnitude of deviations from the well-mixed model and the partitioning into α- and β-diversity is related to the ratio of migration and speciation rates. γ-diversity scales linearly with metacommunity size even as α- and β-diversity scale nonlinearly with size.},

We measured the occurrence of stream burial within a major tributary to the Chesapeake Bay, for streams with catchment areas ranging from 10 ha to 104 ha. We used hydrologic modeling to identify where streams should be and then calibrated a map of impervious surface area, using high-resolution aerial photography to build a stream channel decision-tree classification. We found that 20\% of all streams were buried, with streams in low-residential and suburban areas outside Baltimore City exhibiting 19\% burial rates. Smaller headwater streams were more extensively buried than larger streams, and this difference increased with increasing impervious surface area. Within Baltimore City, 66\% of all streams and 70\% of streams in catchments smaller than 260 ha (1 mi2) were buried. In this densely urbanized city, headwater streams are buried to the same extent as is dry land.},

However, we need to know the fitness consequences of variation in sociability across environmental contexts in order to better understand the maintenance of such variation. In order to achieve this, we investigated the relationship between sociability and survival, body growth and fecundity, in one-year-old individuals in semi-natural populations with varying density. 'Asocial' and 'social' lizards displayed different fitness outcomes in populations of different densities. Asocial lizards survived better in low-density populations, while social females reproduced better.

	abstract = {A genre of papers has arisen around the premise that ecological progress and communication with non-specialists are impeded because (1) many ecological terms have multiple meanings and (2) many ecological terms have meanings similar to each other. There is a repeated call for ecological terminology to be standardized and for terms to be defined more concretely. These calls for the standardization of definitions are based on faulty premises about the way language conveys meaning. Most recommendations for definitional reform are unlikely to take hold due to properties of language and they are unlikely to stimulate increased ecological understanding. Precisely delimited definitions are necessary in very few instances, whereas extensive and prescriptive classification can hinder the development of a field by preventing some types of questions from being asked. Useful lexical reviews should focus on the development of ecological knowledge that is signaled by a wealth of terms and meanings, rather than critiquing the terms employed.},

Using microbial communities comprising bacterivorous ciliated protists assembled in laboratory microcosms, we experimentally investigated these questions by independently manipulating the intensity of disturbance (in the form of density-independent mortality) and community assembly history (including a control treatment with simultaneous species introduction and five sequential assembly treatments). Species diversity patterns consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis emerged in the controls, as several species showed responses indicative of a trade-off between competitive ability and ability to recover from disturbance. Species diversity in communities with sequential assembly, however, generally declined with disturbance, owing to the increased extinction risk of later colonizers at the intermediate level of disturbance. Similarities among communities subjected to different assembly histories increased with disturbance, a result due possibly to increasing disturbance reducing the importance of competition and hence priority effects. This finding is most consistent with the idea that increasing disturbance tends to reduce the likelihood of alternative stable states. Collectively, these results indicate the strong interactive effects of disturbance and assembly history on the structure of ecological communities.},

We compared marine survival of salmonids in areas with salmon farming to adjacent areas without farms in Scotland, Ireland, Atlantic Canada, and Pacific Canada to estimate changes in marine survival concurrent with the growth of salmon aquaculture. Through a meta-analysis of existing data, we show a reduction in survival or abundance of Atlantic salmon; sea trout; and pink, chum, and coho salmon in association with increased production of farmed salmon.

	abstract = {Abstract: The global amphibian crisis has resulted in renewed interest in captive breeding as a conservation tool for amphibians. Although captive breeding and reintroduction are controversial management actions, amphibians possess a number of attributes that make them potentially good models for such programs. We reviewed the extent and effectiveness of captive breeding and reintroduction programs for amphibians through an analysis of data from the Global Amphibian Assessment and other sources. Most captive breeding and reintroduction programs for amphibians have focused on threatened species from industrialized countries with relatively low amphibian diversity. Out of 110 species in such programs, 52 were in programs with no plans for reintroduction that had conservation research or conservation education as their main purpose. A further 39 species were in programs that entailed captive breeding and reintroduction or combined captive breeding with relocations of wild animals. Nineteen species were in programs with relocations of wild animals only. Eighteen out of 58 reintroduced species have subsequently bred successfully in the wild, and 13 of these species have established self-sustaining populations. As with threatened amphibians generally, amphibians in captive breeding or reintroduction programs face multiple threats, with habitat loss being the most important. Nevertheless, only 18 out of 58 reintroduced species faced threats that are all potentially reversible. When selecting species for captive programs, dilemmas may emerge between choosing species that have a good chance of surviving after reintroduction because their threats are reversible and those that are doomed to extinction in the wild as a result of irreversible threats. Captive breeding and reintroduction programs for amphibians require long-term commitments to ensure success, and different management strategies may be needed for species earmarked for reintroduction and species used for conservation research and education.},

	abstract = {Issue Title: Including a Special Feature on Spatial Population Synchrony
We investigated the relationship between genetic divergence and demographic dependence. Genetically related groups may consist of the same demographic unit or a single "population," because high levels of dispersal may synchronize population dynamics. We examined this hypothesis by assessing the levels of synchrony in seven demographic parameters among locations supporting stream-dwelling Dolly Varden. We analyzed synchrony using demographic data collected over 10 years in five neighboring tributary streams ({\textless}7 km) where little genetic divergence was observed. The overall synchrony was moderate for age-0+ and ≥age-1+ (average cross-correlation coefficient ρ[overline] = 0.32-0.56), but the synchrony decreased at later life stages (mature adults, ρ[overline] = 0.00-0.43). No significant temporal co-variation was observed for other demographic parameters (sex ratio and resident-to-migrant ratio, ρ[overline] = -0.19 and 0.38, respectively). Therefore, it appears that demographic synchrony was more prevalent for early life stages, but less so for later life stages, suggesting the demography of each tributary is unique. Furthermore, since an isolated location showed high levels of synchrony with the other locations, the main driver of synchrony is likely correlated environmental influences on demography (Moran effect) rather than dispersal. Pairwise synchrony was not correlated with geographical distance, but negatively correlated with the degree of genetic differentiation (F ST) in a few cases. Overall, however, we found little evidence that dispersal induces strong synchrony even among the neighboring tributaries where genetic analysis indicated considerable dispersal. Finally it is worth noting that the influences of dispersal may be different in terms of genetic and demographic contexts, and that density-dependent processes may mask patterns of observed synchrony.},

Location The Natura 2000 network of terrestrial protected areas in Greece, covering approximately 16\% of the national territory. Methods We used the Natura 2000 framework, which provides a classification scheme for natural habitat types, to quantify habitat heterogeneity. We analysed data for the plant species composition in 16,143 quadrats in which 5044 species and subspecies of higher plants were recorded. We built a simple mathematical model that incorporates the effect of habitat diversity on the species–area relationship (SAR). Results Our analysis showed that habitat diversity was correlated with area. However, keeping habitat diversity constant, species richness was related to area; while keeping area constant, species richness was related to habitat diversity. Comparing the SAR of the 237 sites we found that the slope of the species–area curve was related to habitat diversity. Main conclusions Discussion of the causes of the SAR has often focused on the primacy of area per se versus habitat heterogeneity, even though the two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and should be considered jointly. We find that increasing habitat diversity affects the SAR in different ways, but the dominant effect is to increase the slope of the SAR. While a full model fit typically includes a variety of terms involving both area and habitat richness, we find that the effect of habitat diversity can be reduced to a linear perturbation of the slope of the species accumulation curve.},

	abstract = {1 Anthropogenic landscape modifications have resulted in increased water depths and greater connectivity among the remaining shallow lakes throughout eastern portions of the Prairie Pothole Region of North America. This has created conditions favourable for the establishment of planktivorous fish populations, notably fathead minnows Pimephales promelas. Such fish populations may reach high densities and reduce zooplankton and macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity. Resulting reductions in algal grazing by zooplankton favour transition to a turbid-water state, characterized by increased phytoplankton, decreased water clarity, and reduced macrophytes. Ultimately, such lakes are characterized by low habitat complexity and biodiversity, and conditions less favourable for waterbirds and other wetland-dependent species. 2 We conducted a 3-year study to assess the efficacy of walleye Sander vitreus stocking as a means of initiating trophic cascades, thus testing the ecological theory that piscivore addition can promote shifts from the turbid to the clear-water state by suppressing planktivores (fathead minnows), increasing zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, and reducing phytoplankton. Treatments consisted of six sites stocked with walleye fry, six lakes stocked with walleye age-1 and older, and six control lakes containing antecedent fathead minnows only. 3 Stocking walleye fry resulted in much lower densities of fathead minnows and higher densities of cladocerans and some macroinvertebrates. Chlorophyll a also decreased in the fry treatment sites. Stocking age-1 and older walleye induced few changes at the stocking density we tested. 4 The success of walleye fry appears to be partly attributable to their rapid diet shift to fish prey and their ability to consume and suppress all life stages of planktivores (fry, juveniles, and adults). However, most responses to walleye fry additions were short-lived, indicating that achieving long-term improvements may require repeated restocking. 5 Synthesis and applications. The available evidence indicates that catchment-level restoration alone is often of limited utility in restoring clear-water conditions in shallow lakes. Our results indicated that stocking piscivorous fish has the potential to improve ecological characteristics of shallow lakes, overcoming tendencies towards phytoplankton dominance. We suggest that managers consider using piscivorous fish stocks, ideally in conjunction with catchment-level restoration measures, to stimulate improvement of ecological characteristics in shallow lakes.},

Here we examined the relative importance of area and shape of forest patches to species richness, species composition, and species abundance (abundance of each species) for 3 taxa (33 birds, 41 butterflies, and 91 forest-floor plants) in a fragmented landscape in central Hokkaido, northern Japan. We grouped the species according to their potential edge responses (interior-, neutral-, and edge-species groups for birds and forest-floor plants, woodland- and open-land-species groups for butterflies) and analyzed them separately. We used a shape index that was independent of area as an index of shape circularization. Hierarchical partitioning and variation partitioning revealed that patch area was generally more important than patch shape for species richness and species composition of birds and butterflies. For forest-floor plants, effects of patch area and shape were small, whereas effects of local forest structure were large. Patch area and circularization generally increased abundances of interior species of birds and forest-floor plants and woodland species of butterflies. Nevertheless, only patch circularization increased abundances of 1 woodland species of butterfly and 2 and 6 interior species of birds and forest-floor plants, respectively. We did not find any significant interaction effects between patch area and shape. Our results suggest that although reserves generally should be large and circular, there is a trade-off between patch area and shape, which should be taken into consideration when managing reserves.},

	abstract = {Habitat connectivity is a central factor in shaping aquatic biological communities, but few tools exist to describe and quantify this attribute at a network scale in riverine systems. Here, we develop a new index to quantify longitudinal connectivity of river networks based on the expected probability of an organism being able to move freely between two random points of the network. We apply this index to two fish life histories and evaluate the effects of the number, passability, and placement of barriers on river network connectivity through the use of simulated dendritic ecological networks. We then extend the index to a real world dendritic river system in Newfoundland, Canada. Our results indicate that connectivity in river systems, as represented by our index, is most impacted by the first few barriers added to the system. This is in contrast to terrestrial systems, which are more resilient to low levels of connectivity. The results show a curvilinear relationship between barrier passability and structural connectivity. This suggests that an incremental improvement in passability would result in a greater improvement to river network connectivity for more permeable barriers than for less permeable barriers. Our analysis of the index in simulated and real river networks also showed that barrier placement played an important role in connectivity. Not surprisingly, barriers located near the river mouth have the greatest impact on fish with diadromous life histories while those located near the center of the river network have the most impact on fish with potadromous life histories. The proposed index is conceptually simple and sufficiently flexible to deal with variations in river structure and biological communities. The index will enable researchers to account for connectivity in habitat studies and will also allow resource managers to characterize watersheds, assess cumulative impacts of multiple barriers and determine priorities for restoration.},

Drainage has transformed nutrient and hydrologic dynamics, structure, function, quantity, and configuration of stream and wetland ecosystems. In many agricultural regions, more than 80\% of some catchment basins may be drained by surface ditches and subsurface drain pipes (tiles). Natural channels have been straightened and deepened for surface drainage ditches with significant effects on channel morphology, instream habitats for aquatic organisms, floodplain and riparian connectivity, sediment dynamics, and nutrient cycling. The connection of formerly isolated wetland basins to extensive networks of surface drainage and the construction of main channel ditches through millions of acres of formerly low-lying marsh or wet prairie, where no defined channel may have previously existed, have resulted in large-scale conversion of aquatic habitat types, from wetland mosaics to linear systems. Reduced surface storage, increased conveyance, and increased effective drainage area have altered the dynamics of and generally increased flows in larger streams and rivers. Cumulatively, these changes in hydrology, geomorphology, nutrient cycling, and sediment dynamics have had profound implications for aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity.},

	abstract = {An increasing number of studies in a wide range of natural systems have investigated how pulses of resource availability influence ecological processes at individual, population, and community levels. Taken together, these studies suggest that some common processes may underlie pulsed resource dynamics in a wide diversity of systems. Developing a common framework of terms and concepts for the study of resource pulses may facilitate greater synthesis among these apparently disparate systems. Here, we propose a general definition of the resource pulse concept, outline some common patterns in the causes and consequences of resource pulses, and suggest a few key questions for future investigations. We define resource pulses as episodes of increased resource availability in space and time that combine low frequency (rarity), large magnitude (intensity), and short duration (brevity), and emphasize the importance of considering resource pulses at spatial and temporal scales relevant to specific resource–consumer interactions. Although resource pulses are uncommon events for consumers in specific systems, our review of the existing literature suggests that pulsed resource dynamics are actually widespread phenomena in nature. Resource pulses often result from climatic and environmental factors, processes of spatiotemporal accumulation and release, outbreak population dynamics, or a combination of these factors. These events can affect life history traits and behavior at the level of individual consumers, numerical responses at the population level, and indirect effects at the community level. Consumers show strategies for utilizing ephemeral resources opportunistically, reducing resource variability by averaging over larger spatial scales, and tolerating extended interpulse periods of reduced resource availability. Resource pulses can also create persistent effects in communities through several mechanisms. We suggest that the study of resource pulses provides opportunities to understand the dynamics of many specific systems, and may also contribute to broader ecological questions at individual, population, and community levels.},

I used six years of mark–recapture data on the stream salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus to test theoretical predictions of how variation in habitat quality affects LDD. Frequency of LDD was quantified using the kurtosis of yearly movement distributions from recaptured animals in a 1-km headwater stream. Temporal and spatial variation in habitat quality were quantified with spatially explicit data on the body condition and dispersion of individuals throughout the study stream. Using information-theoretic model selection criteria, I found that LDD increased during periods of low average body condition and low spatial variation in body condition. Consistent with basic theory, my results indicate that temporal variation in habitat quality is critical to initiating dispersal, and that LDD increases when animals must move farther to encounter higher-quality habitat. This suggests that information on how habitat quality varies in time and space can be useful for predicting LDD. More broadly, this study highlights the value of direct data on animal movement for testing dispersal theory.},

They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress.

The common practice so far has been to examine alternative assembly theories using dichotomist approaches of the form neutrality versus niche, or compensatory dynamics versus environmental forcing. In reality, all these mechanisms will be operating, albeit with different strengths. While there have been different approaches to community structure and dynamics, including neutrality and niche differentiation, less work has gone into separating out the temporal variation in species abundances into relative contributions from different components. Here we use a refined statistical machinery to decompose temporal fluctuations in species abundances into contributions from environmental stochasticity and inter-/intraspecific interactions, to see which ones dominate. We apply the methodology to community data from a range of taxa. Our results show that communities are largely driven by environmental fluctuations, and that member populations are, to different extents, regulated through intraspecific interactions, the effects of interspecific interactions remaining broadly minor. By decomposing the temporal variation in this way, we have been able to show directly what has been previously inferred indirectly: compensatory dynamics are in fact largely outweighed by environmental forcing, and the latter tends to synchronize the population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Hatchery fish stocking for stock enhancement has been operated at a massive and global scale. However, the use of hatchery fish as a means of stock enhancement is highly controversial, and little is known about its effects on wild stock and consequences for stock enhancement. Here we review the scientific literature on this subject in order to address a fundamental question — is hatchery stocking a help or harm for wild stock and stock enhancement? We summarized 266 peer-reviewed papers that were published in the last 50years, which describe empirical case studies on ecology and genetics of hatchery stocks and their effects on stock enhancement. Specifically, we asked whether hatchery stock and wild stock differed in fitness and the level of genetic variation, and whether stocking affected population abundance. Seventy studies contained comparisons between hatchery and wild stocks, out of which 23 studies showed significantly negative effects of hatchery rearing on the fitness of stocked fish, and 28 studies showed reduced genetic variation in hatchery populations. None of these studies suggested a positive genetic effect on the fitness of hatchery-reared individuals after release. These results suggest that negative effects of hatchery rearing are not just a concern but undeniably present in many aquaculture species. In a few cases, however, no obvious effect of hatchery rearing was observed, and a positive contribution of hatchery stock to the abundance of fish populations was indicated. These examples suggest that there is a chance to improve hatchery practices and mitigate the negative effects on wild stocks, although scientific data supporting the positive effect on stock enhancement are largely missing at this moment. Technically, microsatellite-based parentage assignments have been proven as a useful tool for the evaluation of reproductive fitness in natural settings, which is a key for stock enhancement by hatchery-based stocking. We discuss implications of these results, as well as their limitations and future directions.},

The effectiveness of VFSs has been widely studied at the plot scale, yet researchers generally agree that field scale implementations are far less effective. The purpose of this research was to develop a field scale VFS submodel for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). A model for the retention of sediments and nutrients in VFSs was developed from experimental observations derived from 22 publications. A runoff retention model was developed from Vegetative Filter Strip MODel (VFSMOD) simulations. This model was adapted to operate at the field scale by considering the effects of flow concentration generally absent from plot scale experiments. Flow concentration through 10 hypothetical VFSs was evaluated using high resolution (2 m) topographical data and multipath flow accumulation. Significant flow concentration was predicted at all sites, on average 10\% of the VFS received half of the field runoff. As implemented in SWAT, the VFS model contains two sections, a large section receiving relatively modest flow densities and a smaller section treating more concentrated flow. This field scale model was incorporated into SWAT and verified for proper function. This model enhances the ability of SWAT to evaluate the effectiveness of VFSs at the watershed scale.

	abstract = {The concept of functional redundancy is at the core of theory relating changes in ecosystem functioning to species loss. However, few empirical studies have investigated the strength and form of the relationship between species and functional diversity (i.e., the presence of functional redundancy in ecological communities) in this context. In particular, we know little about how local extinctions in real communities might impact functional diversity. Here, we examined the relationship between species and functional diversity in plant communities along a grazing gradient across Mongolian rangeland ecosystems. We applied a recently described measure of functional diversity that incorporates species' dissimilarities defined from plant functional traits and tested several hypothesized forms of the relationship between species and functional diversity using linear and nonlinear modeling techniques. We found a significant sigmoid logistic relationship between species richness and functional diversity in relatively benign environmental conditions. This indicates high functional redundancy at low levels of species richness followed by a rapid increase at intermediate levels, until functional diversity reaches an asymptote at high levels (i.e., two-phase functional redundancy). In contrast, we generally observed a positive linear relationship between these parameters in relatively harsh environmental conditions, indicating low functional redundancy. Observed functional redundancy probably resulted from two factors, intrinsic redundancy in species' functional traits and extrinsic redundancy caused by nonrandom compositional change that is nonrandom with respect to functional traits. Lack of either intrinsic or extrinsic redundancy may result in low functional redundancy. Two-phase functional redundancy suggests that functional traits are abruptly lost from a community below a certain level of species richness, and a community then shifts into a contrasting state that has a few limited functional groups characterized by disturbance-resistant traits, as a consequence of disturbances such as livestock grazing. This study represents a major step forward in predicting the consequences of livestock grazing on the functioning of Mongolian rangeland ecosystems.},

Previous numerical simulations have suggested that complex niche-structured models produce species abundance distributions (SADs) that are qualitatively similar to those of very simple neutral models that ignore differences between species. However, in the absence of an analytical treatment of niche models, one cannot tell whether the two classes of model produce the same patterns via similar or different mechanisms. We present an analytical proof that, in the limit as diversity becomes large, a strong niche model give rises to exactly the same asymptotic form of SAD as the neutral model, and we verify the analytical predictions for a Panamanian tropical forest data set. Our results strongly suggest that neutral processes drive patterns of relative species abundance in high-diversity ecological communities, even when strong niche structure exists. However, neutral theory cannot explain what generates high diversity in the first place, and it may not be valid in low-diversity communities. Our results also confirm that neutral theory cannot be used to infer an absence of niche structure or to explain ecosystem function.},

The aim of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the assessment of beta diversity, disentangling the contribution of spatial turnover and nestedness to beta-diversity patterns. Innovation I derive an additive partitioning of beta diversity that provides the two separate components of spatial turnover and nestedness underlying the total amount of beta diversity. I propose two families of measures of beta diversity for pairwise and multiple-site situations. Each family comprises one measure accounting for all aspects of beta diversity, which is additively decomposed into two measures accounting for the pure spatial turnover and nestedness components, respectively. Finally, I provide a case study using European longhorn beetles to exemplify the relevance of disentangling spatial turnover and nestedness patterns. Main conclusion Assigning the different beta-diversity patterns to their respective biological phenomena is essential for analysing the causality of the processes underlying biodiversity. Thus, the differentiation of the spatial turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity is crucial for our understanding of central biogeographic, ecological and conservation issues.},

	volume = {79},
	abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Increasingly, ecologists conceptualize local communities as connected to a regional species pool rather than as isolated entities. By this paradigm, community structure is determined through the relative strengths of dispersal-driven regional effects and local environmental factors. However, despite explicit incorporation of dispersal, metacommunity models and frameworks often fail to capture the realities of natural systems by not accounting for the configuration of space within which organisms disperse. This shortcoming may be of particular consequence in riverine networks which consist of linearly -arranged, hierarchical, branching habitat elements. Our goal was to understand how constraints of network connectivity in riverine systems change the relative importance of local vs. regional factors in structuring communities. 2. We hypothesized that communities in more isolated headwaters of riverine networks would be structured by local forces, while mainstem sections would be structured by both local and regional processes. We examined these hypotheses using a spatially explicit regional analysis of riverine macroinvertebrate communities, focusing on change in community similarity with distance between local communities [i.e., distance-decay relationships; (DDRs)], and the change in environmental similarity with distance. Strong DDRs frequently indicate dispersal-driven dynamics. 3. There was no evidence of a DDR in headwater communities, supporting our hypothesis that dispersal is a weak structuring force. Furthermore, a positive relationship between community similarity and environmental similarity supported dynamics driven by local environmental factors (i.e., species sorting). In mainstem habitats, significant DDRs and community x environment similarity relationships suggested both dispersal-driven and environmental constraints on local community structure (i.e., mass effects). 4. We used species traits to compare communities characterized by low vs. high dispersal taxa. In headwaters, neither strength nor mode (in-network vs. out of network) of dispersal changed our results. However, outcomes in mainstems changed substantially with both dispersal mode and strength, further supporting the hypothesis that regional forces drive community dynamics in mainstems. 5. Our findings demonstrate that the balance of local and regional effects changes depending on location within riverine network with local (environmental) factors dictating community structure in headwaters, and regional (dispersal driven) forces dominating in mainstems.},

This pattern emerges because β-diversity (compositional variation across local sites) increases with productivity, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unknown. Using data from a long-term experiment in replicate ponds, I show that higher β-diversity at higher productivity resulted from a stronger role for stochastic relative to deterministic assembly processes with increasing productivity. This shift in the relative importance of stochasticity was most consistent with the hypothesis of more intense priority effects leading to multiple stable equilibria at higher productivity. Thus, shifts in community assembly mechanisms across a productivity gradient may underlie one of the most prominent biodiversity gradients on the planet.},

Implicit in this hypothesis is that species richness should scale with energy in the same way in which it scales with area in species‐area relationships. We developed a novel framework for thinking about the interaction of area and energy, and we provide the first global test of this equivalence assumption using a data set on terrestrial breeding birds. We found that (1) species‐energy slopes are typically greater than species‐area slopes, (2) the magnitude of species‐area and species‐energy slopes varies strongly across the globe, and (3) the degree to which area and energy interact to determine species richness depends on the way mean values of species occupancy change along the energy gradient.

	abstract = {The frequently observed positive correlation between species diversity and community biomass is thought to depend on both the degree of resource partitioning and on competitive dominance between consumers, two properties that are also central to theories of species coexistence. To make an explicit link between theory on the causes and consequences of biodiversity, we define in a precise way two kinds of differences among species: niche differences, which promote coexistence, and relative fitness differences, which promote competitive exclusion. In a classic model of exploitative competition, promoting coexistence by increasing niche differences typically, although not universally, increases the “relative yield total,” a measure of diversity's effect on the biomass of competitors. In addition, however, we show that promoting coexistence by decreasing relative fitness differences also increases the relative yield total. Thus, two fundamentally different mechanisms of species coexistence both strengthen the influence of diversity on biomass yield. The model and our analysis also yield insight on the interpretation of experimental diversity manipulations. Specifically, the frequently reported “complementarity effect” appears to give a largely skewed estimate of resource partitioning. Likewise, the “selection effect” does not seem to isolate biomass changes attributable to species composition rather than species richness, as is commonly presumed. We conclude that past inferences about the cause of observed diversity–function relationships may be unreliable, and that new empirical estimates of niche and relative fitness differences are necessary to uncover the ecological mechanisms responsible for diversity–function relationships.},

	abstract = {Food chain length (FCL) is a fundamental component of food web structure. Studies in a variety of ecosystems suggest that FCL is determined by energy supply, environmental stability, and/or ecosystem size, but the nature of the relationship between environmental stability and FCL, and the mechanism linking ecosystem size to FCL, remain unclear. Here we show that FCL increases with drainage area and decreases with hydrologic variability and intermittency across 36 North American rivers. Our analysis further suggests that hydrologic variability is the mechanism underlying the correlation between ecosystem size and FCL in rivers. Ecosystem size lengthens river food chains by integrating and attenuating discharge variation through stream networks, thereby enhancing environmental stability in larger river systems.
The lengths of river food chains are indirectly related to drainage area and directly affected by flow and discharge.

Additionally, heterogeneity in habitat quality within the habitat network can alter patterns of diversity at local and regional scales in the metacommunity. Using a controlled experiment we examined the interactive effects of habitat connectivity, network form (linear vs square), and habitat patch quality on a moss-inhabiting microarthropod community. We fragmented moss habitat while controlling for habitat loss, and altered habitat patch quality by regulating moisture conditions in landscapes differing in patch arrangement. Habitat patch quality had a significant effect on patterns of species richness, extinction, abundance and biomass. The effects of network form on diversity were strongest in heterogeneous landscapes. Gamma and beta diversity were greatest in continuous and linear landscapes. However, linear habitat networks showed marked patch specific edge effects that were detrimental to diversity under heterogeneous conditions. We provide direct evidence that habitat network structure impacts species community properties through mass effects, that are most evident when heterogeneity in habitat patch quality is present within the network. We conclude that habitat quality at the individual patch level and the distribution of high-quality habitat within the network are important factors affecting biodiversity in metacommunities.},

	abstract = {Understanding/predicting ecological invasions is an important challenge in modern ecology because of their immense economical and ecological costs. Recent studies have revealed that within-species variation in behaviour (i.e. animal personality) can shed light on the invasion process. The general hypothesis is that individuals' personality type may affect their colonization success, suggesting that some individuals might be better invaders than others. We have recently shown that, in the invasive mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), social personality trait was an important indicator of dispersal distance, with more asocial individuals dispersing further. Here, we tested how mean personality within a population, in addition to individual personality type, affect dispersal and settlement decisions in the mosquitofish. We found that individual dispersal tendencies were influenced by the population's mean boldness and sociability score. For example, individuals from populations with more asocial individuals or with more bold individuals are more likely to disperse regardless of their own personality type. We suggest that identifying behavioural traits facilitating invasions, even at the group level, can thus have direct applications in pest management.\%U http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/278/1712/1670.full.pdf},

	abstract = {It has been increasingly recognized that landscape matrices are an important factor determining patch connectivity and hence the population size of organisms living in highly fragmented landscapes. However, most previous studies estimated the effect of matrix heterogeneity using prior information regarding dispersal or habitat preferences of a focal organism. Here we estimated matrix resistance of harvest mice in agricultural landscapes using a novel pattern-oriented modeling with Bayesian estimation and no prior information, and then conducted model validation using data sets independent from those used for model construction. First, we investigated the distribution patterns of harvest mice for approximately 400 habitat patches, and estimated matrix resistance for different matrix types using statistical models incorporating patch size, patch environment, and patch connectivity. We used Bayesian estimation with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and searched for appropriate matrix resistance that best explained the distribution pattern. Patch connectivity as well as patch quality was an important determinant of local population size for the harvest mice. Moreover, matrix resistance was far from uniform, with rice and crop fields exhibiting low resistance and forests, creeks, roads and residential areas showing much higher resistance. The deviance explained by this model (heterogeneous matrix model) was much larger than that obtained by the model with no consideration of matrix heterogeneity (homogeneous matrix model). Second, we obtained distribution data from five additional landscapes that were more fragmented than that used for model construction, and used them for model validation. The heterogeneous matrix model well predicted the population size for four out of five landscapes. In contrast, the homogeneous model considerably overestimated population sizes in all cases. Our approach is widely applicable to species living in fragmented landscapes, especially those for which prior information regarding movement or dispersal is difficult to obtain.},

For lake ecosystems, this has led to interest in quantifying the contribution of terrestrial allochthonous carbon to aquatic secondary production. An inverse relationship between habitat area and the role of allochthonous subsidies has been documented on marine islands and assumed for lakes, yet there have been no tests of this pattern among benthic (lake bottom) consumers. Here, we used carbon stable isotopes to trace terrestrial allochthonous and benthic autochthonous carbon use by the crayfish

              transitioned from using predominantly terrestrial carbon in small lakes to an increased reliance on autochthonous production in larger lakes. However, shoreline urbanization interacted with this pattern, particularly for small lakes where greater urbanization resulted in reduced use of allochthonous resources. As such, we provide, to our knowledge, the first confirmation of the predicted relationship between habitat size and importance of allochthonous subsidies to lake benthic consumers, but found that urbanization can interfere with this pattern.},

	abstract = {Summary. Continuously indexed Gaussian fields (GFs) are the most important ingredient in spatial statistical modelling and geostatistics. The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some GFs in the Matérn class, provide an explicit link, for any triangulation of , between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere.},

Biological Diversity covers fundamental measurement issues such as sampling, re-examines familiar diversity metrics (including species richness, diversity statistics, and estimates of spatial and temporal turnover), discusses species abundance distributions and how best to fit them, explores species occurrence and the spatial structure of biodiversity, and investigates alternative approaches used to assess trait, phylogenetic, and genetic diversity.

We based our model on empirically measured quantities, minimal ecological assumptions and stochastic processes. In nature, we found aggregated patterns of species biovolume (i.e. clumps) along the volume axis and a peak in species richness. Both patterns were reproduced by the MLVC model. Observed clumps corresponded to niche zones (volumes) where species fitness was highest, or where fitness was equal among competing species. The latter implies the action of equalizing processes, which would suggest emergent neutrality as a plausible mechanism to explain community patterns.},

Endangered Japanese trout (Salvelinus leucomaenis japonicus) readily ate these infected orthopterans, which due to their abundance, accounted for 60\% of the annual energy intake of the trout population. Trout grew fastest in the fall, when nematomorphs were driving energy-rich orthopterans into the stream. When infected orthopterans were available, trout did not eat benthic invertebrates in proportion to their abundance, leading to the potential for cascading, indirect effects through the forest-stream ecosystem.

In this study, we propose a new global river routing model, CaMa-Flood, which explicitly parameterizes the subgrid-scale topography of a floodplain, thus describing floodplain inundation dynamics. The relationship between water storage, water level, and flooded area in the model is decided on the basis of the subgrid-scale topographic parameters based on 1 km resolution digital elevation model. Horizontal water transport is calculated with a diffusive wave equation, which realizes the backwater effect in flat river basins. A set of global-scale river flow simulations demonstrated an improved predictability of daily-scale river discharge in many major world rivers by incorporating the floodplain inundation dynamics. Detailed analysis of the simulated results for the Amazon River suggested that introduction of the diffusive wave equation is essential for simulating water surface elevation realistically. The simulated spatiotemporal variation of the flooded area in the Amazon basin showed a good correlation with satellite observations, especially when the backwater effect was considered. The improved predictability for daily river discharge, water surface elevation, and inundated areas by the proposed model will promote climate system studies and water resource assessments.},

	abstract = {Using hierarchical Bayesian analysis, we tested the hypothesis that a perennial tussock grass, Ischaemum aristatum var. glaucum, facilitates the species diversity of vegetation and the regeneration of individual native vascular plants in Ukishima Marsh, a moist tall grassland of eastern Japan. We analyzed microscale distribution patterns of sympatric plant species in response to ground height. Both the species richness of the whole plant assemblage and the occurrence of many native vascular plants, including two endangered species, were positively correlated with ground elevation, which was directly mediated by I. aristatum var. glaucum tussocks and/or the occurrence of mosses on tussocks. Susceptibility to late spring inundation of microsites on the tussocks was signiﬁcantly lower than that on bare ground. These results suggest that the facilitation by I. aristatum var. glaucum contributes to maintaining the high species richness of the marsh. Consideration of the facilitation among native vascular plants is necessary for establishing sound conservation plans of wetland vegetation.},

	abstract = {The precarious state of many nearshore marine ecosystems has prompted the use of marine protected areas as a tool for management and conservation. However, there remains substantial debate over their design and, in particular, how to best account for the spatial dynamics of nearshore marine species. Many commercially important nearshore marine species are sedentary as adults, with limited home ranges. It is as larvae that they disperse greater distances, traveling with ocean currents sometimes hundreds of kilometers. As a result, these species exist in spatially complex systems of connected subpopulations. Here, we explicitly account for the mutual dependence of subpopulations and approach protected area design in terms of network robustness. Our goal is to characterize the topology of nearshore metapopulation networks and their response to perturbation, and to identify critical subpopulations whose protection would reduce the risk for stock collapse. We define metapopulation networks using realistic estimates of larval dispersal generated from ocean circulation simulations and spatially explicit metapopulation models, and we then explore their robustness using node-removal simulation experiments. Nearshore metapopulations show small-world network properties, and we identify a set of highly connected hub subpopulations whose removal maximally disrupts the metapopulation network. Protecting these subpopulations reduces the risk for systemic failure and stock collapse. Our focus on catastrophe avoidance provides a unique perspective for spatial marine planning and the design of marine protected areas.},

They may equally be incurred during life stages before the actual dispersal event through investments in special morphologies. Because costs will eventually determine the performance of dispersing individuals and the evolution of dispersal, we here provide an extensive review on the different cost types that occur during dispersal in a wide array of organisms, ranging from micro-organisms to plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. In general, costs of transfer have been more widely documented in actively dispersing organisms, in contrast to a greater focus on costs during departure and settlement in plants and animals with a passive transfer phase. Costs related to the development of specific dispersal attributes appear to be much more prominent than previously accepted. Because costs induce trade-offs, they give rise to covariation between dispersal and other life-history traits at different scales of organismal organisation. The consequences of (i) the presence and magnitude of different costs during different phases of the dispersal process, and (ii) their internal organisation through covariation with other life-history traits, are synthesised with respect to potential consequences for species conservation and the need for development of a new generation of spatial simulation models.},

However, temporal changes in population counts may vary among survey sites for both ecological and artificial reasons, confounding existing population indices estimated without accounting for such variations. We created a smoothed hierarchical model, and compared its performance against the conventional approaches (generalized linear models and generalized additive models) and a non-smoothed hierarchical model using simulation data with a known nonlinear trend. The smoothed hierarchical model always estimated population indices with the best accuracy and precision; the performance of other models deteriorated substantially with increasing variation in trends of population counts among sites, causing inaccurate estimation of population growth rates. The estimated variations in trends of population counts among sites for 233 out of 518 North American breeding bird species were larger than the value used in the simulation where there was a considerable difference in the performance between hierarchical models and the conventional approaches. These estimated variations in trends of population counts among sites were particularly large in gregarious waterbirds. These results suggest that the smoothed hierarchical model developed in this study should play an important role in accurately assessing population indices, particularly for gregarious waterbirds, using count data from large-scale, long-term surveys in the field.},

Eighty-two sites, with drainage areas ranging from 4.3 to 2200 km2, were examined for nutrient concentrations, measures of aquatic-community health (e.g., fish index of biotic integrity [IBI] scores), and environmental factors (e.g., drainage area and amount of agricultural land retirement). The relation of proximity of agricultural land retirement to the stream was determined by calculating the land retirement percent in various riparian zones. Spearman's rho results indicated that IBI score was not correlated to the percentage of agricultural land retirement at the basin scale (p = 0.070); however, IBI score was correlated to retired land percentage in the 50- to 400-m riparian zones surrounding the streams (p {\textless} 0.05), indicating that riparian agricultural land retirement may have more influence on aquatic-community health than does agricultural land retirement in upland areas. Multivariate analysis of covariance and analysis of covariance models indicated that other environmental factors (such as drainage area and lacustrine and palustrine features) commonly were correlated to aquatic-community health measures, as were in-stream factors (standard deviation of water depth and substrate type). These results indicate that although agricultural land retirement is significantly related to fish communities as measured by the IBI scores, a combination of basin, riparian, and in-stream factors act together to influence IBI scores.},

By spreading within their historical range, attaining extreme abundances, and exerting severe per-capita effects as a result of predation or competition, native invaders can create an unusual set of challenges for science, management, policy, and society. Identifying when, where, and why species become invaders in their native ranges requires additional scientific inquiry, outside the current focus of invasion biology. Management strategies often mitigate the symptoms rather than address the causes of problematic native species invasions. Convincing stakeholders to comply with management actions aimed at controlling native invaders creates societal challenges and policy makers must prioritize goals from varied and often conflicting human interests. We illustrate these challenges by highlighting native species that adversely affect threatened and endangered Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp).},

Recently, stable isotope mixing models have been widely used to quantify dietary proportions of different food resources to a focal consumer. Here we propose a novel mixing model (IsoWeb) that estimates diet proportions of all consumers in a food web based on stable isotope information. IsoWeb requires a topological description of a food web, and stable isotope signatures of all consumers and resources in the web. A merit of IsoWeb is that it takes into account variation in trophic enrichment factors among different consumer-resource links. Sensitivity analysis using realistic hypothetical food webs suggests that IsoWeb is applicable to a wide variety of food webs differing in the number of species, connectance, sample size, and data variability. Sensitivity analysis based on real topological webs showed that IsoWeb can allow for a certain level of topological uncertainty in target food webs, including erroneously assuming false links, omission of existent links and species, and trophic aggregation into trophospecies. Moreover, using an illustrative application to a real food web, we demonstrated that IsoWeb can compare the plausibility of different candidate topologies for a focal web. These results suggest that IsoWeb provides a powerful tool to analyze food-web structure from stable isotope data. We provide R and BUGS codes to aid efficient applications of IsoWeb.},

Such global hazard maps can be generated using large scale physically based models of rainfall-runoff and river routing, when used in conjunction with a number of post-processing methods. In this study, the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) land surface model is coupled to ERA-Interim reanalysis meteorological forcing data, and resultant runoff is passed to a river routing algorithm which simulates floodplains and flood flow across the global land area. The global hazard map is based on a 30 yr (1979–2010) simulation period. A Gumbel distribution is fitted to the annual maxima flows to derive a number of flood return periods. The return periods are calculated initially for a 25 \&times; 25 km grid, which is then reprojected onto a 1 \&times; 1 km grid to derive maps of higher resolution and estimate flooded fractional area for the individual 25 \&times; 25 km cells. Several global and regional maps of flood return periods ranging from 2 to 500 yr are presented. The results compare reasonably to a benchmark data set of global flood hazard. The developed methodology can be applied to other datasets on a global or regional scale.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Fish aquaculture for commodity production, fisheries enhancement and conservation is expanding rapidly, with many cultured species undergoing inadvertent or controlled domestication. Cultured fish are frequently released, accidentally and deliberately, into natural environments where they may survive well and impact on wild fish populations through ecological, genetic, and technical interactions. Impacts of fish released accidentally or for fisheries enhancement tend to be negative for the wild populations involved, particularly where wild populations are small, and/or highly adapted to local conditions, and/or declining. Captive breeding and supplementation can play a positive role in restoring threatened populations, but the biology of threatened populations and the potential of culture approaches for conserving them remain poorly understood. Approaches to the management of domestication and cultured-wild fish interactions are often ad hoc, fragmented and poorly informed by current science. We develop an integrative biological framework for understanding and managing domestication and cultured-wild fish interactions. The framework sets out how management practices in culture and for cultured fish in natural environments affect domestication processes, interactions between cultured and wild fish, and outcomes in terms of commodity production, fisheries yield, and conservation. We also develop a typology of management systems (specific combinations of management practices in culture and in natural environments) that are likely to provide positive outcomes for particular management objectives and situations. We close by setting out avenues for further research that will simultaneously improve fish domestication and management of cultured-wild fish interactions and provide key insights into fundamental biology.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, productivity and disturbance have been hypothesized as important determinants of food-chain length. More recently, growing empirical evidence suggests a strong role of ecosystem size. To theoretically explore the effects of basal productivity, disturbance, and ecosystem size on food-chain length, we develop and analyze a metacommunity model of intraguild predation (IGP). The model finds that, when local IGP is weak, increasing basal productivity, weakening disturbance, and increasing ecosystem size will generally increase food-chain length. When local IGP is strong, by contrast, increasing basal productivity or weakening disturbance favors intraguild predators and hinders the coexistence of intraguild predators and intraguild prey, limiting food-chain length. In contrast, increasing ecosystem size can promote coexistence even when local IGP is strong, increasing food-chain length through inserting intraguild prey and changing the degree of omnivory by intraguild predators. Intraguild prey needs to be the superior colonizer to intraguild predators for this to occur. We discuss that these theoretical predictions appear consistent with empirical patterns.},

	abstract = {Effects of fragmentation on the ecology of organisms occupying dendritic ecological networks (DENs) have recently been described through both conceptual and mathematical models, but few hypotheses have been tested in complex, real-world ecosystems. Stream fishes provide a model system for assessing effects of fragmentation on the structure of communities occurring within DENs, including how fragmentation alters metacommunity dynamics and biodiversity. A recently developed habitat-availability measure, the “dendritic connectivity index” (DCI), allows for assigning quantitative measures of connectivity in DENs regardless of network extent or complexity, and might be used to predict fish community response to fragmentation. We characterized stream fish community structure in 12 DENs in the Great Plains, USA, during periods of dynamic (summer) and muted (fall) discharge regimes to test the DCI as a predictive model of fish community response to fragmentation imposed by road crossings. Results indicated that fish communities in stream segments isolated by road crossings had reduced species richness (alpha diversity) relative to communities that maintained connectivity with the surrounding DEN during summer and fall. Furthermore, isolated communities had greater dissimilarity (beta diversity) to downstream sites not isolated by road crossings during summer and fall. Finally, dissimilarity among communities within DENs decreased as a function of increased habitat connectivity (measured using the DCI) for summer and fall, suggesting that communities within highly connected DENs tend to be more homogeneous. Our results indicate that the DCI is sensitive to community effects of fragmentation in riverscapes and might be used by managers to predict ecological responses to changes in habitat connectivity. Moreover, our findings illustrate that relating structural connectivity of riverscapes to functional connectivity among communities might aid in maintaining metacommunity dynamics and biodiversity in complex dendritic ecosystems.},

However, long-term persistence of rare species has been difficult to produce in trait-based models of coexistence that incorporate stochastic dynamics, raising questions about how rare species persist despite such variability. Following recent evidence that rare species may experience significantly different population dynamics than dominant species, we use a plant community model to simulate the effect of disproportionately strong negative frequency dependence on the long-term persistence of the rare species in a simulated community. This strong self-limitation produces long persistence times for the rare competitors, which otherwise succumb quickly to stochastic extinction. The results suggest that the mechanism causing species to be rare in this case is the same mechanism allowing those species to persist.},

	abstract = {A financial portfolio metaphor is often used to describe how population diversity can increase temporal stability of a group of populations. The portfolio effect (PE) refers to the stabilizing effect from a population acting as a group or ‘portfolio’ of diverse subpopulations instead of a single homogeneous population or ‘asset’. A widely used measure of the PE (the average-CV PE) implicitly assumes that the slope (z) of a log–log plot of mean temporal abundance and variance (Taylor's power law) equals two. Existing theory suggests an additional unexplored empirical PE that accounts for z, the mean–variance PE. We use a theoretical and empirical approach to explore the strength and drivers of the PE for metapopulations when we account for Taylor's power law compared with when we do not. Our empirical comparison uses data from 51 metapopulations and 1070 subpopulations across salmon, moths and reef fishes. Ignoring Taylor's power law may overestimate the stabilizing effect of population diversity for metapopulations. The disparity between the metrics is greatest at low z values where the average-CV PE indicates a strong PE. Compared with the mean–variance method, the average-CV PE estimated a stronger PE in 84\% of metapopulations by up to sevenfold. The divergence between the methods was strongest for reef fishes (1·0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1·7) followed by moths (1·5 {\textless} z {\textless} 1·9). The PEs were comparable for salmon where z ≈ 2. We outline practical recommendations for estimating ecological PEs based on research questions, study systems and available data. Because most PEs were stabilizing and diversity can be slow to restore, our meta-analysis of metapopulations suggests that the safest management approach is to conserve biological complexity.},

Location World-wide. Methods We amassed 601 data sets from terrestrial islands and employed an information-theoretic framework to test for the best-fit ISAR model, family, and shape, and for the presence/absence of an asymptote. Two main criteria were applied: generality (the proportion of cases for which the model provided an adequate fit) and efficiency (the overall probability of a model, when adequate, being the best at explaining ISARs; evaluated using the mean overall AICc weight). Multivariate analyses were used to explore the potential of island system properties to explain trends in ISAR form, and to describe variation in the parameters of the logarithmic power model. Results Adequate fits were obtained for 465 data sets. The simpler models performed best, with the power model ranked first. Similar results were obtained at model family level. The ISAR form is most commonly convex upwards, without an asymptote. Island system traits had low descriptive power in relation to variation in ISAR form. However, the z and c parameters of the logarithmic power model show significant pattern in relation to island system type and taxon. Main conclusions Over most scales of space, ISARs are best represented by the power model and other simple models. More complex, sigmoid models may be applicable when the spatial range exceeds three orders of magnitude. With respect to the log power model, z-values are indicative of the process(es) establishing species richness and composition patterns, while c-values are indicative of the realized carrying capacity of the system per unit area. Variation in ISAR form is biologically meaningful, but the signal is noisy, as multiple processes constrain the ecological space available within island systems and the relative importance of these processes varies with the spatial scale of the system.},

Juvenile coho salmon made feeding forays into cold habitats with abundant food, and then moved long distances (350–1300 m) to warmer habitats that accelerated their metabolism and increased their assimilative capacity. This behavioral thermoregulation enabled ﬁsh to mitigate trade-offs between trophic and thermal resources by exploiting thermal heterogeneity. Fish that exploited thermal heterogeneity grew at substantially faster rates than did individuals that assumed other behaviors.

Fish diversity, habitat structure, and water quality had significant effects on the number of people fishing and playing in the rivers. The number of people walking and engaging in sports, which typically takes place on floodplains and dikes, was significantly positively related to the size of the surrounding population rather than to biodiversity or habitat structure. However, water quality had significant effects on such uses of river ecosystems, even though these activities did not involve direct contact with river water.

	abstract = {Although numerous studies have attempted to place species of interest within the context of food webs, such efforts have generally occurred at small scales or disregard potentially important spatial heterogeneity. If food web approaches are to be employed to manage species, studies are needed that evaluate the multiple habitats and associated webs of interactions in which these species participate. Here, we quantify the food webs that sustain rearing salmon and steelhead within a floodplain landscape of the Methow River, Washington, USA, a location where restoration has been proposed to restore side channels in an attempt to recover anadromous fishes. We combined year-long measures of production, food demand, and diet composition for the fish assemblage with estimates of invertebrate prey productivity to quantify food webs within the main channel and five different, intact, side channels; ranging from channels that remained connected to the main channel at low flow to those reduced to floodplain ponds. Although we found that habitats within the floodplain had similar invertebrate prey production, these habitats hosted different local food webs. In the main channel, 95\% of total prey consumption flowed to fishes that are not the target of proposed restoration. These fishes consumed 64\% and 47\% of the prey resources that were found to be important to fueling chinook and steelhead production in the main channel, respectively. Conversely, in side channels, a greater proportion of prey was consumed by anadromous salmonids. As a result, carrying capacity estimates based on food were 251\% higher, on average, for anadromous salmonids in side channels than the main channel. However, salmon and steelhead production was generally well below estimated capacity in both the main and side channels, suggesting these habitats are under-seeded with respect to food, and that much larger populations could be supported. Overall, this study demonstrates that floodplain heterogeneity is associated with the occurrence of a mosaic of food webs, all of which were utilized by anadromous salmonids, and all of which may be important to their recovery and persistence. In the long term, these and other fishes would likely benefit from restoring the processes that maintain floodplain complexity.},

These links between behavioural types and dispersal should vary with the cause of dispersal. However, with the exception of one study, personality-dependent dispersal has not been studied in contrasting environments. Here, we used mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) to test whether personality-dependent dispersal varies with predation risk, a factor that should induce boldness or sociability-dependent dispersal. Corroborating previous studies, we found that dispersing mosquitofish are less social than non-dispersing fish when there was no predation risk. However, personality-dependent dispersal is negated under predation risk, dispersers having similar personality types to residents.

We quantified seasonal changes in the coverage of intertidal barnacles, Chthamalus spp., with data collected for as many as 9 years at 88 plots in five regions located along more than 1800 km of the Pacific coastline of Japan from 31° N to 43° N. To examine how seasonal changes and the spatial heterogeneity of environments can interact to influence patterns and processes of population dynamics, we analyzed the data with two models of population variability: a population dynamics model, which provides knowledge about processes that determine population growth rates; and Taylor's power law, which summarizes the relationship between the temporal mean and variance of the size of a population (temporal mean-variance relationship). We found that seasonal differences were prevalent in population growth rates, as well as in the strength and spatial scales of processes that determine population growth rates. In addition, the seasonality of these rates and processes varied between habitats at different spatial scales ranging from the scale of among-rocks within a shore to that of among-regions located in different latitudes, suggesting that the effects of seasonal environmental fluctuations on population growth can depend on the spatial heterogeneity of biotic and abiotic conditions that vary at multiple spatial scales. In contrast, the evidence for spatiotemporal differences in temporal mean-variance relationships was weak. Unlike theoretical expectations, spatiotemporal differences in the variability of population size were best explained by a unique power law, despite remarkable regional and seasonal differences in the processes that determine population growth rates. These results suggest that spatiotemporal environmental variability can affect population dynamics at multiple spatial scales but do not necessarily alter the scaling law of population size variability.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic traits mediate organisms' interactions with the environment and determine how they affect and are affected by their biotic and abiotic milieu. Thus, dispersion of trait values, or functional diversity (FD) of a community can offer insights into processes driving community assembly. For example, underdispersion of FD suggests that habitat “filtering” of species with unfavorable trait values restricts the species that can exist in a particular habitat, while even spacing of FD suggests that interspecific competition, or biotic “sorting,” discourages the coexistence of species with similar trait values. Since assembly processes are expected to vary as a function of spatial scale, we should also expect patterns of FD to reflect scale dependence in filtering and biotic sorting. Here we present the concept of the functional-diversity–area relationship (FAR), which is similar to the species–area relationship but plots a measure of phenotypic trait diversity as a function of spatial scale. We develop a set of null model tests that discriminate between FARs generated predominantly by filtering or biotic sorting and indicate the scales at which these effects are pronounced. The utility of the FAR for addressing long-standing issues in ecology is illustrated with several examples. A multi-scale examination of FD and its pattern relative to null expectations provides an important tool for ecologists interested in understanding the scale dependence of community assembly processes.},

We show how the total variance of Y can be calculated either directly or through a dissimilarity matrix obtained using any dissimilarity index deemed appropriate for pairwise comparisons of community composition data. We addressed the question of which index to use by coding 16 indices using 14 properties that are necessary for beta assessment, comparability among data sets, sampling issues and ordination. Our comparison analysis classified the coefficients under study into five types, three of which are appropriate for beta diversity assessment. Our approach links the concept of beta diversity with the analysis of community data by commonly used methods like ordination and anova. Total beta can be partitioned into Species Contributions (SCBD: degree of variation of individual species across the study area) and Local Contributions (LCBD: comparative indicators of the ecological uniqueness of the sites) to Beta Diversity. Moreover, total beta can be broken up into within- and among-group components by manova, into orthogonal axes by ordination, into spatial scales by eigenfunction analysis or among explanatory data sets by variation partitioning.},

	abstract = {Aim To explore the effects of the introduction of exotic and translocated species and possible future extirpation of native species on the functional diversity (FD) of freshwater fish assemblages. Location Japanese archipelago. Methods We examined spatio-temporal changes in species richness, FD, functional richness (the number of trait-based functional groups), and the functional group composition between historical and current fish assemblages for 27 eco-regions, and compared the relative effects of the introduction of exotic and translocated species on FD. We also used a null model approach to determine the assembly patterns and the extent of functional redundancy. Finally, we determined the effect of the loss of endangered species on FD by comparing the observed losses with simulated random loss. Results Through the introductions of non-native species, the species richness, FD and functional richness of the fish assemblages increased 2.4-, 1.6- and 2.1-fold, respectively. The functional group composition also changed largely through the additions of new functional groups. Exotic species had a significantly greater effect size than translocated species, but there were no differences in the overall net effects of exotic and translocated species. Null modelling approaches showed that the observed FD was higher than expected by chance (i.e. trait divergent) in both historical and current assemblages. There was also low functional redundancy. In our simulation, FD decreased in proportion to the loss of species, independent of whether the species were endangered. Main conclusions We demonstrated that both exotic and translocated species may change FD and functional group composition, which might have dramatic consequences for ecosystem processes. We suggest that the future extirpation of even a few native species can cause a substantial loss of FD. Our findings emphasize the need to improve conservation strategies based on species richness and conservation status, and to incorporate translocated species into targets of the management of non-native species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Riparian habitats are subjected to frequent inundation (flooding) and are characterised by food webs that exhibit variability in aquatic/terrestrial subsidies across the ecotone. The strength of this subsidy in active riparian floodplains is thought to underpin local biodiversity. Terrestrial invertebrates dominate the fauna, exhibiting traits that allow exploitation of variable aquatic subsidies while reducing inundation pressures, leading to inter-species micro-spatial positioning. The effect these strategies have on prey selection is not known. This study hypothesised that plasticity in prey choice from either aquatic or terrestrial sources is an important trait linked to inundation tolerance and avoidance. METHOD/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used hydrological, isotopic and habitat analyses to investigate the diet of riparian Coleoptera in relation to inundation risk and relative spatial positioning in the floodplain. The study examined patch scale and longitudinal changes in utilisation of the aquatic subsidy according to species traits. Prey sourced from terrestrial or emerging/stranded aquatic invertebrates varied in relation to traits for inundation avoidance or tolerance strategies. Traits that favoured rapid dispersal corresponded with highest proportions of aquatic prey, with behavioural traits further predicting uptake. Less able dispersers showed minimal use of aquatic subsidy and switched to a terrestrial diet under moderate inundation pressures. All trait groups showed a seasonal shift in diet towards terrestrial prey in the early spring. Prey selection became exaggerated towards aquatic prey in downstream samples. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that partitioning of resources and habitat creates overlapping niches that increase the processing of external subsidies in riparian habitats. By demonstrating functional complexity, this work advances understanding of floodplain ecosystem processes and highlights the importance of hydrological variability. With an increasing interest in reconnecting rivers to their floodplains, these invertebrates represent a key functional element in ensuring that such reconnections have demonstrable ecological value.},

Commonly applied statistical tools cannot quantitatively estimate these processes, nor identify abiotic features that impose these processes. For interrogation of subsurface microbial communities distributed across two geologically distinct formations of the unconfined aquifer underlying the Hanford Site in southeastern Washington State, we developed an analytical framework that advances ecological understanding in two primary ways. First, we quantitatively estimate influences of Drift, Selection and Dispersal. Second, ecological patterns are used to characterize measured and unmeasured abiotic variables that impose Selection or that result in low levels of Dispersal. We find that (i) Drift alone consistently governs ∼25\% of spatial turnover in community composition; (ii) in deeper, finer-grained sediments, Selection is strong (governing ∼60\% of turnover), being imposed by an unmeasured but spatially structured environmental variable; (iii) in shallower, coarser-grained sediments, Selection is weaker (governing ∼30\% of turnover), being imposed by vertically and horizontally structured hydrological factors;(iv) low levels of Dispersal can govern nearly 30\% of turnover and be caused primarily by spatial isolation resulting from limited exchange between finer and coarser-grain sediments; and (v) highly permeable sediments are associated with high levels of Dispersal that homogenize community composition and govern over 20\% of turnover. We further show that our framework provides inferences that cannot be achieved using preexisting approaches, and suggest that their broad application will facilitate a unified understanding of microbial communities.},

Here, we investigated direct and indirect effects of habitat connectivity on populations of invasive bullfrogs and native wrinkled frogs and how these effects are modified by the presence of common carp, a resident shared predator, in a farm pond system in Japan. The distribution pattern analysis using a hierarchical Bayesian modelling indicated that bullfrogs had negative effects on wrinkled frogs, and that these negative effects were enhanced with increasing habitat connectivity owing to the metapopulation structure of bullfrogs. The analysis also suggested that common carp mitigated these impacts, presumably owing to a top-down trophic cascade through preferential predation on bullfrog tadpoles. These presumed interspecific interactions were supported by evidence from laboratory experiments, i.e. predation by carp was more intense on bullfrog tadpoles than on wrinkled frog tadpoles owing to the difference in refuge use. Our results indicate that metacommunity perspectives could provide useful insights for establishing effective management strategies of invasive species living in patchy habitats.},

However, diversity–stability relationships (DSRs) are analysed using a variety of different population and community properties, most of which are adopted from theory that makes several restrictive assumptions that are unlikely to be reflected in nature. Here, we construct a simple synthesis and generalisation of previous theory for the DSR. We show that community stability is a product of two quantities: the synchrony of population fluctuations, and an average species-level population stability that is weighted by relative abundance. Weighted average population stability can be decomposed to consider effects of the mean-variance scaling of abundance, changes in mean abundance with diversity and differences in species' mean abundance in monoculture. Our framework makes explicit how unevenness in the abundances of species in real communities influences the DSR, which occurs both through effects on community synchrony, and effects on weighted average population variability. This theory provides a more robust framework for analysing the results of empirical studies of the DSR, and facilitates the integration of findings from real and model communities.},

We characterised aquatic food webs using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes from 66 river and floodplain sites across the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia to determine the relative importance of productivity (indicated by nutrient concentrations), disturbance (indicated by hydrological isolation) and ecosystem size, and how they may be affected by food web architecture. We show that variation in food chain length was unrelated to these classic environmental determinants, and unrelated to the trophic role of the top predator. This finding is a striking exception to the literature and is the first published example of food chain length being unaffected by any of these determinants. We suggest the distinctive seasonal hydrology of northern Australia allows the movement of fish predators, linking isolated food webs and potentially creating a regional food web that overrides local effects of productivity, disturbance and ecosystem size. This finding supports ecological theory suggesting that mobile consumers promote more stable food webs. It also illustrates how food webs, and energy transfer, may function in the absence of the human modifications to landscape hydrological connectivity that are ubiquitous in more populated regions.},

	abstract = {Habitat fragmentation and land use changes are causing major biodiversity losses. Connectivity of the landscape or environmental conditions alone can shape biodiversity patterns. In nature, however, local habitat characteristics are often intrinsically linked to a specific connectivity. Such a link is evident in riverine ecosystems, where hierarchical dendritic structures command related scaling on habitat capacity. We experimentally disentangled the effect of local habitat capacity (i.e., the patch size) and dendritic connectivity on biodiversity in aquatic microcosm metacommunities by suitably arranging patch sizes within river-like networks. Overall, more connected communities that occupy a central position in the network exhibited higher species richness, irrespective of patch size arrangement. High regional evenness in community composition was found only in landscapes preserving geomorphological scaling properties of patch sizes. In these landscapes, some of the rarer species sustained regionally more abundant populations better tracking their own niche requirements compared to landscapes with homogeneous patch size or landscapes with spatially uncorrelated patch size. Our analysis suggests that altering the natural link between dendritic connectivity and patch size strongly affects community composition and population persistence at multiple scales. The experimental results are demonstrating a principle that can be tested in theoretical metacommunity models and eventually be projected to real riverine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are central aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods of estimating biological diversity from sampling data have been elusive. Hill numbers, or the effective number of species, are increasingly used to characterize the taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity of an assemblage. However, empirical estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to be an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to increase with sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation) standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill number qD, where q = 0) to measures of taxon diversity incorporating relative abundance (i.e., for any Hill number qD, q {\textgreater} 0) and present a unified approach for both individual-based (abundance) data and sample-based (incidence) data. Using this unified sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and extrapolation based on Hill numbers. Detailed examples are provided for the first three Hill numbers: q = 0 (species richness), q = 1 (the exponential of Shannon's entropy index), and q = 2 (the inverse of Simpson's concentration index). We developed a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of multiple assemblages of both rarefied and extrapolated samples. The proposed estimators are accurate for both rarefaction and short-range extrapolation. For long-range extrapolation, the performance of the estimators depends on both the value of q and on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated data generated from species abundance models and on data from large species inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and estimators using empirical data sets from biodiversity surveys of temperate forest spiders and tropical ants.},

	abstract = {The perceived threat of climate change is often evaluated from species distribution models that are fitted to many species independently and then added together. This approach ignores the fact that species are jointly distributed and limit one another. Species respond to the same underlying climatic variables, and the abundance of any one species can be constrained by competition; a large increase in one is inevitably linked to declines of others. Omitting this basic relationship explains why responses modeled independently do not agree with the species richness or basal areas of actual forests. We introduce a joint species distribution modeling approach (JSDM), which is unique in three ways, and apply it to forests of eastern North America. First, it accommodates the joint distribution of species. Second, this joint distribution includes both abundance and presence–absence data. We solve the common issue of large numbers of zeros in abundance data by accommodating zeros in both stem counts and basal area data, i.e., a new approach to zero inflation. Finally, inverse prediction can be applied to the joint distribution of predictions to integrate the role of climate risks across all species and identify geographic areas where communities will change most (in terms of changes in abundance) with climate change. Application to forests in the eastern United States shows that climate can have greatest impact in the Northeast, due to temperature, and in the Upper Midwest, due to temperature and precipitation. Thus, these are the regions experiencing the fastest warming and are also identified as most responsive at this scale.},

Methods Using distribution maps of canopy-statured individuals, we evaluated patterns of habitat association in five tropical tree species on Barro Colorado Island across a wide range of sampling scales (from 50 to 1600 ha). We investigated the scale-dependency of species clumping patterns (Ripley's K) and the association of species distributions with important environmental variables (forest age, topography and geological formation) using point pattern analyses. Results Clump size and clump density had high variances within and among spatial scales. Significant habitat associations were found in all five species, with the number of habitat associations generally increasing with the sampling scale. Ignoring dispersal constraints inflated the number of significant habitat associations. Conclusions We found that patterns of habitat association (and hence conclusions on the importance of niche vs neutral processes) are strongly affected by the choice of sampling scale and location.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} An analytical theory is developed that obtains Horton laws for six hydraulic–geometric (H–G) variables (stream discharge \textit{Q}, width \textit{W}, depth \textit{D}, velocity \textit{U}, slope \textit{S}, and friction \textit{n'}) in self-similar Tokunaga networks in the limit of a large network order. The theory uses several disjoint theoretical concepts like Horton laws of stream numbers and areas as asymptotic relations in Tokunaga networks, dimensional analysis, the Buckingham Pi theorem, asymptotic self-similarity of the first kind, or SS-1, and asymptotic self-similarity of the second kind, or SS-2. A self-contained review of these concepts, with examples, is given as "methods". The H–G data sets in channel networks from three published studies and one unpublished study are summarized to test theoretical predictions. The theory builds on six independent \textit{dimensionless river-basin numbers}. A mass conservation equation in terms of Horton bifurcation and discharge ratios in Tokunaga networks is derived. Assuming that the H–G variables are homogeneous and self-similar functions of stream discharge, it is shown that the functions are of a power law form. SS-1 is applied to predict the Horton laws for width, depth and velocity as asymptotic relationships. Exponents of width and the Reynolds number are predicted and tested against three field data sets. One basin shows deviations from theoretical predictions. Tentatively assuming that SS-1 is valid for slope, depth and velocity, corresponding Horton laws and the H–G exponents are derived. Our predictions of the exponents are the same as those previously predicted for the optimal channel network (OCN) model. In direct contrast to our work, the OCN model does not consider Horton laws for the H–G variables, and uses optimality assumptions. The predicted exponents deviate substantially from the values obtained from three field studies, which suggests that H–G in networks does not obey SS-1. It fails because slope, a dimensionless river-basin number, goes to 0 as network order increases, but, it cannot be eliminated from the asymptotic limit. Therefore, a generalization of SS-1, based on SS-2, is considered. It introduces two anomalous scaling exponents as free parameters, which enables us to show the existence of Horton laws for channel depth, velocity, slope and Manning friction. These two exponents are not predicted here. Instead, we used the observed exponents of depth and slope to predict the Manning friction exponent and to test it against field exponents from three studies. The same basin mentioned above shows some deviation from the theoretical prediction. A physical reason for this deviation is given, which identifies an important topic for research. Finally, we briefly sketch how the two anomalous scaling exponents could be estimated from the transport of suspended sediment load and the bed load. Statistical variability in the Horton laws for the H–G variables is also discussed. Both are important open problems for future research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Understanding the processes determining community structure is one of the major goals of ecological research. Both deterministic and stochastic processes may shape community structure. The challenge is to understand the relative influence of each type of process across different environmental conditions. We investigated the influence of deterministic and stochastic processes on plant community assembly in tidal marshes across a strong abiotic (salinity) gradient in three estuaries in Georgia, USA using probabilistic Raup–Crick community dissimilarity. Our results indicated that deterministic processes had an increasingly important influence on structuring plant communities in salt and brackish marshes, probably due to high heterogeneity of microhabitats produced by the interplay between abiotic stress and biotic interactions. In contrast, the influence of deterministic processes on plant community assembly decreased in tidal freshwater marshes, suggesting an increasingly important role of stochastic processes in plant community assembly in tidal freshwater marshes, probably due to the higher species richness, higher recruitment from seed, and lower levels of abiotic stress in these habitats. At the estuarine scale (across tidal freshwater, brackish and salt marshes in each estuary), our results suggested that deterministic processes also had a relatively important influence on shaping plant community structure. Our results illustrated that plant community structure in tidal marshes is influenced by both deterministic and stochastic processes, but that the relative influence of these two types of processes varies across estuarine landscapes.},

	abstract = {Taylor's law, one of the most widely accepted generalizations in ecology, states that the variance of a population abundance time series scales as a power law of its mean. Here we reexamine this law and the empirical evidence presented in support of it. Specifically, we show that the exponent generally depends on the length of the time series, and its value reflects the combined effect of many underlying mechanisms. Moreover, sampling errors alone, when presented on a double logarithmic scale, are sufficient to produce an apparent power law. This raises questions regarding the usefulness of Taylor's law for understanding ecological processes. As an alternative approach, we focus on short-term fluctuations and derive a generic null model for the variance-to-mean ratio in population time series from a demographic model that incorporates the combined effects of demographic and environmental stochasticity. After comparing the predictions of the proposed null model with the fluctuations observed in empirical data sets, we suggest an alternative expression for fluctuation scaling in population time series. Analyzing population fluctuations as we have proposed here may provide new applied (e.g., estimation of species persistence times) and theoretical (e.g., the neutral theory of biodiversity) insights that can be derived from more generally available short-term monitoring data.},

While neutral models have since been applied to a broad range of ecological and macroecological phenomena, the majority of research relating to neutral theory has focused exclusively on the species abundance distribution (SAD). Here, we synthesize the large body of work on neutral theory in the context of the species abundance distribution, with a particular focus on integrating ideas from neutral theory with traditional niche theory. First, we summarize the basic tenets of neutral theory; both in general and in the context of SADs. Second, we explore the issues associated with neutral theory and the SAD, such as complications with fitting and model comparison, the underlying assumptions of neutral models, and the difficultly of linking pattern to process. Third, we highlight the advances in understanding of SADs that have resulted from neutral theory and models. Finally, we focus consideration on recent developments aimed at unifying neutral- and niche-based approaches to ecology, with a particular emphasis on what this means for SAD theory, embracing, for instance, ideas of emergent neutrality and stochastic niche theory. We put forward the argument that the prospect of the unification of niche and neutral perspectives represents one of the most promising future avenues of neutral theory research.},

	abstract = {The effects of habitat connectivity on food webs have been studied both empirically and theoretically, yet the question of whether empirical results support theoretical predictions for any food web metric other than species richness has received little attention. Our synthesis brings together theory and empirical evidence for how habitat connectivity affects both food web stability and complexity. Food web stability is often predicted to be greatest at intermediate levels of connectivity, representing a compromise between the stabilizing effects of dispersal via rescue effects and prey switching, and the destabilizing effects of dispersal via regional synchronization of population dynamics. Empirical studies of food web stability generally support both this pattern and underlying mechanisms. Food chain length has been predicted to have both increasing and unimodal relationships with connectivity as a result of predators being constrained by the patch occupancy of their prey. Although both patterns have been documented empirically, the underlying mechanisms may differ from those predicted by models. In terms of other measures of food web complexity, habitat connectivity has been empirically found to generally increase link density but either reduce or have no effect on connectance, whereas a unimodal relationship is expected. In general, there is growing concordance between empirical patterns and theoretical predictions for some effects of habitat connectivity on food webs, but many predictions remain to be tested over a full connectivity gradient, and empirical metrics of complexity are rarely modeled. Closing these gaps will allow a deeper understanding of how natural and anthropogenic changes in connectivity can affect real food webs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Naturally occurring coinfections of pathogens have been reported in salmonids, but their consequences on disease resistance are unclear. We hypothesized that 1) coinfection of Caligus rogercresseyi reduces the resistance of Atlantic salmon to Piscirickettsia salmonis; and 2) coinfection resistance is a heritable trait that does not correlate with resistance to a single infection. METHODOLOGY: In total, 1,634 pedigreed Atlantic salmon were exposed to a single infection (SI) of P. salmonis (primary pathogen) or coinfection with C. rogercresseyi (secondary pathogen). Low and high level of coinfection were evaluated (LC = 44 copepodites per fish; HC = 88 copepodites per fish). Survival and quantitative genetic analyses were performed to determine the resistance to the single infection and coinfections. MAIN FINDINGS: C. rogercresseyi significantly increased the mortality in fish infected with P. salmonis (SI mortality = 251/545; LC mortality = 544/544 and HC mortality = 545/545). Heritability estimates for resistance to P. salmonis were similar and of medium magnitude in all treatments (h2SI = 0.23 +/- 0.07; h2LC = 0.17 +/- 0.08; h2HC = 0.24 +/- 0.07). A large and significant genetic correlation with regard to resistance was observed between coinfection treatments (rg LC-HC = 0.99 +/- 0.01) but not between the single and coinfection treatments (rg SI-LC = -0.14 +/- 0.33; rg SI-HC = 0.32 +/- 0.34). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: C. rogercresseyi, as a secondary pathogen, reduces the resistance of Atlantic salmon to the pathogen P. salmonis. Resistance to coinfection of Piscirickettsia salmonis and Caligus rogercresseyi in Atlantic salmon is a heritable trait. The absence of a genetic correlation between resistance to a single infection and resistance to coinfection indicates that different genes control these processes. Coinfection of different pathogens and resistance to coinfection needs to be considered in future research on salmon farming, selective breeding and conservation.},

	abstract = {A primary goal of ecology is to understand the fundamental processes underlying the geographic distributions of species. Two major strands of ecology – habitat modelling and community ecology – approach this problem differently. Habitat modellers often use species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify the relationship between species’ and their environments without considering potential biotic interactions. Community ecologists, on the other hand, tend to focus on biotic interactions and, in observational studies, use co-occurrence patterns to identify ecological processes. Here, we describe a joint species distribution model (JSDM) that integrates these distinct observational approaches by incorporating species co-occurrence data into a SDM. JSDMs estimate distributions of multiple species simultaneously and allow decomposition of species co-occurrence patterns into components describing shared environmental responses and residual patterns of co-occurrence. We provide a general description of the model, a tutorial and code for fitting the model in R. We demonstrate this modelling approach using two case studies: frogs and eucalypt trees in Victoria, Australia. Overall, shared environmental correlations were stronger than residual correlations for both frogs and eucalypts, but there were cases of strong residual correlation. Frog species generally had positive residual correlations, possibly due to the fact these species occurred in similar habitats that were not fully described by the environmental variables included in the JSDM. Eucalypt species that interbreed had similar environmental responses but had negative residual co-occurrence. One explanation is that interbreeding species may not form stable assemblages despite having similar environmental affinities. Environmental and residual correlations estimated from JSDMs can help indicate whether co-occurrence is driven by shared environmental responses or other ecological or evolutionary process (e.g. biotic interactions), or if important predictor variables are missing. JSDMs take into account the fact that distributions of species might be related to each other and thus overcome a major limitation of modelling species distributions independently.},

	abstract = {Temperature-driven life-history modifications by adaptation occur in ectotherms, and therefore, life-history modifications by adaptation need to be taken into consideration when predicting population responses to the climate change. Partial migration is a common form of life-history diversity in which a population contains both migratory and resident behaviours. Salmonid fish exhibit a wide range of life-history diversity and, in particular, partial migration. We evaluated the effect of temperature-driven life-history modifications on population dynamics in partially migratory masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) by field observations and theoretical models. Field observations revealed that spatial patterns of alternative migratory tactics were associated with temperature gradients. The occurrence of resident males increased, whereas the proportion of migrant males and the proportion of delayed migrants including both sexes decreased with increasing temperature and, thereby, with improved early growth conditions. The expected fitness for each migratory tactic was computed in a life-history model with early growth conditions as a function. Individual fitness was maximized by adopting resident tactics under favourable early growth conditions, early migrant tactics under intermediate early growth conditions and delayed migrant tactics under unfavourable early growth conditions. The results suggest that individuals exhibited a status-dependent conditional strategy, that is, the adoption of alternative migratory tactics is influenced by the status of individuals to make the best of a situation. A simulation model suggests that increased residency by males to increased temperature leads to a substantial decrease in the number of migrants. Moreover, the decrease in the number of delayed (older) migrants with increasing temperature magnified fluctuations in abundance. Our findings indicate the importance of temperature-driven life-history modifications for predicting dynamics of natural populations under climate warming.},

In this study, we investigated experimentally the effect of artificial light on flying insects in the field, with an emphasis on aquatic insects. We asked whether lights prevented the ability of insects to disperse across the landscape, a process that is crucial in colonising restored habitats. We set up six, c. 3.5 m high downward facing high-pressure sodium streetlights along a permanently connected oxbow in the Spree River of eastern Germany. We collected insects using 12 flight intercept traps, each with trays at three different heights (0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 m), placed at distances 0, 3, 40 and 75 m from the lights and 5, 8 and 80 m from water. The number of emerging aquatic insects in the study area was measured with six emergence traps. We emptied the traps 22 times between June and September 2010; the lights were on for 11 of these nights and off for the other 11. In total, we caught almost 27 times as many insects at traps 0 m from the lights when the lights were on than when they were off. Most insects caught when the lights were on were aquatic, with Diptera being the most common order. Furthermore, the proportion of aquatic insects caught at traps 0, 3 and 40 m from the lights when they were on was significantly higher than when they were off. On lit nights, more aquatic insects were captured per hour and m2 (area in which flying insects were intercepted) at traps 0 m from the lights than emerged from per square metre per hour from the Spree River. Our results suggest that adult aquatic insects can be negatively affected by artificial light and that city planners should take this into account when designing lighting systems along rivers.},

	abstract = {Rivers in watersheds dominated by agriculture throughout the US are impaired by excess sediment, a significant portion of which comes from non-field, near-channel sources. Both land-use and climate have been implicated in altering river flows and thereby increasing stream-channel erosion and sediment loading. In the wetland-rich landscapes of the upper Mississippi basin, 20th century crop conversions have led to an intensification of artificial drainage, which is now a critical component of modern agriculture. At the same time, much of the region has experienced increased annual rainfall. Uncertainty in separating these drivers of streamflow fuels debate between agricultural and environmental interests on responsibility and solutions for excess riverine sediment. To disentangle the effects of climate and land-use, we compared changes in precipitation, crop conversions, and extent of drained depressional area in 21 Minnesota watersheds over the past 70 years. Watersheds with large land-use changes had increases in seasonal and annual water yields of {\textgreater}50\% since 1940. On average, changes in precipitation and crop evapotranspiration explained less than one-half of the increase, with the remainder highly correlated with artificial drainage and loss of depressional areas. Rivers with increased flow have experienced channel widening of 10–40\% highlighting a source of sediment seldom addressed by agricultural best management practices.

	abstract = {Understanding the consequences of realistic species loss on the functioning and persistence of vulnerable ecosystems is key to devising conservation strategies when environmental changes are immediate threats. Yet, few studies have provided direct evidence for conservation prioritization and decision-making. We incorporated the quantification of functional diversity based on the Rao index of diversity (FDrao) into this applied context and examined the consequences of realistic species loss on functional diversity in moorland plant communities widely interspersed within a subalpine zone in northern Japan. The realistic order of species loss was derived from the nested subset pattern in the moorland communities, which was corroborated by selective species tolerance and selective extinction. We analysed the relationships between the FDrao half-life, as an index of each moorland's vulnerability to species loss, and a range of environmental variables describing the moorlands. We then mapped this index across the entire landscape. At most sites, ordered species loss caused a relatively small decline in FDrao until a certain number of species was lost and an accelerating decline thereafter, suggesting relatively low initial vulnerability to species loss. At the other sites, however, ordered species loss caused an approximately proportional decrease in FDrao, suggesting relatively high vulnerability to species loss. The model indicated that sites with higher elevation, higher carrying capacities, or increasing isolation have a shorter FDrao half-life. The mapping of this index allowed us to identify the geographical distribution of sites of high conservation priority. Synthesis and applications. We performed fine-scale assessments of the vulnerability of moorland plant communities to species loss, which is likely to occur under future environmental conditions, by simulating the consequences of realistic species loss for functional diversity. The methods used here can provide urgently needed information to support the prioritization and decision-making involved in conserving ecosystems in the face of global biodiversity loss.},

	abstract = {Spatial autocorrelation is a well-recognized concern for observational data in general, and more specifically for spatial data in ecology. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with spatially autocorrelated random effects are a potential general framework for handling these spatial correlations. However, as the result of statistical and practical issues, such GLMMs have been fitted through the undocumented use of procedures based on penalized quasi-likelihood approximations (PQL), and under restrictive models of spatial correlation. Alternatively, they are often neglected in favor of simpler but more questionable approaches. In this work we aim to provide practical and validated means of inference under spatial GLMMs, that overcome these limitations. For this purpose, a new software is developed to fit spatial GLMMs. We use it to assess the performance of likelihood ratio tests for fixed effects under spatial autocorrelation, based on Laplace or PQL approximations of the likelihood. Expectedly, the Laplace approximation performs generally slightly better, although a variant of PQL was better in the binary case. We show that a previous implementation of PQL methods in the R language, glmmPQL, is not appropriate for such applications. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency of a bootstrap procedure for correcting the small sample bias of the tests, which applies also to non-spatial models.},

We examined movement patterns of Masu Salmon (Oncorhynchus masou masou), the obligate host ﬁsh for the freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera laevis, during the mussel’s parasitic period to determine the dispersal potential of glochidia via host ﬁsh in the Shubuto River system, Hokkaido, Japan. We conducted a mark–recapture study in a 650-m river section to describe the distance and directionality of host ﬁsh movement, and we used fyke net sampling to quantify the number of host ﬁsh moving from mainstem rivers to tributaries. Most individuals of Masu Salmon captured in the study were infected with glochidia of M. laevis. The displacement distance of infected ﬁshes ranged from 37.5 m downstream to 512.5 m upstream (mean = 36.5 m upstream from marking location). The dispersal kernel based on a diﬀusion–advection model represented a leptokurtic distribution with a fat-tailed upstream bias, but most recaptured ﬁsh remained near the initial capture location. Movement of ﬁsh from mainstem rivers to tributaries was strongly aﬀected by diﬀerences in water temperature among tributaries. Most individuals moved to cooler tributaries, but tributaries did not support populations of M. laevis. These results suggest that glochidial dispersal via host ﬁsh is important for local recruitment and upstream dispersal, but dispersal to tributaries may be a source of mortality for M. laevis.},

However, little is known of how asymmetric dispersal influences riverine population structure and dynamics, limiting our ability to properly manage riverine organisms. A metapopulation of the freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera laevis may be sensitive to river currents because mussels are repeatedly exposed to downstream drift during floods-a parasitic life stage is the only, limited period ( approximately 40 days) during which larvae (glochidia) can move upstream with the aid of host fish. We hypothesized that water-mediated dispersal would overwhelm upstream dispersal via host fish, and therefore, that upstream subpopulations play a critical role as immigrant sources. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of both up- and downstream immigrant sources on the size of target subpopulations in the Shubuto River system, Hokkaido, Japan. We found that target subpopulation size was dependent on the upstream distribution range of reproductive subpopulations and the number of upstream tributaries, which are proxies for the number of potential immigrants moving downstream. In contrast, little influence was observed of downstream immigrant sources (proximity to downstream reproductive subpopulations). These results were consistent even after accounting for local environments and stream size. Our finding suggests that upstream subpopulations can be disproportionately important as immigrant sources when dispersal is strongly asymmetric.},

	abstract = {Hydrology in many agricultural landscapes around the world is changing in unprecedented ways due to the development of extensive surface and subsurface drainage systems that optimize productivity. This plumbing of the landscape alters water pathways, timings, and storage, creating new regimes of hydrologic response and driving a chain of environmental changes in sediment dynamics, nutrient cycling, and river ecology. In this work, we nonparametrically quantify the nature of hydrologic change in the Minnesota River Basin, an intensively managed agricultural landscape, and study how this change might modulate ecological transitions. During the growing season when climate effects are shown to be minimal, daily streamflow hydrographs exhibit sharper rising limbs and stronger dependence on the previous-day precipitation. We also find a changed storage-discharge relationship and show that the artificial landscape connectivity has most drastically affected the rainfall-runoff relationship at intermediate quantiles. Considering the whole year, we show that the combined climate and land use change effects reduce the inherent nonlinearity in the dynamics of daily streamflow, perhaps reflecting a more linearized engineered hydrologic system. Using a simplified dynamic interaction model that couples hydrology to river ecology, we demonstrate how the observed hydrologic change and/or the discharge-driven sediment generation dynamics may have modulated a regime shift in river ecology, namely extirpation of native mussel populations. We posit that such nonparametric analyses and reduced complexity modeling can provide more insight than highly parameterized models and can guide development of vulnerability assessments and integrated watershed management frameworks.},

The current equilibrium theory cannot explain the transient dynamics of SAD, which is essential for predicting biodiversity response to environmental changes. Using a unique 32-yr-long phytoplankton community data set from a pelagic site of Lake Biwa, Japan, we show that the dynamics of functional groups driven by environmental variation explain the excess of rare species over time. First, most of the rare species belong to the littoral group supplied through dispersal, whereas the common species belong to the pelagic group. Second, the littoral group was negatively influenced by environmental changes (i.e., lake warming, water-level manipulation, and partial re-oligotrophication), mechanistically explaining truncation of the excess of rare species in the SAD associated with biodiversity loss in Lake Biwa. Our findings imply the significance of an ecological trait-based approach for SAD theory and managing biodiversity in a changing environment.},

Two linked components of stability have large consequences for persistence: first, statistical stability as the lack of temporal fluctuations; second, synchronisation as an aspect of dynamic stability, which erodes metapopulation rescue effects. Here, we determine the influence of river network structure on the stability of riverine metapopulations. We introduce an approach that converts river networks to metapopulation networks, and analytically show how fluctuation magnitude is influenced by interaction structure. We show that river metapopulation complexity (in terms of branching prevalence) has nonlinear dampening effects on population fluctuations, and can also buffer against synchronisation. We conclude by showing that river transects generally increase synchronisation, while the spatial scale of interaction has nonlinear effects on synchronised dynamics. Our results indicate that this dual stability – conferred by fluctuation and synchronisation dampening – emerges from interaction structure in rivers, and this may strongly influence the persistence of river metapopulations.},

	abstract = {Infectious diseases of humans, wildlife, and domesticated species are increasing worldwide, driving the need to understand the mechanisms that shape outbreaks. Simultaneously, human activities are drastically reducing biodiversity. These concurrent patterns have prompted repeated suggestions that biodiversity and disease are linked. For example, the dilution effect hypothesis posits that these patterns are causally related; diverse host communities inhibit the spread of parasites via several mechanisms, such as by regulating populations of susceptible hosts or interfering with parasite transmission. However, the generality of the dilution effect hypothesis remains controversial, especially for zoonotic diseases of humans. Here we provide broad evidence that host diversity inhibits parasite abundance using a meta-analysis of 202 effect sizes on 61 parasite species. The magnitude of these effects was independent of host density, study design, and type and specialization of parasites, indicating that dilution was robust across all ecological contexts examined. However, the magnitude of dilution was more closely related to the frequency, rather than density, of focal host species. Importantly, observational studies overwhelmingly documented dilution effects, and there was also significant evidence for dilution effects of zoonotic parasites of humans. Thus, dilution effects occur commonly in nature, and they may modulate human disease risk. A second analysis identified similar effects of diversity in plant-herbivore systems. Thus, although there can be exceptions, our results indicate that biodiversity generally decreases parasitism and herbivory. Consequently, anthropogenic declines in biodiversity could increase human and wildlife diseases and decrease crop and forest production.},

There is no consensus over which model is correct, because the degree to which different processes can be discerned from SAD patterns has not yet been rigorously quantified. We present a power calculation to quantify our ability to detect deviations from neutrality using species abundance data. We study non-neutral stochastic community models, and show that the presence of non-neutral processes is detectable if sample size is large enough and/or the amplitude of the effect is strong enough. Our framework can be used for any candidate community model that can be simulated on a computer, and determines both the sampling effort required to distinguish between alternative processes, and a range for the strength of non-neutral processes in communities whose patterns are statistically consistent with neutral theory. We find that even data sets of the scale of the 50 Ha forest plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, are unlikely to be large enough to detect deviations from neutrality caused by competitive interactions alone, though the presence of multiple non-neutral processes with contrasting effects on abundance distributions may be detectable.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) represent important analytical and predictive tools for ecologists. Until now, these models have either assumed (i) that species' occurrence probabilities are uncorrelated or (ii) that species respond linearly to preselected environmental variables. These two assumptions currently prevent ecologists from modelling assemblages with realistic co-occurrence and species richness properties. This paper introduces a stochastic feedforward neural network, called ‘mistnet’, which makes neither assumption. Thus, unlike most SDMs, mistnet can account for non-independent co-occurrence patterns driven by unobserved environmental heterogeneity. And unlike several recently proposed joint SDMs, the model can also learn nonlinear functions relating species' occurrence probabilities to environmental predictors. Mistnet makes more accurate predictions about the North American bird communities found along Breeding Bird Survey transects than several alternative methods tested. In particular, typical assemblages held out of sample for validation were each tens of thousands of times more likely under the mistnet model than under independent combinations of single-species predictions. Apart from improved accuracy, mistnet shows two other important benefits for ecological research and management. First: by analysing co-occurrence data, mistnet can identify unmeasured – and perhaps unanticipated – environmental variables that drive species turnover. For example, the model identified a strong grassland/forest gradient, even though only temperature and precipitation were given as model inputs. Second: mistnet is able to take advantage of outside information to guide its predictions towards more realistic assemblages. For example, mistnet automatically adjusts its expectations to include more forest-associated species in response to a stray observation of a forest-dwelling warbler.},

	abstract = {Urbanization alters the environmental characteristics of aquatic ecosystems, often reducing the availability and quality of habitats for animals. Improving the condition of urban waterbodies is increasingly important, but management activities could have unintended outcomes that increase the extinction risk for animals. A mismatch can exist between human perceptions of habitat quality, and what represents functional habitats for animals. This can lead to animals not responding to management activities, if presumed high-quality habitats are unsuitable. More seriously, the fitness of animals could be compromised by management activities, especially if animals prefer threatening habitats resulting in an ecological trap. Ecological traps can drive populations to extinction and may arise directly from management activities. However, there has been limited work on how to best manage traps despite their important implications for the conservation and management of animal populations. We illustrate how urban management activities could cause ecological traps, and potential ways that traps could be managed. We outline a decision framework to identify, prevent and mitigate ecological traps, and illustrate this framework using stormwater wetlands as a case study. Stormwater wetlands have many features of natural wetlands but accumulate pollutants as part of the stormwater treatment process and there is a high likelihood some are traps. If so, this will be an important environmental issue, given the rate at which these wetlands are being created around many cities. Synthesis and application. Ecological traps that arise as unintended outcomes of management activities could represent a serious but currently underappreciated environmental problem. Our study will help minimize the risk that management activities inadvertently decouple habitat selection cues from habitat quality, and mitigate the potential consequences for animals when this does occur. This is an important step to ensure that management activities achieve desired ecological outcomes and do not result in unintentional environmental degradation.},

	abstract = {Although many studies have focused on marine resources, few studies have considered the resources of inland fisheries. Inland fishery resources are typically either monitored on the basis of catch data alone or are not assessed quantitatively at all, despite their social, economic, and ecological importance. Because freshwater ecosystems have been severely degraded by human activities, evaluating the trends and current status of fishery resources and assessing their drivers are urgent tasks. We compiled long-term data on the annual catch, fishing effort, and fishing power of 23 Japanese lakes, using two sets of government statistics that date back to the 1950s, which were previously neglected because of the large number of missing values. Using Bayesian state-space models, we examined the trajectories of the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of entire communities, considering changes in fishing effort and fishing power, and quantified both changes in the CPUE over the 10-, 20-, and 30-year periods preceding 2008 and the temporal detrended stability of the CPUE over the three periods. We also investigated the relationships among the CPUE changes and stability, anthropogenic drivers, and lake morphometric characteristics. The CPUE declined in 17, 19, and 15 of the 23 lakes over the past 10-, 20-, and 30-year periods, respectively. Our macroecological analyses demonstrate that the functional group richness of exotic piscivores was the most important predictor of changes in the CPUE among the drivers we considered. The stability of the CPUE was positively related to lake area; larger lakes have more stable CPUE. The functional group richness of exotic piscivores also negatively affected the stability of the CPUE. The effect of overfishing was considered to be small because both fishing effort and power declined in almost all of the lakes. Thus, our findings suggest that increasing exotic piscivore species may diminish the resources and their stability, particularly in Japanese lakes where native piscivores are rare. This might lead to a substantial decline in ecosystem services. Our study highlights the importance of assessing inland fishery resources in a comprehensive manner and the need for restoration strategies to mitigate the effects of exotic piscivores.},

A simulation study and an analysis of an estuarine fish community both clearly demonstrate that our proposed turnover measure offers additional insights relative to spatial context-based metrics.

However, drainage configuration (for example, drainage density, and stream length)—in spite of recent advances demonstrating the significance of catchment structure to habitat and biodiversity of fluvial systems—has yet to be explored in relation to FCL. In this study, we quantified the relative influences of ecosystem size and structure on FCL for linked stream–riparian food webs. At 19 stream reaches distributed within three mountain catchments of northern Idaho, USA, we sampled aquatic and riparian consumers and determined FCL using the naturally abundant stable isotopes 13C and 15N. Food-chain length was then related to reach measures of size and structure using an information-theoretic model selection approach. Model selection was followed by exploratory linear regression of FCL with purported mechanistic factors (that is, resource availability and disturbance regime). FCL ranged from 2.6 to 4.4 across study reaches and was best explained by catchment structure such as number of tributary junctions and distance to nearest downstream confluence. Regression analyses suggested that disturbance regime may mechanistically link number of tributary junctions and FCL, as well as drainage area and FCL. Our results introduce novel evidence that ecosystem structure may integrate the effects of several mechanistic factors and thus be an important predictor of food-web structure.},

Most research is based on short-term small-scale experiments in which behavioural and/or physiological responses prevail. Here, we estimated the time-scales during which density- and trait-mediated effects manifest, as well as the strength of these effects, using an interaction chain with three organisms (deer–plant–butterfly). A hierarchical Bayesian model was performed by using a long-term data set of deer density in the Boso Peninsula, central Japan (where local densities differ spatially and temporally) as well as densities of the swallowtail butterfly Byasa alcinous and its host plant Aristolochia kaempferi. The time-scale effect of deer on plant quantity and quality was estimated according to the degree of carry-over effects. The negative influence on leaf density showed a temporal saturation pattern over the long term, while the positive influence on leaf quality due to resprouting of leaves after deer browsing showed no clear temporal trend. The net indirect effect changed from positive to negative with time, with the negative density-mediated effect becoming prominent in the long term.

	abstract = {Landscape connectivity structure, specifically the dendritic network structure of rivers, is expected to influence community diversity dynamics by altering dispersal patterns, and subsequently the unfolding of species interactions. However, previous comparative and experimental work on dendritic metacommunities has studied diversity mostly from an equilibrium perspective. Here we investigated the effect of dendritic versus linear network structure on local (α-diversity), among (β-diversity) and total (γ-diversity) temporal species community diversity dynamics. Using a combination of microcosm experiments, which allowed for active dispersal of 14 protists and a rotifer species, and numerical analyses, we demonstrate the general importance of spatial network configuration and basic life history tradeoffs as driving factors of different diversity patterns in linear and dendritic systems. We experimentally found that community diversity patterns were shaped by the interaction of dispersal within the networks and local species interactions. Specifically, α-diversity remained higher in dendritic networks over time, especially at highly connected sites. β-diversity was initially greater in linear networks, due to increased dispersal limitation, but became more similar to β-diversity in dendritic networks over time. Comparing the experimental results with a neutral metacommunity model we found that dispersal and network connectivity alone may, to a large extent, explain α- and β-diversity dynamics. However, additional mechanisms, such as variation in carrying capacity and competition–colonization tradeoffs, were needed in the model to capture the detailed temporal diversity dynamics of the experiments, such as a general decline in γ-diversity and long-term dynamics in α-diversity.},

In salmon populations, response diversity and asynchrony have been linked to the stability of their meta-populations and the fisheries that integrate across them. We examined how population diversity influenced response diversity and asynchrony in 42 populations of Chinook salmon from the Fraser River, British Columbia. We examined diversity in the survival responses to large-scale ocean climate variables for populations that differed in life history. Different life-histories responded differently to ocean environmental conditions. For instance, an increase of offshore temperature was associated with decreased survival for a population with ocean rearing juveniles but increased survival for a population with stream rearing juveniles. In a second analysis, we examined asynchrony in abundance between populations, which we then correlated with life history, spatial, and genetic diversity. Populations that were more genetically distant had the most different population dynamics. Collectively, these results suggest that fine-scale population diversity can contribute to the asynchrony and response diversity that underpins the stability of fisheries or metapopulation dynamics, and emphasize the need to manage and conserve this scale of population diversity.},

	abstract = {Aim Approaches to calculating beta diversity (β) include classical measures based on alpha (α) and gamma (γ) diversity, and multivariate distance-based measures. Species–area relationships cause measurements of γ to vary, making comparisons of classical β among regions contingent on sampling effort. A recent null-modelling approach has attempted to account for variation in γ by calculating the degree to which β deviates from a random expectation. Here, we clarify the mathematical links between classical and multivariate approaches to measuring β, to derive predictions regarding the reliability of classical, null-model and multivariate approaches. Next, we use four ecological datasets and simulated data to test the consistency of these approaches across sampling effort and γ. We focus on an issue that arises when making comparisons among regions, namely that even small changes to the area sampled can differentially increase measured γ in each region, potentially causing artefacts in β that are driven by methodology rather than biology. Innovation Comparisons among regions using classical and null-model measures change dramatically as sampling effort and γ increase. This change is understood for classical β because of species–area relationships, but not for null-model measures, making comparisons among regions impossible using the null-model approach. Multiple-site dissimilarity shows a similar sensitivity to γ as classical measures. In contrast, pairwise multivariate distances show no systematic effect of sampling effort and γ: increasing the number of sample plots decreases variability but does not alter mean β. Main conclusions Multivariate pairwise distances are independent of sample size, offering the most robust comparison among regions. The widespread influence of sampling effort and γ indicate that only scale-dependent measures of classical and multiple-site β are comparable, whereas null-model β may not be comparable among regions. However, in cases where γ is well known, multiple-site dissimilarity metrics offer several advantages, and should be strongly considered.},

We hypothesized that this gap can arise from ignoring spatial contexts (i.e. spatial scale and heterogeneity) that potentially mask an existing fitness-density relationship: a 'cryptic' Allee effect. To test this hypothesis, we analysed how spatial contexts interacted with conspecific density to influence the fertilization rate of the freshwater mussel Margaritifera laevis. This sessile organism has a simple fertilization process whereby females filter sperm from the water column; this system enabled us to readily assess the interaction between conspecific density and spatial heterogeneity (e.g. flow conditions) at multiple spatial levels. Our findings were twofold. First, positive density-dependence in fertilization was undetectable at a population scale (approx. less than 50.5 m(2)), probably reflecting the exponential decay of sperm density with distance from the sperm source. Second, the Allee effect was confirmed at a local level (0.25 m(2)), but only when certain flow conditions were met (slow current velocity and shallow water depth). These results suggest that spatial contexts can mask existing Allee effects.},

	abstract = {Wetlands are known to be effective sinks for nitrate. Wetland restoration and construction have gained traction as viable conservation measures to improve water quality in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. In addition to reducing nitrate in situ, wetlands may have impacts on water chemistry and temperature dynamics that extend beyond the confines of the wetlands themselves. Nonsaturating nitrate concentrations (NO3−), enhanced organic carbon effluxes, and altered temperature dynamics in streams downstream of wetlands could all affect denitrification rates within a stream network, potentially extending water quality benefits beyond wetland boundaries. We investigated the effect of wetlands on water chemistry, water temperature, and benthic denitrification rates in downstream agricultural ditches through a field measurement campaign over the open water season. We found that although ditches located downstream of wetlands had lower NO3− and higher DOC, ditch denitrification rate was not significantly altered by the presence of upstream wetlands. Rather, wetlands indirectly affected denitrification within ditches by strongly influencing the stoichiometry of the two limiting resources, NO3− and organic carbon. Peak denitrification rates in ditches were observed when DOC and NO3− supplies were approximately balanced, that is, at DOC: NO3− ratios that were near the microbial requirement for denitrification. NO3− limitation occurred primarily at sites with {\textgreater}3\% wetland cover, and in the fall season at all sites, and DOC limitation occurred primarily at sites with {\textless}1\% wetland cover. Temperature was found to be a secondary control that was important only when NO3− and DOC availabilities were balanced. Our results suggest that wetland restoration and construction targeting nitrate reduction within intensively agriculturally managed basins should be implemented in a way that promotes balanced resource availability throughout fluvial networks. Wetlands are an important regulator of resource availability and thus could be used to create conditions that maximize denitrification in NO3−-enriched watersheds.},

	abstract = {Aim The elucidation of patterns and drivers of community assembly remains a fundamental issue in ecology. Past studies have focused on a limited number of communities at local or regional scales, thus precluding a comprehensive examination of assembly rules. We addressed this challenge by examining stream fish community assembly within numerous independent watersheds spanning a broad environmental gradient. We aimed to answer the following questions: (1) are fish communities structured non-randomly, and (2) what is the relative importance of environmental filtering, predator–prey interactions and interspecific competition in driving species associations? Location The conterminous USA. Methods We used null models to analyse species associations in streams. Non-random communities were defined as those where the summed number of segregated and aggregated species pairs exceeded the number expected by chance. We used species traits to characterize species dissimilarity in environmental requirements (ENV), identify potential predator–prey interactions (PRED) and estimate likely degree of competition based on species similarity in body size, feeding strategies and phylogeny (COMP). To evaluate the effect of environmental filtering, predation and competition on species associations, we related ENV, PRED and COMP to the degree of species segregation. Results The majority (75–85\%) of watersheds had non-random fish communities. Species segregation increased with species dissimilarity in environmental requirements (ENV). An increase in competition strength (COMP) did not appear to increase segregation. Species pairs engaging in predator–prey interactions (PRED) were more segregated than non-predator–prey pairs. ENV was more predictive of the degree of species segregation than PRED. Main conclusions We provide compelling evidence for widespread non-random structure in US stream fish communities. Community assembly is governed largely by environmental filtering, followed by predator–prey interactions, whereas the influence of interspecific competition appears minimal. Applying a traits-based approach to continent-wide datasets provides a powerful approach for examining the existence of assembly rules in nature.},

Both carrying capacity and density dependence differed greatly among cells. Estimated carrying capacities ranged from 1.34 to 98.4 deer/km 2 . According to estimated population dynamics, grid cells with larger proportions of artificial grassland and deciduous forest were subject to lower density dependence and higher carrying capacity. We conclude that population dynamics of ungulates may vary spatially through spatial variation in carrying capacity and that the density level for controlling ungulate abundance should be based on the current density level relative to the carrying capacity for each area.},

One difficulty is that a single pairwise interaction can ripple through an ecological network and produce surprising indirect consequences. For example, the negative correlation between two competing species can be reversed in the presence of a third species that outcompetes both of them. Here, I apply models from statistical physics, called Markov networks or Markov random fields, that can predict the direct and indirect consequences of any possible species interaction matrix. Interactions in these models can be estimated from observed co-occurrence rates via maximum likelihood, controlling for indirect effects. Using simulated landscapes with known interactions, I evaluated Markov networks and six existing approaches. Markov networks consistently outperformed the other methods, correctly isolating direct interactions between species pairs even when indirect interactions or abiotic factors largely overpowered them. Two computationally efficient approximations, which controlled for indirect effects with partial correlations or generalized linear models, also performed well. Null models showed no evidence of being able to control for indirect effects, and reliably yielded incorrect inferences when such effects were present.},

Since 2007, however, CRP area has declined by over 25\% nationally with much of this land returning to agriculture. Despite this trend, it is unclear what types of CRP land are being converted, to what crops, and where. All of these specific factors greatly affect environmental impacts. To answer these questions, we quantified shifts in expiring CRP parcels to five major crop-types (corn, soy, winter and spring wheat, and sorghum) in a 12-state, Midwestern region of the United States using a US Department of Agriculture (USDA), field-level CRP database and USDA’s Cropland Data Layer. For the years 2010 through 2013, we estimate almost 30\%, or more than 530 000 ha, of expiring CRP land returned to the production of these five crops in our study area, with soy and corn accounting for the vast majority of these shifts. Grasslands were the largest type of CRP land converted (360 000 ha), followed by specifically designated wildlife habitat (76 000 ha), and wetland areas (53 000 ha). These wetland areas were not just wetlands themselves, but also a mix of land covers enhancing or protecting wetland ecosystem services (e.g., wetland buffers). Areas in the Dakotas, Nebraska, and southern Iowa were hotspots of change, with the highest areas of CRP land moving back to agriculture. By contrast, we estimate only a small amount (∼3\%) of the expiring land shifted into similar, non-CRP land-retirement or easement programs. Reconciling needs for food, feed, fuel, and healthy ecosystems is an immense challenge for farmers, conservationists, and state and federal agencies. Reduced enrollment and the turnover of CRP land from conservation to agriculture raises questions about sustaining ecosystem services in this region.},

However, the primary structure that has been studied in consumer-resource models has been hierarchical dispersal, where between-patch dispersal rates increase with trophic level. Here we use analytical, numerical, and simulation approaches on a two-patch, three-species metacommunity model to investigate the relationship between structure and community stability and resilience. We show that metacommunity stability is greater in systems with both weak and strong dispersal rates. Our system is stabilized by the formation of patterns when predators disperse frequently and herbivores disperse rarely, and via asynchrony when both predators and herbivores disperse infrequently.

Most research to date has focused on negative biotic interactions, but the importance of positive interactions such as mutualism and facilitation at large scales is less understood. We used a two-species occupancy modelling approach to decouple the relative effects of abiotic factors and biotic interactions between a habitat-modifying North American stream fish (Nocomis leptocephalus) and two of its nearly-obligate beneficiary species (Chrosomus oreas and Clinostomus funduloides). Location Sixty-one sites on tributaries to the New River basin in the Appalachian mountains of the eastern United States. Methods We sampled fishes using backpack electrofishing in the summers of 2012–2014. We gathered 10 habitat covariates from the National Hydrography Dataset and from instream measurements. We reduced dimensionality in habitat variables, corrected them for spatial autocorrelation and selected two eigenvectors as habitat covariates. We then used an information-theoretic approach to compare two-species occupancy models representing hypotheses specifying the importance of only habitat, only biotic interactions, or combinations of both. Results The best model for each species combination specified the importance of biotic interactions. For both associate species, probabilities that associates would occur in the absence of their host were considerably lower than probabilities of co-occurrence. Species interaction factors indicated positive patterns of co-occurrence between hosts and associates. Models suggested that habitat variables mediated host-associate interactions for C. oreas but not for C. funduloides. Main conclusions This study provides some of the first large-scale quantitative evidence of positive co-occurrence among vertebrates, and demonstrates the importance of abiotic context for mediating interspecific interactions. Two-species occupancy modelling may be superior to traditional co-occurrence analyses for parsing out the relative importance of biotic interactions and habitat variables for determining species distributions. However, experiments and small-scale behavioural observations will also be necessary to confirm mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Stable coexistence of ecologically identical species is not possible according to the established ecological theory. Many coexistence mechanisms have been proposed, but they all involve some form of ecological differentiation among the competing species. The aggregation model of coexistence would predict coexistence of identical species if there would be a mechanism that generates spatially aggregated distributions that are not completely correlated among the species. Our aim is to demonstrate that continued dispersal, triggered by reproductive interference between ecologically identical species, is such a mechanism. This study has been motivated by species using ephemeral patchy resources, such as decomposing fruits, fungal sporophores, carrion, and dung. We analyse an individual-based model with sexual reproduction, in which the progeny develops in ephemeral resource patches and the new generation disperses to a new set of patches. We assume spatially restricted dispersal, that patches differ in detectability, and that unmated females continue dispersal. In the model, reproductive interference (males spend some time searching for and/or attempting to mate with heterospecific females) reduces the mating rate of females, especially in the less common species, which leads to increased dispersal and reduces spatial correlation in species' distributions. For a wide range of parameter values, coexisting species show a systematic difference in their relative abundances due to two opposing forces: (1) uncommon species have reduced growth rate (Allee effect), which decreases abundance; (2) an abundance difference between the species reduces interspecific spatial correlation, which in turn reduces interspecific competition and allows the rarer species to persist at low density. Our results demonstrate a new mechanism for coexistence that is not based on ecological differentiation between species.},

Time-series data provide a window onto a system’s dynamics, and should furnish tests of the neutral hypothesis that are more powerful to detect deviations from neutrality and more informative about to the type of competitive asymmetry that drives the deviation. Here, we present a neutrality test for time-series data. We apply this test to several microbial time-series and financial time-series and find that most of these systems are not neutral. Our test isolates the covariance structure of neutral competition, thus facilitating further exploration of the nature of asymmetry in the covariance structure of competitive systems. Much like neutrality tests from population genetics that use relative abundance distributions have enabled researchers to scan entire genomes for genes under selection, we anticipate our time-series test will be useful for quick significance tests of neutrality across a range of ecological, economic, and sociological systems for which time-series data are available. Future work can use our test to categorize and compare the dynamic fingerprints of particular competitive asymmetries (frequency dependence, volatility smiles, etc) to improve forecasting and management of complex adaptive systems.},

	abstract = {The two most common approaches for analysing count data are to use a generalized linear model (GLM), or transform data, and use a linear model (LM). The latter has recently been advocated to more reliably maintain control of type I error rates in tests for no association, while seemingly losing little in power. We make three points on this issue. Point 1 – Choice of statistical model should primarily be made on the grounds of data properties. Choice of testing procedure should be considered and addressed as a separate issue, after model choice. If models with the appropriate data properties nonetheless have statistical problems such as type I error control (i.e. type I error rate greatly exceeds the intended significance level), the best solution is to keep the model but fix the problems. Point 2 – When a test has problems with type I error control, it can usually be corrected, but this may require departure from software default approaches. In particular, resampling is a good solution for small samples that can be easy to implement. Point 3 –Tests based on models that better fit the data (e.g. a negative binomial for overdispersed count data) tend to have better power properties and in some instances have considerably higher power. We illustrate these issues for a 2 × 2 experiment with a count response. This seemingly simple problem becomes hard when the experimental design is unbalanced, and software default procedures using LMs or GLMs can have difficulties, although in both cases the issues can be fixed. We conclude that, when GLMs are thought to fit count data well, and when any necessary steps are taken to correct type I error rates, they should be used rather than LMs. Nonetheless, standard LM tests are often robust and can have good type I error control, so there is an argument for their use for counts when diagnostics are difficult and statistical models are complex, although at some risk of loss of power and interpretability.},

	abstract = {The β-null deviation measure, developed as a null model for β-diversity, is increasingly used in empirical studies to detect the underlying structuring mechanisms in communities (e.g. niche versus neutral and stochastic versus deterministic). Despite growing use, the ecological interpretation of the presence/absence and abundance-based versions of the β-null diversity measure have not been tested against communities with known assembly mechanisms, and thus have not been validated as an appropriate tool for inferring assembly mechanisms. Using a mechanistic model with known assembly mechanisms, we simulated replicate metacommunities and examined β-null deviation values 1) across a gradient of niche (species-sorting) to neutrally structured metacommunities, 2) through time, and 3) we compared the effect of changes in assembly mechanism on the performance of the β-null deviation measures. The impact of stochasticity on assembly outcomes was also considered. β-null deviation measures proved to be interpretable as a measure of niche or neutral assembly. However, the presence/absence version of the β-null deviation measure could not differentiate between niche and neutral metacommunities if demographic stochasticity were present. The abundance-based β-null deviation measure was successful in distinguishing between niche and neutral metacommunities and was robust to the presence of stochasticity, changes through time, and changing assembly mechanisms. However, we suggest that it is not robust to changing abundance evenness distributions or sampling of communities, and so its interpretation still requires some care. We encourage the testing of the assumptions behind null models for ecology and care in their application.},

	abstract = {Each year, millions of hatchery-raised fish are stocked into streams and rivers worldwide, yet the effects of hatchery-raised fish on stream nutrient cycles have seldom been examined. We quantified the influence of supplemental nonnative fish stocking, a widespread recreational fishery management practice, on in-stream nutrient storage and cycling. We predicted that supplemental, hatchery-raised brown trout (Salmo trutta) stocking would result in increased N and P supply relative to in-stream biotic demand for those nutrients and that stocked fishes would remineralize and store a significantly greater amount of N and P than the native fish community, due to higher areal biomass. To test these predictions, we measured the biomass, nutrient (NH4+-N and soluble reactive phosphorus [SRP]) remineralization rates, and body carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content of the native fish community and trout stocked into four study streams. We then estimated fish growth rates to determine species-specific nutrient sequestration rates in body tissues for both stocked and native fish and measured ammonium and phosphorus uptake rates to determine the relative influence of net fish nutrient remineralization on stream nutrient cycles. When brown trout were stocked in these systems at density levels that were orders of magnitude higher than ambient native fish density, they provided a sizeable source of NH4+-N that could account for up to 85\% of demand for that nutrient. Stocked trout had minimal effects on in-stream SRP cycles even at high release densities, likely due to low per capita SRP excretion rates. A unique feature of our study was that we evaluated the temporal component of the stocked trout nutrient subsidy by estimating the number of fish removed from the system through natural mortality and angler harvest, which indicated that the stocked trout subsidy lasted approximately 6–8 weeks after stocking. By combining population models with areal nutrient excretion rates and estimates of biotic nutrient uptake, we showed that trout stocking provided a strong pulsed nutrient subsidy.},

This means that where local extinctions are more likely outside PAs, a positive feedback loop could render PAs largely ineffective in decelerating extinctions, even where PAs effectively abate threats. Here we empirically test the elements of this feedback loop using distribution data for 1,572 threatened plants in Japan. Narrowly distributed species were indeed less likely to overlap PAs than widespread species, and local extinction rates for unprotected populations over 15 years were 1.5 times higher than those inside PAs. A simulation model showed that new PAs will substantially reduce extinction risk for widespread species, but not for narrowly distributed species, unless they are placed very precisely in the landscape. Our results suggest that a representation-extinction feedback will limit the effectiveness of PAs in preventing extinctions unless PA placement is carefully targeted.},

	abstract = {Predators control prey populations and influence communities and the functioning of ecosystems through a combination of consumptive and nonconsumptive effects. These effects can be locally confined to one ecosystem but can also be extended to neighboring ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the nonconsumptive effects of terrestrial avian predators on the communities of aquatic invertebrates inhabiting bromeliads and on the functioning of these natural ecosystems. Bromeliads with stuffed birds placed nearby showed a decrease in aquatic damselfly larvae abundance and biomass, and we can infer that these changes were caused by antipredator responses. These larvae, which are top predators in bromeliad ecosystems, changed the composition of the entire aquatic invertebrate community. While total species richness, mesopredator richness, and shredder abundance increased in the presence of birds, scraper biomass decreased, possibly as a consequence of the increase in mesopredator richness. High scraper biomass in the absence of birds may have accelerated detrital decomposition, making more nutrients available for bromeliads, which grew more. These results show that nonconsumptive effects triggered by terrestrial predators can cascade down to lower trophic levels and dramatically affect the functioning of aquatic ecosystems, which can in turn alter nutrient provision to terrestrial ecosystems.},

GJAM applications illustrate flexibility to the range of species-abundance data. Applications to forest inventories demonstrate species relationships responding as a community to environmental variables. It shows that the environment can be inverse predicted from the joint distribution of species.

	abstract = {A central question at the interface of food-web and climate change research is how secondary production, or the formation of heterotroph biomass over time, will respond to rising temperatures. The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) hypothesizes the temperature-invariance of secondary production, driven by matched and opposed forces that reduce biomass of heterotrophs while increasing their biomass turnover rate (production : biomass, or P:B) with warming. To test this prediction at the whole community level, we used a geothermal heat exchanger to experimentally warm a stream in southwest Iceland by 3.8°C for two years. We quantified invertebrate community biomass, production, and P : B in the experimental stream and a reference stream for one year prior to warming and two years during warming. As predicted, warming had a neutral effect on community production, but this result was not driven by opposing effects on community biomass and P:B. Instead, warming had a positive effect on both the biomass and production of larger-bodied, slower-growing taxa (e.g., larval black flies, dipteran predators, snails) and a negative effect on small-bodied taxa with relatively high growth rates (e.g., ostracods, larval chironomids). We attribute these divergent responses to differences in thermal preference between small- vs. large-bodied taxa. Although metabolic demand vs. resource supply must ultimately constrain community production, our results highlight the potential for idiosyncratic community responses to warming, driven by variation in thermal preference and body size within regional species pools.},

In this study, we created communities of bacterivorous ciliated protists in laboratory microcosms and manipulated assembly history, disturbance frequency, and the presence of dispersal among local communities to investigate the mechanisms behind community divergence. Specifically, we sought to understand how the role of assembly history changed in response to disturbance, dispersal, and the combination of the two. Assembly history influenced the identity of the dominant species through priority effects, and dispersal and disturbance showed interactive effects on both alpha and beta diversity. Dispersal substantially increased alpha diversity, but only in the absence of disturbance, and it reduced beta diversity, but not in the presence of low or mixed disturbance. These results demonstrate that the role of assembly history and the strength of priority effects depend on community context, suggesting that understanding the interactions between various factors shaping community assembly is important for understanding how ecological communities are structured.},

The temperature algorithm is based on statistical downscaling of atmospheric temperatures. The precipitation algorithm incorporates orographic predictors including wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. The resulting data consist of a monthly temperature and precipitation climatology for the years 1979–2013. We compare the data derived from the CHELSA algorithm with other standard gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network. We compare the performance of the new climatologies in species distribution modelling and show that we can increase the accuracy of species range predictions.

Despite increasing prominence and shared goals, their compatibility and complementarity have received little attention. This paucity of overlap not only presents an obstacle to newcomers to the field, but it also precludes further conceptual advances at their interface. Here, we present a synthetic treatment of the two frameworks. We review their main concepts and explore their theoretical and empirical relationship, focusing on how the resource supply ratio, impact niche, and requirement niche of contemporary niche theory translate into the stabilizing and equalizing processes of modern coexistence theory. We show, for a general consumer–resource model, that varying resource supply ratios reflects an equalizing process; varying impact niche overlap reflects a stabilizing process; and varying requirement niche overlap may be both stabilizing and equalizing, but has no qualitative effect on coexistence. These generalizations provide mechanistic insight into modern coexistence theory, while also clarifying the role of contemporary niche theory's impacts and requirements in mediating coexistence. From an empirical perspective, we recommend a hierarchical approach, in which quantification of the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is used to guide more focused investigation into the underlying niche factors determining species coexistence. Future research that considers alternative assumptions, including different forms of species interaction, spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and priority effects, would facilitate a more complete synthesis of the two frameworks.},

	abstract = {Gut microbiomes play crucial roles in animal health, and shifts in the gut microbial community structure can have detrimental impacts on hosts. Studies with vertebrate models and human subjects suggest that antibiotic treatments greatly perturb the native gut community, thereby facilitating proliferation of pathogens. In fact, persistent infections following antibiotic treatment are a major medical issue. In apiculture, antibiotics are frequently used to prevent bacterial infections of larval bees, but the impact of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) on bee health and susceptibility to disease has not been fully elucidated. Here, we evaluated the effects of antibiotic exposure on the size and composition of honeybee gut communities. We monitored the survivorship of bees following antibiotic treatment in order to determine if dysbiosis of the gut microbiome impacts honeybee health, and we performed experiments to determine whether antibiotic exposure increases susceptibility to infection by opportunistic pathogens. Our results show that antibiotic treatment can have persistent effects on both the size and composition of the honeybee gut microbiome. Antibiotic exposure resulted in decreased survivorship, both in the hive and in laboratory experiments in which bees were exposed to opportunistic bacterial pathogens. Together, these results suggest that dysbiosis resulting from antibiotic exposure affects bee health, in part due to increased susceptibility to ubiquitous opportunistic pathogens. Not only do our results highlight the importance of the gut microbiome in honeybee health, but they also provide insights into how antibiotic treatment affects microbial communities and host health.},

This study assessed temporal and geographic trends for violations of the 10 mg nitrate-N L–1 MCL in the conterminous U.S. We found that the proportion of systems in violation for nitrate significantly increased from 0.28\% to 0.42\% of all systems between 1994 and 2009 and then decreased to 0.32\% by 2016. The number of people served by systems in violation decreased from 1.5 million in 1997 to 200 000 in 2014. Periodic spikes in people served were often driven by just one large system in violation. On average, Nebraska and Delaware had the greatest proportion of systems in violation (2.7\% and 2.4\%, respectively), while Ohio and California had the greatest average annual number of people served by systems in violation (278 374 and 139 149 people, respectively). Even though surface water systems that serve more people have been improving over time, groundwater systems in violation and average duration of violations are increasing, indicating persistent nitrate problems in drinking water.},

The community-level drivers are defined as linear combinations of species abundances, and they may thus represent e.g. the total abundance of all species or the relative proportions of different functional groups. We show with simulated and real data how our approach can be used to compare different hypotheses on community structure.

While non-manipulative data allow for only correlative and not causal inference, this framework facilitates the formulation of data-driven hypotheses regarding the processes that structure communities. We model environmental filtering by variation and covariation in the responses of individual species to the characteristics of their environment, with potential contingencies on species traits and phylogenetic relationships. We capture biotic assembly rules by species-to-species association matrices, which may be estimated at multiple spatial or temporal scales. We operationalise the HMSC framework as a hierarchical Bayesian joint species distribution model, and implement it as R- and Matlab-packages which enable computationally efficient analyses of large data sets. Armed with this tool, community ecologists can make sense of many types of data, including spatially explicit data and time-series data.

The magnitude of these aquatic subsidies is often smaller than terrestrial subsidies to aquatic ecosystems but higher in nutritional quality, energy density, and nutrient concentration. The lateral extent of biological aquatic subsidies is typically small, extending only a few meters into riparian habitat; however, terrestrial consumers often aggregate on shorelines to capitalize on these high-quality resources. Although the ecological effects of aquatic subsidies remain partially understood, it is clear that ongoing human modification to aquatic ecosystems, riparian habitats and river floodplains affect the magnitude, quality, and spatial and temporal patterning of aquatic subsidies in terrestrial landscapes. These changes will alter the character of aquatic–terrestrial coupling and have consequences for terrestrial organisms that rely on these high-quality and temporally dependable resource subsidies. Homogenization of landscapes and flow regimes, eutrophication, exotic species, and contaminants all represent threats to the vital flows of aquatic-derived resources into terrestrial ecosystems. Research emphasizing that landscapes are integrated terrestrial–aquatic systems, characterized by both biological and hydrological flows among habitats, is needed for understanding the consequences of aquatic subsidies and managing ecological risks of ongoing human development.},

We examined the mechanisms underlying changes in primary productivity following experimental species loss scenarios in Mongolian grassland. The range of species loss scenarios was based on natural patterns of species abundance that reflect the species’ contributions to ecosystem processes. We found a clear reduction in productivity due to species loss only when species were lost randomly. Grassland productivity was relatively robust following nonrandom species loss scenarios. Even in the context of density compensation, the decrease in dominant trait values for leaf height would explain the reduction in productivity with random species loss. In contrast, the maintenance of dominant trait values of key productivity traits such as leaf dry matter content and leaf height might contribute to the maintenance of productivity in response to nonrandom species loss. Our experiment demonstrated that the responses and mechanisms of primary productivity to species loss differ according to the scenarios of species loss in natural grassland communities. The effects of diversity on productivity might be weak in mature natural systems when species loss is nonrandom. Understanding the consequences of realistic species loss on ecosystem functioning based on field-based removal experiments will give insights into real conservation strategies in the face of global biodiversity change.},

However, most empirical studies have classified organisms rather broadly (e.g., by functional group or taxonomic family) and have dismissed species-level linkages at the interface of ecosystems. Here, we show how allochthonous resource use varies among taxonomically similar species of ground beetles (family Carabidae) across seasons (June–September). We investigated seasonal shifts in the distribution of five beetle species and their dietary responses to spatial subsidies (emerging aquatic insects) in a Japanese braided river. Despite their taxonomic closeness, the ground beetles showed species-specific responses to spatial subsidies, and beetle distribution patterns tended to coincide with their diets. Overall, 1–56\% of ground beetle diets were derived from aquatic prey. One genus (Bembidion spp.) mainly consumed aquatic prey, while three species fed primarily on terrestrial prey across all seasons. However, one species (Lithochlaenius noguchii) showed shifts in its diet from aquatic to terrestrial prey according to subsidy availability. The observed variation in allochthonous resource use was likely related to species-specific foraging modes, physiological tolerance to dry conditions, and interspecific competition. Our findings suggest that considering species-specific interactions is necessary to fully understand cross-system interactions and recipient food-web dynamics.},

Here we propose the invariability–area relationship (IAR) as a novel approach to investigate the spatial scaling of stability. The shape and slope of IAR are largely determined by patterns of spatial synchrony across scales. When synchrony decays exponentially with distance, IARs exhibit three phases, characterized by steeper increases in invariability at both small and large scales. Such triphasic IARs are observed for primary productivity from plot to continental scales. When synchrony decays as a power law with distance, IARs are quasilinear on a log–log scale. Such quasilinear IARs are observed for North American bird biomass at both species and community levels. The IAR provides a quantitative tool to predict the effects of habitat loss on population and ecosystem stability and to detect regime shifts in spatial ecological systems, which are goals of relevance to conservation and policy.},

Previous classifications of co-occurrence patterns as nested, segregated, or modular have led to contradictory results and conclusions. These analyses usually do not incorporate the functional traits of the species or the environmental characteristics of the sites, even though the outcomes of species interactions often depend on trait expression and site quality. Here we address this shortcoming by developing a method that incorporates realized functional and environmental niches, and relates them to species co-occurrence patterns. These niches are defined from n-dimensional ellipsoids, and calculated from the n eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the variance–covariance matrix of measured environmental or trait variables. Average niche overlap among species and the spatial distribution of niches define a triangle plot with vertices of species segregation (low niche overlap), nestedness (high niche overlap), and modular co-occurrence (clusters of overlapping niches). Applying this framework to temperate understorey plant communities in southwest Poland, we found a consistent modular structure of species occurrences, a pattern not detected by conventional presence–absence analysis. These results suggest that, in our case study, habitat filtering is the most important process structuring understorey plant communities. Furthermore, they demonstrate how incorporating trait and environmental data into co-occurrence analysis improves pattern detection and provides a stronger theoretical framework for understanding community structure.},

	abstract = {Understanding the structure of and spatial variability in the species composition of ecological communities is at the heart of biogeography. In particular, there has been recent controversy about possible latitudinal trends in compositional heterogeneity across localities (β-diversity). A gradient in the size of the regional species pool alone can be expected to impose a parallel gradient on β-diversity, but whether β-diversity also varies independently of the size of the species pool remains unclear. A recently suggested methodological approach to correct latitudinal β-diversity gradients for the species pool effect is based on randomization null models that remove the effects of gradients in α- and γ-diversity on β-diversity. However, the randomization process imposes constraints on the variability of α-diversity, which in turn force γ- and β-diversity to become interdependent, such that any change in one is mirrored in the other. We argue that simple null model approaches are inadequate to discern whether correlations between α-, β- and γ-diversity reflect processes of ecological interest or merely differences in the size of the species pool among localities. We demonstrate that this kind of Narcissus effect may also apply to other metrics of spatial or phylogenetic species distribution. We highlight that Narcissus effects may lead to artificially high rejection rates for the focal pattern (Type II errors) and caution that these errors have not received sufficient attention in the ecological literature.},

However, current theories treat post-infection dispersal propensities as a fixed trait, and the plastic nature of host's responses to parasite infection has long been underappreciated. Here, we present a mark–recapture experiment in a single host–parasite system (larval parasites of the freshwater mussel Margaritifera laevis and its salmonid fish host Oncorhynchus masou masou) and provide, to our knowledge, the first empirical evidence that parasite infection induces size-dependent host dispersal in the field. In response to parasite infection, large fish become more dispersive, whereas small fish tend to stay at the home patch. The observed plasticity in dispersal is interpretable from the viewpoint of host fitness: expected benefits (release from further infection) may exceed dispersal-associated costs for individuals with high dispersal ability (i.e. large fish) but are marginal for individuals with limited dispersal ability (i.e. small fish). Indeed, our growth analysis revealed that only small fish hosts incurred dispersal costs (reduced growth). Strikingly, our simulation study revealed that this plastic dispersal response of infected hosts substantially enhanced parasite persistence and occupancy in a spatially structured system. These results suggest that dispersal plasticity in host species is critical for understanding how parasites emerge, spatially spread, and persist in nature. Our findings provide a novel starting point for building a reliable, predictive model for parasite/disease management.\%U http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/284/1866/20171491.full.pdf},

Understanding the mechanisms controlling community diversity, functions, succession, and biogeography is a central, but poorly understood, topic in ecology, particularly in microbial ecology. Although stochastic processes are believed to play nonnegligible roles in shaping community structure, their importance relative to deterministic processes is hotly debated. The importance of ecological stochasticity in shaping microbial community structure is far less appreciated. Some of the main reasons for such heavy debates are the difficulty in defining stochasticity and the diverse methods used for delineating stochasticity. Here, we provide a critical review and synthesis of data from the most recent studies on stochastic community assembly in microbial ecology. We then describe both stochastic and deterministic components embedded in various ecological processes, including selection, dispersal, diversification, and drift. We also describe different approaches for inferring stochasticity from observational diversity patterns and highlight experimental approaches for delineating ecological stochasticity in microbial communities. In addition, we highlight research challenges, gaps, and future directions for microbial community assembly research.},

(2012, Ecology, 93, 456–461) proposed that strong negative frequency dependence causes species to be rare while simultaneously buffering them against extinction. This hypothesis predicts that, on average, rare species should experience stronger negative frequency dependence than common species. However, it is unknown if ecological communities generally show this theoretical pattern. We discuss the implications of this phenomenon for community dynamics, and develop a method to test for a non-random relationship between negative frequency dependence and relative abundance using species abundance data from 90 communities across a broad range of environments and taxonomic groups. To account for biases introduced by measurement error, we compared the observed correlation between species relative abundance and the strength of frequency dependence against expectations from a randomization procedure. In approximately half of the analysed communities, we found increasingly strong negative frequency dependence with decreasing relative abundance: rare species experienced stronger frequency dependence than common species. The randomization test never detected stronger negative frequency dependence in more common species. Our results suggest that strong negative frequency dependence is a signature of persistent, rare species in many communities.},

	abstract = {Omnivory, feeding at more than one trophic level, is a prevalent feature of freshwater ecosystems. Understanding where and when omnivory is important, its relevance for sustaining diversity, and the effect it may have on ecosystem responses to disturbances, are necessary for effective management of freshwater ecosystems. The many theoretical predictions of the effects of omnivory are often contradictory, and empirical studies aimed at understanding omnivory have been difficult and contingent on a number of factors. Here, I synthesise theoretical evidence to generate five predictions of where omnivory will be most important in freshwater ecosystems, how it is maintained and the effect it will have on communities. First, theory indicates that, while strong omnivorous interactions are destabilising, weak omnivorous interactions usually enhance stability. Therefore, mechanisms which decrease the strength of omnivorous interactions should favour their occurrence and increase stability of food webs. Secondly, omnivorous interactions which are theoretically unstable may be found in stable food webs due to stabilising features of the web as a whole. Thirdly, omnivory is likely to persist primarily at intermediate productivity levels and be more common in disturbed environments. Fourthly, omnivory is likely to decrease the strength of trophic cascades. Finally, omnivores should generally make more successful invaders. These predictions are important for effective freshwater management because actions which decrease the strength of omnivorous interactions, such as maintaining habitat refuges for consumers (e.g. woody debris and aquatic plants), may be essential for sustaining biodiversity. In addition, if omnivores make better invaders, effective invasion management may benefit from focussing resources on omnivorous invaders to limit their spread and impact. Overall, this synthesis of theoretical and empirical studies indicates that, while their predictions may be frequently at odds, with deeper investigation they are largely reconcilable and can be used to make practical suggestions for the careful management of omnivory in freshwater food webs.},

However, high hydrochemical variability in headwater streams, where most carbon and nutrients enter river networks, has hindered effective modelling and management. We developed an analytical framework informed by landscape ecology and catchment hydrology to quantify spatiotemporal variability across scales, which we tested in 56 headwater catchments, sampled periodically over 12 years in western France. Unexpectedly, temporal variability in dissolved carbon, nutrients and major ions was preserved moving downstream and spatial patterns of water chemistry were stable on annual to decadal timescales, partly because of synchronous variation in solute concentrations. These findings suggest that while concentration and flux cannot be extrapolated among subcatchments, periodic sampling of headwaters provides valuable information about solute sources and subcatchment resilience to disturbance.},

This debate is especially pertinent to microbial communities, which play crucial roles in areas such as health, disease, industry, and the environment. Here, we created a synthetic microbial community using heritable genetic barcodes and tracked community composition over repeated rounds of subculture with immigration. Consistent with theory, we find a transition exists between neutral and selective regimes, and the crossover point depends on the fraction of immigrants and the magnitude of fitness differences. Neutral models predict an increase in diversity with increased carrying capacity, while our selective model predicts a decrease in diversity. The community here lost diversity with an increase in carrying capacity, highlighting that using the correct model is essential for predicting community response to change. Together, these results emphasize the importance of including selection to obtain realistic models of even simple systems.},

	abstract = {Core Ideas Cover crops increase time to runoff start and reduce runoff sediment loss. Grass cover crops can be effective at reducing nutrient leaching. Cover crops may have limited effect on reducing losses of soluble nutrients. Use of cover crops may reduce the amount of herbicide used by suppressing weeds. Reducing runoff sediment and nutrient loss as well as nutrient leaching from croplands is a high priority to mitigate nonpoint-source pollution (NPSP) of water sources, maintain soil fertility, and improve overall soil and water quality. Adoption of cover crops (CCs) can be a reemerging strategy to address these concerns. This article reviews the state-of-knowledge of CC impacts on water quality parameters, discusses factors that affect CC impacts, and identifies research areas. The review indicates that CCs increase time to runoff start by 10 to 40 min, and reduce both runoff volume by 10 to 98\% and sediment loss by 22 to 100\%. The few studies indicate that CC effects on total and dissolved nutrients in runoff are not generally significant. Grass CCs such as rye (Secale cereale L.) can reduce nitrate leaching between 18 and 95\%. Cover crop effectiveness can be in this order: nitrate leaching ≥ sediment {\textgreater} runoff {\textgreater} dissolved nutrients in runoff, indicating that CCs are highly effective at reducing nutrient leaching but can have limited effects on reducing transport of dissolved nutrients. More measured and modeled data evaluating CC effects on water quality under different CC management factors including planting and termination dates, CC species, CC mixtures or single species, and tillage systems are needed. Additionally, specific data on CC belowground biomass and their relations with soil erodibility are scanty. In conclusion, CCs can reduce runoff, sediment loss, and nitrate leaching, but may have smaller effects on reducing dissolved nutrients in runoff.},

Incorporating interspecific interactions in predictive models is common in ecology, yet most methods do not adequately account for indirect interactions (where an interaction between two species is masked by their shared interactions with a third) and assume interactions do not vary along environmental gradients. Markov random fields (MRF) overcome these limitations by estimating interspecific interactions, while controlling for indirect interactions, from multispecies occurrence data. We illustrate the utility of MRFs for ecologists interested in interspecific interactions, and demonstrate how covariates can be included (a set of models known as Conditional Random Fields, CRF) to infer how interactions vary along environmental gradients. We apply CRFs to two data sets of presence–absence data. The first illustrates how blood parasite (Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, and nematode microfilaria spp.) co-infection probabilities covary with relative abundance of their avian hosts. The second shows that co-occurrences between mosquito larvae and predatory insects vary along water temperature gradients. Other applications are discussed, including the potential to identify replacement or shifting impacts of highly connected species along climate or land-use gradients. We provide tools for building CRFs and plotting/interpreting results as an R package.},

Previous work examining ecological dynamics in river networks has focused on within-trophic-level dynamics, with less emphasis on food-web interactions. Yet, trophic interactions in rivers are influenced by processes that may interact with network structure and position. Using a spatially explicit consumer–resource model, we explore how trophic dynamics are influenced by the branching nature of river networks. We focus on cases where the consumer–resource interaction is prone to temporal oscillations and periodic low population sizes. In these cases, we find that the influence of network structure and dispersal can reduce temporal variability and increase persistence of consumers and resources at the metacommunity scale. The effects of network structure and dispersal on our observed metacommunity dynamics result from asynchrony among dynamics of local communities: when asynchronous local fluctuations are averaged, consumer–resource dynamics become less variable and bounded higher above zero at regional spatial scales. Fluctuations synchronise across clusters of linked local communities. Communities that connect to only one other downstream community typically vary independently of other patches and show high variability, while communities that are linked to multiple upstream and downstream habitats show greater clustering and less variability. These patterns suggest that headwater versus mainstem locations in river networks may show different levels of population variability and thus differential responses to management and restoration efforts.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a foundational characteristic of ecological systems. Under global change, understanding temporal community heterogeneity is necessary for predicting the stability of ecosystem functions and services. Indeed, spatial heterogeneity is commonly used in alternative stable state theory as a predictor of temporal heterogeneity and therefore an early indicator of regime shifts. To evaluate whether spatial heterogeneity in species composition is predictive of temporal heterogeneity in ecological communities, we analyzed 68 community data sets spanning freshwater and terrestrial systems where measures of species abundance were replicated over space and time. Of the 68 data sets, 55 (81\%) had a weak to strongly positive relationship between spatial and temporal heterogeneity, while in the remaining communities the relationship was weak to strongly negative (19\%). Based on a mixed model analysis, we found a significant but weak overall positive relationship between spatial and temporal heterogeneity across all data sets combined, and within aquatic and terrestrial data sets separately. In addition, lifespan and successional stage were negatively and positively related to temporal heterogeneity, respectively. We conclude that spatial heterogeneity may be a predictor of temporal heterogeneity in ecological communities, and that this relationship may be a general property of many terrestrial and aquatic communities.},

Nevertheless, the limitation is not technical, and thus, we presumed that fragile production chains and economic feasibility might be the major issues. Therefore, we investigated the intensification as a way to improve the system's profitability and resilience. We have reported relevant costs and revenues of hypothetical hatcheries stocking 50, 100, and 140 larvae per L in clear water recirculating systems. A Monte Carlo simulation assessed the risks associated with development and management. Data showed that all hatcheries are profitable. Nevertheless, 100 and 140 larvae per L reached better economic results than 50 larvae per L. With less than 40\% of the selling price, high-density hatcheries covered their costs and became profitable. The Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that high-density hatcheries are more resilient to production and marketing oscillations. However, the use of 140 larvae per L requires greater investment and is more susceptible to production risks and instabilities. Therefore, 100 larvae per L is the most appropriate stocking density for M. rosenbergii hatchery in clear water recirculating systems. Additionally, the scaled production, the adoption of realistic selling price, diversification of products and markets may strengthen the production chain and hatcheries resilience.},

	abstract = {Aquatic nitrate removal depends on interactions throughout an interconnected network of lakes, wetlands, and river channels. Herein, we present a network-based model that quantifies nitrate-nitrogen and organic carbon concentrations through a wetland-river network and estimates nitrate export from the watershed. This model dynamically accounts for multiple competing limitations on nitrate removal, explicitly incorporates wetlands in the network, and captures hierarchical network effects and spatial interactions. We apply the model to the Le Sueur Basin, a data-rich 2,880 km2 agricultural landscape in southern Minnesota and validate the model using synoptic field measurements during June for years 2013–2015. Using the model, we show that the overall limits to nitrate removal rate via denitrification shift between nitrate concentration, organic carbon availability, and residence time depending on discharge, characteristics of the waterbody, and location in the network. Our model results show that the spatial context of wetland restorations is an important but often overlooked factor because nonlinearities in the system, e.g., deriving from switching of resource limitation on denitrification rate, can lead to unexpected changes in downstream biogeochemistry. Our results demonstrate that reduction of watershed-scale nitrate concentrations and downstream loads in the Le Sueur Basin can be most effectively achieved by increasing water residence time (by slowing the flow) rather than by increasing organic carbon concentrations (which may limit denitrification). This framework can be used toward assessing where and how to restore wetlands for reducing nitrate concentrations and loads from agricultural watersheds.},

We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding.

Previous work has shown that closed-form approximations of Bayes factors are relatively easy to obtain for between-groups methods, such as an analysis of variance or t-test. In this paper, I extend this approximation to develop a formula for the Bayes factor that directly uses information that is typically reported for ANOVAs (e.g., the F ratio and degrees of freedom).

Average TD and FD increased at all but the global scale. Change in TD exceeded change in FD toward large scales, signaling functional resilience.

We propose a framework for modeling the between- and within-individual components of the population niche as a set of variance-covariance matrices, which can be visualized with ellipses or ellipsoids. These niche components can be inferred using multiple response mixed models, and can incorporate diverse types of data, including diet composition, stable isotopes, spatial location, and other continuous measures of niche dimensions. We outline how considering both individual and population niches in multiple dimensions may enhance our understanding of key concepts in ecology and evolution. Considering multiple dimensions as well as the within-individual component of variation can lead to more meaningful measures of niche overlap between species. The impact of a population on its food web or ecosystem can depend on the degree of individual variation (via Jensen's inequality), and we suggest how the dimensionality of individual specialization could amplify this effect. Finally, we draw from concepts in quantitative genetics and the study of animal personalities to propose new hypotheses about the ecological and evolutionary basis of niche shifts in multiple dimensions. We illustrate key ideas using empirical data from sea otters, wetland frogs, and threespine stickleback, and discuss outstanding questions about the consequences of multidimensional niche variation. Setting variation among individuals in an explicitly multivariate framework has the potential to transform our understanding of a range of ecological and evolutionary processes.},

However, the connection between weak interactions, derived from the theory of modular food web components, and keystone species, derived from empirical results, is not yet well understood. Here, we develop numerical techniques to detect potential oscillators hidden in complex food webs, and show that, both in random and real food webs, keystone consumer–resource interactions often operate to stabilise them.

	abstract = {Aim Biodiversity loss is a key component of biodiversity change and can impact ecosystem services. However, estimation of the loss has focused mostly on per-species extinction rates measured over a limited number of spatial scales, with little theory linking small-scale extirpations to global extinctions. Here, we provide such a link by introducing the relationship between area and the number of extinctions (number of extinctions–area relationship; NxAR) and between area and the proportion of extinct species (proportion of extinctions–area relationship; PxAR). Unlike static patterns, such as the species–area relationship, NxAR and PxAR represent spatial scaling of a dynamic process. We show theoretical and empirical forms of these relationships and we discuss their role in perception and estimation of the current extinction crisis. Location U.S.A., Europe, Czech Republic and Barro Colorado Island (Panama). Time period 1500–2009. Major taxa studied Vascular plants, birds, butterflies and trees. Methods We derived the expected forms of NxAR and PxAR from several theoretical frameworks, including the theory of island biogeography, neutral models and species–area relationships. We constructed NxAR and PxAR from five empirical datasets collected over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Results Although increasing PxAR is theoretically possible, empirical data generally support a decreasing PxAR; the proportion of extinct species decreases with area. In contrast, both theory and data revealed complex relationships between numbers of extinctions and area (NxAR), including nonlinear, unimodal and U-shaped relationships, depending on region, taxon and temporal scale. Main conclusions The wealth of forms of NxAR and PxAR explains why biodiversity change appears scale dependent. Furthermore, the complex scale dependence of NxAR and PxAR means that global extinctions indicate little about local extirpations, and vice versa. Hence, effort should be made to understand and report extinction rates as a scale-dependent problem. In this effort, estimation of scaling relationships such as NxAR and PxAR should be central.},

	abstract = {The gut microbiome plays a key role in animal health, and perturbing it can have detrimental effects. One major source of perturbation to microbiomes, in humans and human-associated animals, is exposure to antibiotics. Most studies of how antibiotics affect the microbiome have used amplicon sequencing of highly conserved 16S rRNA sequences, as in a recent study showing that antibiotic treatment severely alters the species-level composition of the honeybee gut microbiome. But because the standard 16S rRNA-based methods cannot resolve closely related strains, strain-level changes could not be evaluated. To address this gap, we used amplicon sequencing of protein-coding genes to assess effects of antibiotics on fine-scale genetic diversity of the honeybee gut microbiota. We followed the population dynamics of alleles within two dominant core species of the bee gut community, Gilliamella apicola and Snodgrassella alvi, following antibiotic perturbation. Whereas we observed a large reduction in genetic diversity in G. apicola, S. alvi diversity was mostly unaffected. The reduction in G. apicola diversity accompanied an increase in the frequency of several alleles, suggesting resistance to antibiotic treatment. We find that antibiotic perturbation can cause major shifts in diversity and that the extent of these shifts can vary substantially across species. Thus, antibiotics impact not only species composition, but also allelic diversity within species, potentially affecting hosts if variants with particular functions are reduced or eliminated. Overall, we show that amplicon sequencing of protein-coding genes, without clustering into operational taxonomic units, provides an accurate picture of the fine-scale dynamics of microbial communities over time.},

	abstract = {Intraspecific population diversity (specifically, spatial asynchrony of population dynamics) is an essential component of metapopulation stability and persistence in nature. In 2D systems, theory predicts that metapopulation stability should increase with ecosystem size (or habitat network size): Larger ecosystems will harbor more diverse subpopulations with more stable aggregate dynamics. However, current theories developed in simplified landscapes may be inadequate to predict emergent properties of branching ecosystems, an overlooked but widespread habitat geometry. Here, we combine theory and analyses of a unique long-term dataset to show that a scale-invariant characteristic of fractal river networks, branching complexity (measured as branching probability), stabilizes watershed metapopulations. In riverine systems, each branch (i.e., tributary) exhibits distinctive ecological dynamics, and confluences serve as "merging" points of those branches. Hence, increased levels of branching complexity should confer a greater likelihood of integrating asynchronous dynamics over the landscape. We theoretically revealed that the stabilizing effect of branching complexity is a consequence of purely probabilistic processes in natural conditions, where within-branch synchrony exceeds among-branch synchrony. Contrary to current theories developed in 2D systems, metapopulation size (a variable closely related to ecosystem size) had vague effects on metapopulation stability. These theoretical predictions were supported by 18-y observations of fish populations across 31 watersheds: Our cross-watershed comparisons revealed consistent stabilizing effects of branching complexity on metapopulations of very different riverine fishes. A strong association between branching complexity and metapopulation stability is likely to be a pervasive feature of branching networks that strongly affects species persistence during rapid environmental changes.},

The regulatory limit for nitrate in public drinking water supplies was set to protect against infant methemoglobinemia, but other health effects were not considered. Risk of specific cancers and birth defects may be increased when nitrate is ingested under conditions that increase formation of N-nitroso compounds. We previously reviewed epidemiologic studies before 2005 of nitrate intake from drinking water and cancer, adverse reproductive outcomes and other health effects. Since that review, more than 30 epidemiologic studies have evaluated drinking water nitrate and these outcomes. The most common endpoints studied were colorectal cancer, bladder, and breast cancer (three studies each), and thyroid disease (four studies). Considering all studies, the strongest evidence for a relationship between drinking water nitrate ingestion and adverse health outcomes (besides methemoglobinemia) is for colorectal cancer, thyroid disease, and neural tube defects. Many studies observed increased risk with ingestion of water nitrate levels that were below regulatory limits. Future studies of these and other health outcomes should include improved exposure assessment and accurate characterization of individual factors that affect endogenous nitrosation.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1902484116},
	abstract = {Species' geographic range size is a fundamental aspect of understanding and predicting changes in biodiversity patterns. Investigating the global drivers of geographic range size variation in freshwater fishes, we found clear evidence that current and historical connectivity are, by far, the main determinants of range size. More specifically, we found that, everything else being equal, species displaying basal position in the drainage network (i.e., lowland areas) and found in drainage basins that have had connections during Quaternary low-sea-level periods have larger range sizes than their counterparts. Our findings suggest that connectivity is the key component of riverine fish geographic range sizes. This may have important implications for evaluating the vulnerability of freshwater species to river fragmentation.Identifying the drivers and processes that determine globally the geographic range size of species is crucial to understanding the geographic distribution of biodiversity and further predicting the response of species to current global changes. However, these drivers and processes are still poorly understood, and no ecological explanation has emerged yet as preponderant in explaining the extent of species' geographical range. Here, we identify the main drivers of the geographic range size variation in freshwater fishes at global and biogeographic scales and determine how these drivers affect range size both directly and indirectly. We tested the main hypotheses already proposed to explain range size variation, using geographic ranges of 8,147 strictly freshwater fish species (i.e., 63\% of all known species). We found that, contrary to terrestrial organisms, for which climate and topography seem preponderant in determining species' range size, the geographic range sizes of freshwater fishes are mostly explained by the species' position within the river network, and by the historical connection among river basins during Quaternary low-sea-level periods. Large-ranged fish species inhabit preferentially lowland areas of river basins, where hydrological connectivity is the highest, and also are found in river basins that were historically connected. The disproportionately high explanatory power of these two drivers suggests that connectivity is the key component of riverine fish geographic range sizes, independent of any other potential driver, and indicates that the accelerated rates in river fragmentation might strongly affect fish species distribution and freshwater biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Patterns of trait distribution among competing species can potentially reveal the processes that allow them to coexist. It has been recently proposed that competition may drive the spontaneous emergence of niches comprising clusters of similar species, in contrast with the dominant paradigm of greater-than-chance species differences. However, current clustering theory relies largely on heuristic rather than mechanistic models. Furthermore, studies of models incorporating demographic stochasticity and immigration, two key players in community assembly, did not observe clusters. Here we demonstrate clustering under partitioning of resources, partitioning of environmental gradients, and a competition-colonization tradeoff. We show that clusters are robust to demographic stochasticity, and can persist under immigration. While immigration may sustain clusters that are otherwise transient, too much dilutes the pattern. In order to detect and quantify clusters in nature, we introduce and validate metrics which have no free parameters nor require arbitrary trait binning, and weigh species by their abundances rather than relying on a presence-absence count. By generalizing beyond the circumstances where clusters have been observed, our study contributes to establishing them as an update to classical trait patterning theory.},

Our analyses demonstrate that factors mediating P concentration-discharge relationships varied greatly across watersheds and included near-channel sediment sources, lake and wetland interception, assimilation by algal P, and artificial land drainage. The majority of gaged sites exhibited mobilizing behavior for all forms of P at event (i.e., daily) timescales and chemostatic behavior at annual timescales. The large majority of watershed P export ({\textgreater}70\%, on average) occurred during high flow conditions, suggesting that more frequent large storm events arising from climate change will drive increased P losses from agricultural watersheds without substantial management changes. We found that P export could be dominated by dissolved P, particulate P, or an even mix of the two forms, depending on watershed attributes. Implementation of management practices to control P losses must be guided by understanding of how local landscapes interact with current and future climate conditions. Managing for both dissolved and particulate P is required to reduce overall P load in many agricultural watersheds.},

	abstract = {Based on the framework of attribute diversity (a generalization of Hill numbers of order q), we develop a class of functional diversity measures sensitive not only to species abundances but also to trait-based species-pairwise functional distances. The new method refines and improves on the conventional species-equivalent approach in three areas: (1) the conventional method often gives similar values (close to unity) to assemblages with contrasting levels of functional diversity; (2) when a distance metric is unbounded, the conventional functional diversity depends on the presence/absence of other assemblages in the study; (3) in partitioning functional gamma diversity into alpha and beta components, the conventional gamma is sometimes less than alpha. To resolve these issues, we add to the attribute-diversity framework a novel concept: τ, the threshold of functional distinctiveness between any two species; here, τ can be chosen to be any positive value. Any two species with functional distance ≥ τ are treated as functionally equally distinct. Our functional diversity quantifies the effective number of functionally equally distinct species (or “virtual functional groups”) with all pairwise distances at least τ for different species pairs. We advocate the use of two complementary diversity profiles (τ profile and q profile), which depict functional diversity with varying levels of τ and q, respectively. Both the conventional species-equivalent method (i.e., τ is the maximum of species-pairwise distances) and classic taxonomic diversity (i.e., τ is the minimum of non-zero species-pairwise distances) are incorporated into our proposed τ profile for an assemblage. For any type of species-pairwise distance matrices, our attribute-diversity approach allows proper diversity partitioning, with the desired property gamma ≥ alpha and thus avoids all the restrictions that apply to the conventional diversity decomposition. Our functional alpha and gamma are interpreted as the effective numbers of functionally equally distinct species, respectively, in an assemblage and in the pooled assemblage, while beta is the effective number of equally large assemblages with no shared species and all species in the assemblages being equally distinct. The resulting beta diversity can be transformed to obtain abundance-sensitive Sørensen- and Jaccard-type functional (dis)similarity profiles. Hypothetical and real examples are used to illustrate the framework. Online software and R codes are available to facilitate computations.},

Here, we explore whether spatial scale-dependent patterns of β-diversity vary between microbial functional groups and bacterial taxa (i.e., diazotrophic and bacterial communities) across local to regional scales (from metres to hundreds of kilometres). Location Eastern China. Time period October and November 2015. Major taxa studied Diazotrophic and bacterial communities. Methods We use two complementary statistical tools to unveil biotic mechanisms (i.e., species association) underlying variation in β-diversity of diazotrophic and bacterial communities. We examined distance–decay slopes of both communities at the local (1–113 m), meso- (3.4–39 km) and regional (103–668 km) scales. We used an environmentally constrained checkerboard score and topological features of association networks as indices of species association. We then calculated contributions of species association, abiotic factors and geographical distance to explain community β-diversity. The scale-dependent distance–decay relationships were also examined in ubiquitous (high occupancy across samples) and endemic communities of diazotrophs and bacteria. Results Diazotrophs displayed steeper distance–decay slopes than bacteria, suggesting that the β-diversity of diazotrophic communities was more variable. The distance–decay slopes were dependent on spatial scales in both communities, owing to different contributions of geographical distance, abiotic factors and species association at three spatial scales. Intriguingly, species association was greater and contributed more to community β-diversity than other forces at the local scale, implying that species association could greatly alter community structures. Main conclusions Drivers of diazotrophic and bacterial community β-diversity depended on spatial scales, resulting in different distance–decay patterns. Moreover, this was the first study to use two methods to demonstrate that species association played important, but as yet unrecognized, roles in driving spatial scale-dependent β-diversity.},

Few empirical studies on dispersal have considered the effects of density at the local and landscape scale simultaneously. To explore this, we analyze 5 years of individual-based data from an experimental introduction of wild guppies Poecilia reticulata. Natal dispersal showed a decrease in local density dependence as density at the landscape level increased. Landscape density did not affect dispersal among adults, but local density-dependent dispersal switched from negative (conspecific attraction) to positive (conspecific avoidance), as the colonisation progressed. This study demonstrates that densities at various scales interact to determine dispersal, and suggests that dispersal trade-offs differ across life stages.},

Here we argue that HOIs – defined as non-additive effects of density on per capita growth – are best interpreted as emergent properties of phenomenological models (e.g. Lotka–Volterra competition) rather than as distinct ‘ecological processes’ in their own right. Using simulations of consumer-resource models, we explore the mechanisms and system properties that give rise to HOIs in observational data. We demonstrate that HOIs emerge under all but the most restrictive of assumptions, and that incorporating non-additivity into phenomenological models improves the quantitative and qualitative accuracy of model predictions. Notably, we also observe that HOIs derive primarily from mechanisms and system properties that apply equally to single-species or pairwise systems as they do to more diverse communities. Consequently, there exists a strong mandate for further recognition of non-additive effects in both theoretical and empirical research.},

	abstract = {Dispersal can strongly influence ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Besides the direct contribution of dispersal to population dynamics, dispersers often differ in their phenotypic attributes from non-dispersers, which leads to dispersal syndromes. The consequences of such dispersal syndromes have been widely explored at the population and community level; however, to date, ecosystem-level effects remain unclear. Here, we examine whether dispersing and resident individuals of two different aquatic keystone invertebrate species have different contributions to detrital processing, a key function in freshwater ecosystems. Using experimental two-patch systems, we found no difference in leaf consumption rates with dispersal status of the common native species Gammarus fossarum. In Dikerogammarus villosus, however, a Ponto-Caspian species now expanding throughout Europe, dispersers consumed leaf litter at roughly three times the rate of non-dispersers. Furthermore, this put the contribution of dispersing D. villosus to leaf litter processing on par with native G. fossarum, after adjusting for differences in organismal size. Given that leaf litter decomposition is a key function in aquatic ecosystems, and the rapid species turnover in freshwater habitats with range expansions of non-native species, this finding suggests that dispersal syndromes may have important consequences for ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {Aim Understanding how ecosystem functioning and evolution shape taxonomic assemblages is a lively debate basically involving two major opposite views: the niche- and dispersal-assembly hypotheses. Here, we introduce a new method allowing for the identification of the first-order process of assembly underlying a set of taxonomic assemblages. Methods Building on Clarke’s SIMPER (for “similarity percentage”) analysis of a taxon/locality occurrence data set, we develop a permutation-based algorithm named PER-SIMPER, allowing for the identification of the first-order process—either niche- or dispersal-assembly—that drives species distribution within two or more groups of assemblages. We demonstrate the reliability and robustness of the method through cellular automaton-like simulations generating niche-assembled and/or dispersal-assembled species occurrence data sets. Sensitivity analysis further allows evaluation of its accuracy and robustness to sampling effort, including reduced numbers of sampled localities and/or species. Main conclusions Niche- and/or dispersal-assembled communities generate very different SIMPER profiles, which, in turn, allow for the accurate and consistent identification of the first-order process of assembly operating within two or more groups of species assemblages through a threefold randomization procedure named PER-SIMPER. The PER-SIMPER method appears robust to varying sampling efforts that may affect the number of sampled localities and/or species, especially when one of the two processes of assembly dominates the other. The PER-SIMPER analysis can be achieved on any empirical occurrence data set using a dedicated R function available as Supporting Information.},

	doi = {doi:10.1111/ecog.03908},
	abstract = {The hierarchical branching nature of river networks can have a strong influence on the assembly of freshwater communities. This unique structure has spurred the development of the network position hypothesis (NPH), which states that the strength of different assembly processes depends on the community position in the river network. Specifically, it predicts that (1) headwater communities should be exclusively controlled by the local environment given that they are more isolated and environmentally heterogeneous relative to downstream reaches. In contrast, (2) downstream communities should be regulated by both environmental and dispersal processes due to increased connectivity given their central position in the riverscape. Although intuitive, the NPH has only been evaluated on a few catchments and it is not yet clear whether its predictions are generalizable. To fill this gap, we tested the NPH on river dwelling fishes using an extensive dataset from 28 French catchments. Stream and climatic variables were assembled to characterize environmental conditions and graph theory was applied on river networks to create spatial variables. We tested both predictions using variation partitioning analyses separately for headwater and downstream sites in each catchment. Only 10 catchments supported both predictions, 11 failed to support at least one of them, while in 7 the NPH was partially supported given that spatial variables were also significant for headwater communities. We then assembled a dataset at the catchment scale (e.g. topography, environmental heterogeneity, network connectivity) and applied a classification tree analysis (CTA) to determine which regional property could explain these results. The CTA showed that the NPH was not supported in catchments with high heterogeneity in connectivity among sites. In more homogeneously connected catchments, the NPH was only supported when headwaters were more environmentally heterogeneous than downstream sites. We conclude that the NPH is context dependent even for taxa dispersing exclusively within streams. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Aim Why are so many species rare, yet persistent? Possibly, rare species experience strong negative frequency dependence (NFD, i.e. strong intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition), which both makes them rare and buffers them against extinction. A second, not mutually exclusive, possibility is that rare species that experience weak NFD go extinct quickly due to demographic and environmental stochasticity. Both possibilities predict that persistent rare species will experience stronger NFD than common ones. A previous study confirmed this prediction in a range of mostly terrestrial communities. Here, we test that prediction in lake zooplankton and explore its theoretical basis. Location Fifty-three temperate lakes. Time period 1970–2011. Major taxa studied Cladocerans, copepods. Methods We used long-term time series data to estimate the covariance between strength of NFD and mean frequency (relative abundance) for crustacean zooplankton. We used a randomization test to ask whether the covariance between NFD and mean frequency is stronger than expected, given sampling error. We also calculated the covariance between NFD and mean frequency in simulated communities from three different ecological models. Results Rare species experience significantly stronger NFD than common species in over half of the communities. The distribution of associations between NFD and rarity is skewed towards weak associations, which always occur in communities with high evenness. All three theoretical models reproduce these empirical results, even though they are based on different mechanisms (demographic or environmental stochasticity, and mathematical constraints on possible NFD–frequency relationships). Main conclusions Rare species typically experience stronger NFD than common ones because there are many different ecological scenarios in which they will do so, and only a few scenarios in which they won’t. Like several other macroecological patterns, the tendency for rare species to experience stronger NFD than common ones is a “statistical attractor” that is hard to avoid.},

	abstract = {For over a century, hatchery programs have been used to subsidize natural salmon populations in order to increase fisheries opportunities and, more recently, to conserve declining natural populations. While an extensive literature has described the impacts of large-scale hatchery operations on freshwater ecosystems, less attention has been given to ecosystem interactions within the marine environment. We analyzed records of hatchery-released Chinook salmon in the Salish Sea to assess temporal and spatial changes in hatchery practices since 1950, with the goal of identifying potential implications for ecosystem dynamics and conservation efforts in the region. Over the past 65 yr, we found significant changes in the size and time at which juvenile salmon are released, resulting in decreased diversity of these traits. Research suggests that predation on juvenile salmon by other fish, avian, and marine mammal species could be size-dependent, and our results indicate that current hatchery practices are releasing Chinook salmon in the size range preferred by these predators. With current marine survival rates at chronically low levels, and increasing demand for hatchery subsidies, it is important to consider how modifying existing hatchery programs intended to reduce homogenization may promote more natural marine food web dynamics, with potential benefits to both hatchery and natural Chinook populations.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of data in water resources has created new opportunities to accelerate knowledge discovery with the use of advanced deep learning tools. Hybrid models that integrate theory with state-of-the art empirical techniques have the potential to improve predictions while remaining true to physical laws. This paper evaluates the Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL) hybrid modeling framework with a use-case of predicting depth-specific lake water temperatures. The PGDL model has three primary components: a deep learning model with temporal awareness (long short-term memory recurrence), theory-based feedback (model penalties for violating conversation of energy), and model pretraining to initialize the network with synthetic data (water temperature predictions from a process-based model). In situ water temperatures were used to train the PGDL model, a deep learning (DL) model, and a process-based (PB) model. Model performance was evaluated in various conditions, including when training data were sparse and when predictions were made outside of the range in the training data set. The PGDL model performance (as measured by root-mean-square error (RMSE)) was superior to DL and PB for two detailed study lakes, but only when pretraining data included greater variability than the training period. The PGDL model also performed well when extended to 68 lakes, with a median RMSE of 1.65 °C during the test period (DL: 1.78 °C, PB: 2.03 °C; in a small number of lakes PB or DL models were more accurate). This case-study demonstrates that integrating scientific knowledge into deep learning tools shows promise for improving predictions of many important environmental variables.},

	abstract = {Diversification of fisheries and agroecosystems can increase and stabilize production and revenue, despite unpredictable changes in ecosystems and markets. Recent work suggests that diversification can provide multiple benefits simultaneously, but empirical evidence of relationships between catch or crop diversification and the provision of multiple benefits is scarce. The effect of diversification on multiple benefits may vary temporally and among systems. Using long-term (11–54 years) capture fishery statistics from five Japanese lakes, we examined whether catch diversity increased multiple benefits, including revenue, nitrogen and phosphorus removal, and seasonal commercial species diversity. We also assessed whether catch species diversity increased the stability of each benefit via a portfolio effect (PE). Our study revealed positive relationships between catch diversity and the bundle of benefits (the mean of all normalized benefits; i.e., the provisioning of multiple benefits) in all five lakes, even after controlling for the total catch. The effects of catch diversity on individual benefits were positive or insignificant and differed among the study lakes. These differences were likely caused by the range and variation of functional characteristics among catch species. The influence of the annual mean price on revenue suggested that market forces did have an effect. We also found that aggregated revenue as well as N and P removal were 1.6–2.1 times (four lakes), 1.5–2.2 times (four lakes), and 1.4–2.2 times (all five lakes) more stable, respectively, than would be expected if only a single species were harvested. This greater stability suggests that maintaining catch species diversity may increase the stability of multiple benefits through PEs. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis suggests that catch diversification has great potential to increase the magnitude and stability of multiple benefits. Although total catch alone was sufficient to provide multiple benefits, a goal of maximization with specialization may decrease stability and deplete resources. Under fluctuating environmental and economic conditions, diversification strategies promise to be a potential management option for achieving resilient and sustainable inland fisheries.},

Moving from vague, emotional reactions about mussel restoration to more rigorous discussions and analyses can help focus efforts to where they do the most good. We suggest that: (i) projects to restore mussels for conservation goals to sites where known environmental problems have been eliminated or mitigated have good prospects for success; (ii) projects to restore mussels for conservation goals to sites where known environmental problems have not been eliminated or mitigated have poor prospects for success; (iii) projects to restore mussels for conservation goals to sites in the common situation in which the status of environmental problems is unknown have unknown prospects for success, but may be valuable as scientific experiments, if project performance is monitored properly; (iv) the value of population augmentation as a conservation tool is uncertain, and needs better theoretical and empirical analysis; (v) assisted migration of mussels as a conservation tool is controversial, and should be discussed thoroughly before we reach crises in which it is rejected or carried out carelessly; (vi) projects to restore ecosystem services face more stringent criteria for success than conservation projects, and some such projects being discussed seem unlikely to succeed. Monitoring data on how restoration projects perform typically are inadequately collected, reported, disseminated, and used to improve practice. This could be improved by setting up a clearinghouse to collect, hold, and disseminate data; providing training to restorationists; and opening conversations between restorationists and data managers and statisticians.},

The model considers fluvial dynamics such as floodplain inundation and as well simulates seasonal freeze-thaw cycles for temperate and arctic rivers, and it was found that proposed physically based parameterizations appropriately reproduced in situ observed seasonal variations in 12 global rivers. Theoretically, floodplain inundation has two major effects on water temperature variability: (1) “broadening” of water surfaces, which increases heat exchange with the atmosphere and friction with river bed, and (2) “shallowing” mean water depth, which increases the absorption rate of shortwave radiation per unit volume. In contrast to the broadening which affects both warming and cooling processes, the shallowing causes warming only and has dominant impacts mainly during the ice melting season in Arctic regions and the rainy season in the tropics. Furthermore, it was revealed that lateral mixing between channel and floodplain has a significant impact on determination of river water temperature. Although water temperature plays an important role in water quality and riverine material circulation linking terrestrial and coastal environments, it has not been considered in most Earth system models. The improvements in global-scale river water temperature modeling demonstrated in this study will benefit for future Earth systems research.},

The positive association of FCL and ecosystem size has been consistently supported in natural systems. Recent studies, however, have begun to report no effects of ecosystem size on FCL. The emerging inconsistency among previous studies implies the existence of overlooked factors that can modulate the relationship between FCL and ecosystem size. Here, we developed a mathematical model describing metacommunity dynamics to show that large ecosystems do not necessarily support long food chains in the presence of spatially correlated disturbance. Our simple model predicted that the effect of ecosystem size was strongly dependent on the spatial extent of disturbance synchrony. When the spatial correlation of disturbance was weak, the positive association between FCL and ecosystem size appeared. However, the relationship of FCL and ecosystem size became more complex, including hump-shaped and multimodal forms, as the spatial extent of disturbance synchrony increases. This pattern emerged because larger ecosystems have wider aerial coverage, so more chances exist that an episodic disturbance hits some of the habitat patches and spreads across the landscape. Our finding highlights the important role of spatial disturbance synchrony in driving FCL, providing insights into why ecosystem size effects are variable across systems.},

Specifically, dispersal represents a mechanism to escape fitness costs resulting from changes in environmental conditions. Decades of empirical work suggest that individuals use local habitat cues to make movement decisions, but theory predicts that dispersal can also evolve as a fixed trait, independent of local conditions, in environments characterized by a history of stochastic spatiotemporal variation. Until now, however, both conditional and fixed models of dispersal evolution have primarily been evaluated using emigration data (stay vs. leave), and not dispersal distances: a more comprehensive measure of dispersal. Our goal was to test whether conditional or fixed models of dispersal evolution predict variation in dispersal distance in the stream salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus. We quantified variation in habitat conditions using measures of salamander performance from 4 yr of spatially explicit, capture–mark–recapture (CMR) data across three headwater streams in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in central New Hampshire, USA. We used body condition as an index of local habitat quality that individuals may use to make dispersal decisions, and survival probability estimated from multistate CMR models as an index of mortality risk resulting from the long-term history of environmental variation. We found that dispersal distances increased with declining survival probability, indicating that salamanders disperse further in risky environments. Dispersal distances were unrelated to spatial variation in body condition, suggesting that salamanders do not base dispersal distance decisions on local habitat quality. Our study provides the first empirical support for fixed models of dispersal evolution, which predict that dispersal evolves in response to a history of spatiotemporal environmental variation, rather than as a conditional response to current habitat conditions. More broadly, this study underscores the value of assessing alternative scales of environmental variation to gain a more complete and balanced understanding of dispersal evolution.},

However, not all types of regimes are going to change in the same way. Climate change impact assessments can therefore benefit from identifying classes of catchments with similar streamflow regimes. Traditional catchment classification approaches have focused on specific meteorological and/or streamflow indices, usually neglecting the temporal information stored in the data.

Our results show that these spatially contiguous classes are not only similar in terms of their regimes, but also their flood and drought behavior as well as their physiographical and meteorological characteristics. We therefore deem the functional regime classes valuable for a number of applications going beyond change assessments, including model validation studies or predictions of streamflow characteristics in ungauged basins.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}To assess future regime changes, we use simulated discharge time series obtained from the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrologic model driven with meteorological time series generated by five general circulation models.

Both theory and experimental evidence support the idea that ecological interactions may affect co-occurrence, but it remains unclear to what extent the signal of interaction can be captured in observational data. It is now time to step back from the statistical developments and critically assess whether co-occurrence data are really a proxy for ecological interactions. In this paper, we present a series of arguments based on probability, sampling, food web and coexistence theories supporting that significant spatial associations between species (or lack thereof) is a poor proxy for ecological interactions. We discuss appropriate interpretations of co-occurrence, along with potential avenues to extract as much information as possible from such data.},

Because domestication modifies individual traits and because subtle changes in intraspecific variability can impact ecological dynamics, we argue that these purposeful introductions of domesticated fish may impact the functioning of recipient ecosystems. We posit that purposely introduced domesticated fish could be considered as native invaders and be investigated and managed using frameworks developed for biological invasions. Studies identifying the relative importance of the different ecological mechanisms leading to these ecosystems impacts and quantifying how the intensity of introduction and the level of domestication modulate their ecosystem impacts are needed. This will lead to a better appreciation of how the benefits from releasing domesticated fish are offset by the ecological costs on freshwater ecosystem functioning caused by human-induced local modification of intraspecific diversity patterns.},

This controversial hypothesis has been tested across many taxonomic groups and environmental contexts, and successfully predicts species abundance distributions across multiple high-diversity communities. However, it has been critiqued for its failure to predict a broader range of community properties, particularly regarding community dynamics from generational to geological timescales. Moreover, it is unclear whether neutrality can ever be a true description of a community given the ubiquity of interspecific differences, which presumably lead to ecological inequivalences. Here we derive analytical predictions for when and why non-neutral communities of consumers and resources may present neutral-like outcomes, which we verify using numerical simulations. Our results, which span both static and dynamical community properties, demonstrate the limitations of summarizing distributions to detect non-neutrality, and provide a potential explanation for the successes of neutral theory as a description of macroecological pattern.},

Here, we show for the first time that trees in a tropical forest exhibit a clustering pattern. In a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island in Panama, species abundances exhibit clusters in two traits connected to light capture strategy, suggesting that competition for light structures community composition.

Previous reviews of empirical studies have found the opposite, SS {\textgreater} SL, creating the single large or several small (SLOSS) debate. Aims Review the empirical and theoretical SLOSS literature; identify potential mechanisms underlying the SS {\textgreater} SL pattern; evaluate these where possible. Location Global. Time period 1976–2018. Major taxa Plants, invertebrates, vertebrates. Methods Literature review. Results Like previous reviews, I found that SS {\textgreater} SL dominates empirical findings. This pattern remained, although it was somewhat weakened, in studies where sampling intensity was proportional to patch size. I found six classes of theory, and conducted five preliminary evaluations of theory. None of the predictions was supported. The SS {\textgreater} SL pattern held for specialist species groups, suggesting it does not result from incursion by generalists into small patches. I found no evidence for the prediction that the reverse pattern (SL {\textgreater} SS) becomes more common over time since patch creation, through gradual species losses from SS. I found no difference between results for natural and anthropogenic patches. There was also no evidence for predictions that SL {\textgreater} SS is more common when the matrix is more hostile, or for stable than ephemeral patches. Main conclusions Most empirical comparisons find SS {\textgreater} SL. While there are several potential causes, more empirical work is needed to identify those at play. Meanwhile, conservation practitioners should understand that there is no ecological evidence supporting a general principle to preserve large, contiguous habitat areas rather than multiple small areas of the same total size.},

	abstract = {Protecting riparian vegetation around streams is vital in reducing the detrimental effects of environmental change on freshwater ecosystems and in maintaining aquatic biodiversity. Thus, identifying ecological thresholds is useful for defining regulatory limits and for guiding the management of riparian zones towards the conservation of freshwater biota. Using nationwide data on fish and invertebrates occurring in small Brazilian streams, we estimated thresholds of native vegetation loss in which there are abrupt changes in the occurrence and abundance of freshwater bioindicators and tested whether there are congruent responses among different biomes, biological groups and riparian buffer sizes. Mean thresholds of native vegetation cover loss varied widely among biomes, buffer sizes and biological groups: ranging from 0.5\% to 77.4\% for fish, from 2.9\% to 37.0\% for aquatic invertebrates and from 3.8\% to 43.2\% for a subset of aquatic invertebrates. Confidence intervals for thresholds were wide, but the minimum values of these intervals were lower for the smaller riparian buffers (50 and 100 m) than larger ones (200 and 500 m), indicating that land use should be kept away from the streams. Also, thresholds occurred at a lower percentage of riparian vegetation loss in the smaller buffers, and were critically lower for invertebrates: reducing only 6.5\% of native vegetation cover within a 50-m riparian buffer is enough to cross thresholds for invertebrates. Synthesis and applications. The high variability in biodiversity responses to loss of native riparian vegetation suggests caution in the use of a single riparian width for conservation actions or policy definitions nationwide. The most sensitive bioindicators can be used as early warning signals of abrupt changes in freshwater biodiversity. In practice, maintaining at least 50-m wide riparian reserves on each side of streams would be more effective to protect freshwater biodiversity in Brazil. However, incentives and conservation strategies to protect even wider riparian reserves ( 100 m) and also taking into consideration the regional context will promote a greater benefit. This information should be used to set conservation goals and to create complementary mechanisms and policies to protect wider riparian reserves than those currently required by the federal law.},

Here we evaluate whether the geographical range boundaries of species coincide with ecophysiological limits to acquisition of aerobic energy4 for a global cross-section of the biodiversity of marine animals. We observe a tight correlation between the metabolic rate and the efficacy of oxygen supply, and between the temperature sensitivities of these traits, which suggests that marine animals are under strong selection for the tolerance of low O2 (hypoxia)5. The breadth of the resulting physiological tolerances of marine animals predicts a variety of geographical niches—from the tropics to high latitudes and from shallow to deep water—which better align with species distributions than do models based on either temperature or oxygen alone. For all studied species, thermal and hypoxic limits are substantially reduced by the energetic demands of ecological activity, a trait that varies similarly among marine and terrestrial taxa. Active temperature-dependent hypoxia thus links the biogeography of diverse marine species to fundamental energetic requirements that are shared across the animal kingdom.},

Most studies at the population level (e.g. changes in abundance or means of growth, mortality or fecundity) demonstrated density-dependence; however, these studies were not common, likely because they require long time series of data (at least 3–4 times mean generation time for the species). Our review indicated there was no evidence that the probability of finding density-dependent effects differed among the 21 species examined, but the number of studies per species varied substantially (5 [minimum for analysis] – 20+); hence, this finding should be viewed as tentative. Most salmonid species showed evidence of density-dependence in growth; however, few studies examined density-dependent effects on fecundity or recruitment, and further study is needed on these phenomena. There was no evidence that density-dependent effects were restricted to a particular habitat type or geographic region.},

Location Global. Time period 1966–2019. Major taxa studied Ecosystem-level measurements (all organism types). Methods We conducted a global quantitative synthesis of a wide range of ecosystem variables related to carbon stocks and fluxes. We gathered a total of 4,479 values from 1,223 individual sites (unique geographical coordinates) reported in the literature (604 studies), covering ecosystem variables including biomass and detritus stocks, gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, detritus decomposition and carbon uptake rates, across eight major aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem types and five broad climatic zones (arctic, boreal, temperate, arid and tropical). We analysed the relationships among variables emerging from the comparisons of stocks, fluxes and rates across ecosystem types and climates. Results Within our three-dimensional functioning space, average ecosystems align along a gradient from fast rates–low fluxes and stocks (freshwater and pelagic marine ecosystems) to low rates–high fluxes and stocks (forests), a gradient that we hypothesize results mainly from variation in primary producer characteristics. Moreover, fluxes and rates decrease from warm to colder climates, consistent with the metabolic theory of ecology. However, the strength of climatic effects differs among variables and ecosystem types, resulting, for instance, in opposing effects on net ecosystem production between terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems (positive versus negative effects). Main conclusions This large-scale synthesis provides a first quantified cross-ecosystem and cross-climate comparison of multivariate ecosystem functioning. This gives a basis for a mechanistic understanding of the interdependency of different aspects of ecosystem functioning and their sensitivity to global change. To anticipate responses to change at the ecosystem level, further work should investigate potential feedbacks between ecosystem variables at finer scales, which involves site-level quantifications of multivariate functioning and theoretical developments.},

Asynchronous species dynamics may buffer against such variability when a decrease in performance by some species is offset by an increase in performance of others. However, high climatic variability can eliminate species through stochastic extinctions or cause similar stress responses among species that reduce buffering. Local conditions, such as soil nutrients, can also alter production stability directly or by influencing asynchrony. We test these hypotheses using a globally distributed sampling experiment. Location Grasslands in North America, Europe and Australia. Time period Annual surveys over 5 year intervals occurring between 2007 and 2014. Major taxa studied Herbaceous plants. Methods We sampled annually the per species cover and aboveground community biomass [net primary productivity (NPP)], plus soil chemical properties, in 29 grasslands. We tested how soil conditions, combined with variability in precipitation and temperature, affect species richness, asynchrony and temporal stability of primary productivity. We used bivariate relationships and structural equation modelling to examine proximate and ultimate relationships. Results Climate variability strongly predicted asynchrony, whereas NPP stability was more related to soil conditions. Species richness was structured by both climate variability and soils and, in turn, increased asynchrony. Variability in temperature and precipitation caused a unimodal asynchrony response, with asynchrony being lowest at low and high climate variability. Climate impacted stability indirectly, through its effect on asynchrony, with stability increasing at higher asynchrony owing to lower inter-annual variability in NPP. Soil conditions had no detectable effect on asynchrony but increased stability by increasing the mean NPP, especially when soil organic matter was high. Main conclusions We found globally consistent evidence that climate modulates species asynchrony but that the direct effect on stability is low relative to local soil conditions. Nonetheless, our observed unimodal responses to variability in temperature and precipitation suggest asynchrony thresholds, beyond which there are detectable destabilizing impacts of climate on primary productivity.},

Field observations were conducted for 89 consecutive days in 2016 by recording the number of active nests and environmental variables. A total of 71 nests were located across study streams; bluhead chub and yellowfin shiner spawned between April and June. Spawning was observed periodically at intervals of 4–6 days within the same stream and across different streams, indicating broad-scale influences of the same environmental factors leading to synchrony. A generalized linear auto-regressive and moving average model showed that the periodic spawning pattern was likely caused by changes in water temperature, with effects of water level varying by stream. Specifically, spawning was triggered by a short-term (2-day) increase in water temperature and was observed under stable flow conditions (i.e. a lack of precipitation). This study showed that spawning periodicity of bluehead chub and yellowfin shiner tracked daily variation in in-stream conditions, indicating that their reproduction might be affected by anthropogenic disturbances that affect the rate of change in thermal and flow regimes at the fine temporal scale (e.g. hydroelectric dams and impervious cover).},

Here, I analyse the effects of stocking by Japanese marine and salmon stock enhancement programmes and evaluate their efficacy through a Bayesian meta-analysis of new and previously considered cases. The posterior mean recapture rate (±SD) was 8.3 ± 4.7\%. Without considering personnel costs and negative impacts on wild populations, the mean economic efficiency was 2.8 ± 6.1, with many cases having values of 1 to 2. On the macro-scale, the proportion of released seeds to total catch was 76 ± 20\% for Japanese scallop, 28 ± 10\% for abalone, 20 ± 5\% for swimming crab, 13 ± 5\% for kuruma prawn, 11 ± 4\% for Japanese flounder and 7 ± 2\% for red sea bream; according to these percentages, stocking effects were generally small, and population dynamics were unaffected by releases but dependent on the carrying capacity of the nursery habitat. All cases of Japanese releases, except for Japanese scallop, were probably economically unprofitable. Captive breeding reduces the fitness of hatchery fish in the wild. In addition, long-term releases replace wild genes and may cause fitness decline in the recipient population when the proportion of hatchery fish is very high. Short-term hatchery stocking can be useful, particularly for conservation purposes, but large-scale programmes may harm the sustainability of populations. Nursery habitat recovery and fishing pressure reduction often outperform hatcheries in the long run.},

Here we propose a novel analytical framework to assess metacommunity processes using path analyses of spatial and temporal diversity turnovers. We detail the principles and practical aspects of this framework and apply it to simulated datasets to illustrate its ability to decipher the respective contributions of entangled drivers of metacommunity dynamics. We then apply it to four empirical datasets. Empirical results support the view that metacommunity dynamics may be generally shaped by multiple ecological processes acting in concert, with environmental filtering being variable across both space and time. These results reinforce our call to go beyond static analyses of metacommunities that are blind to the temporal part of environmental variability.},

One model for how hybrid zones form and stabilize is the tension zone model, a version of which predicts that hybrid zone widths are determined by a balance between random dispersal into hybrid zones and selection against hybrids. Here, we examine whether random dispersal and proxies for selection against hybrids (genetic distances between hybridizing pairs) can explain variation in hybrid zone widths across 131 hybridizing pairs of animals. We show that these factors alone can explain ∼40\% of the variation in zone width among animal hybrid zones, with dispersal explaining far more of the variation than genetic distances. Patterns within clades were idiosyncratic. Genetic distances predicted hybrid zone widths particularly well for reptiles, while this relationship was opposite tension zone predictions in birds. Last, the data suggest that dispersal and molecular divergence set lower bounds on hybrid zone widths in animals, indicating that there are geographic restrictions on hybrid zone formation. Overall, our analyses reinforce the fundamental importance of dispersal in hybrid zone formation and more generally in the ecology of range boundaries.},

Topological structure and the distribution and magnitude of interaction strengths in food webs have been shown to confer important stabilizing properties. However, our understanding of how variable species interactions affect food-web structure and stability is still in its infancy. Anthropogenic stress, such as acid mine drainage, is likely to place severe limitations on the food-web structures availabe, due to changes in community composition and body mass distributions. Here, we used mechanistic models to infer food-web structure and quantify stability in streams across a gradient of acid mine drainage. Multiple food webs were iterated for each community based on species pairwise interaction probabilities, in order to incorporate the variability of realistic food-web structure. We found that food-web structure was altered systematically with a 32-fold decrease in the number of links and a twofold increase in connectance across the gradient. Stability generally increased sixfold with increasing acid mine drainage stress, regardless of how interaction strengths were estimated. However, the distribution of the stability measure, s, for some impacted communities separated into clusters of higher and lower magnitude depending on how interaction strengths were estimated. Management and restoration of impacted sites needs to consider their increased stability, as this may have important implications for the recolonization of desirable species. Furthermore, active species introductions may be required to overcome the internal ecological inertia of affected communities.},

Yet landscapes are rarely managed to suppress pests, in part because researchers seldom measure key variables related to pest outbreaks and insecticides that drive management decisions. We used a 13-year government database to analyse landscape effects on European grapevine moth (Lobesia botrana) outbreaks and insecticides across c. 400 Spanish vineyards. At harvest, we found pest outbreaks increased four-fold in simpliﬁed, vineyard-dominated landscapes compared to complex landscapes in which vineyards are surrounded by semi-natural habitats. Similarly, insecticide applications doubled in vineyard-dominated landscapes but declined in vineyards surrounded by shrubland. Importantly, pest population stochasticity would have masked these large effects if numbers of study sites and years were reduced to typical levels in landscape pest-control studies. Our results suggest increasing landscape complexity may mitigate pest populations and insecticide applications. Habitat conservation represents an economically and environmentally sound approach for achieving sustainable grape production.},

Therefore, interindividual differences in behaviour should contribute to individual niche specialization. Comparable with variation in morphological traits, behavioural differentiation between individuals should limit similarity among competitors and thus act as a mechanism maintaining within-species variation in ecological niches and facilitating species coexistence. Here, we aimed to test whether interindividual differences in boldness covary with spatial interactions within and between two ecologically similar, co-occurring rodent species (Myodes glareolus, Apodemus agrarius). In five subpopulations in northeast Germany, we quantified individual differences in boldness via repeated standardized tests and spatial interaction patterns via capture–mark–recapture (n = 126) and automated VHF telemetry (n = 36). We found that boldness varied with space use in both species. Individuals of the same population occupied different spatial niches, which resulted in non-random patterns of within- and between-species spatial interactions. Behavioural types mainly differed in the relative importance of intra- versus interspecific competition. Within-species variation along this competition gradient could contribute to maintaining individual niche specialization. Moreover, behavioural differentiation between individuals limits similarity among competitors, which might facilitate the coexistence of functionally equivalent species and, thus, affect community dynamics and local biodiversity.},

However, obtaining unbiased estimates of dispersal parameters from capture–recapture data is challenging because it is impossible to survey all possible range of dispersal in the field. There are several approaches to address this critical issue of capture–recapture methods. Still, a lack of formal comparisons among these modeling approaches has confused about which is the best practice given the available dataset. Here, I compared the performance of three dispersal models using test datasets simulated under various sampling designs. In the first approach, a probability distribution (a dispersal kernel) was simply fitted to the capture–recapture data (the “simple dispersal model”). In the second approach, a truncated probability distribution was used to account for the finite range of observations (the “truncated dispersal model”). Finally, the dispersal and observation processes were coupled to consider the spatial organization of sampling designs (the “dispersal–observation model”). The simulation study provided three important insights. First, the dispersal–observation model provided reliable estimates of dispersal parameters, even under sampling designs with a few recaptures. Second, the truncated dispersal model was also effective, but only when the number of recaptures was large. Finally, the use of the simple dispersal model caused a substantial underestimation of dispersal parameters regardless of sampling designs; this modeling approach should be avoided where possible. The results of this simulation study should help choose a suitable modeling approach.},

Despite growing knowledge of physiological and behavioural responses to these stimuli from single-species and local-scale studies, whether these pollutants affect fitness is less clear, as is how and why species vary in their sensitivity to these anthropic stressors. Here we leverage a large citizen science dataset paired with high-resolution noise and light data from across the contiguous United States to assess how these stimuli affect reproductive success in 142 bird species. We find responses to both sensory pollutants linked to the functional traits and habitat affiliations of species. For example, overall nest success was negatively correlated with noise among birds in closed environments. Species-specific changes in reproductive timing and hatching success in response to noise exposure were explained by vocalization frequency, nesting location and diet. Additionally, increased light-gathering ability of species’ eyes was associated with stronger advancements in reproductive timing in response to light exposure, potentially creating phenological mismatches7. Unexpectedly, better light-gathering ability was linked to reduced clutch failure and increased overall nest success in response to light exposure, raising important questions about how responses to sensory pollutants counteract or exacerbate responses to other aspects of global change, such as climate warming. These findings demonstrate that anthropogenic noise and light can substantially affect breeding bird phenology and fitness, and underscore the need to consider sensory pollutants alongside traditional dimensions of the environment that typically inform biodiversity conservation.},

	abstract = {Understanding how to scale up effects of biological diversity on ecosystem functioning and services remains challenging. There is a general consensus that biodiversity loss alters ecosystem processes underpinning the goods and services upon which humanity depends. Yet most of that consensus stems from experiments performed at small spatial scales for short time frames, which limits transferability of conclusions to longer-term, landscape-scale conservation policies and management. Here we develop quantitative scaling relationships linking 374 experiments that tested plant diversity effects on biomass production across a range of scales. We show that biodiversity effects increase by factors of 1.68 and 1.10 for each 10-fold increase in experiment temporal and spatial scales, respectively. Contrary to prior studies, our analyses suggest that the time scale of experiments, rather than their spatial scale, is the primary source of variation in biodiversity effects. But consistent with earlier research, our analyses reveal that complementarity effects, rather than selection effects, drive the positive space–time interactions for plant diversity effects. Importantly, we also demonstrate complex space–time interactions and nonlinear responses that emphasize how simple extrapolations from small-scale experiments are likely to underestimate biodiversity effects in real-world ecosystems. Quantitative scaling relationships from this research are a crucial step towards bridging controlled experiments that identify biological mechanisms across a range of scales. Predictions from scaling relationships like these could then be compared with observations for fine-tuning the relationships and ultimately improving their capacities to predict consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning and services over longer time frames across real-world landscapes.},

	abstract = {In species with obligate sexual reproduction, scarcity of males can occasionally limit female reproductive success. It is unclear, however, whether this impacts population-level persistence. Sexually deceptive orchids attract mate-searching male insects who lose time, mating opportunities and may even become sperm depleted by mating with flowers. These insects are almost exclusively haplodiploid, and able to reproduce regardless of sperm availability – which might mitigate costs of deception. We model the population dynamics of deceived diploid or haplodiploid pollinators. The model reveals that haplodiploidy can enhance prospects for coexistence. If ‘sperm theft' by orchids is severe enough to generate unmated females in the local pollinator pool, this enhances the production of sons, which are subsequently available to act as pollinators. The mechanism relies on female haplodiploids being able to reproduce with or without sperm; this is absent in many diploid insects – where unmated females do not reproduce. We show that this gives haplodiploids an ability to maintain higher population densities, and to persist up to higher orchid densities, than diploids. Our model identifies the enhanced resilience of haplodiploid pollinators against deceptive exploitation as a possible reason why these systems have persisted.},

	abstract = {Hawaiian stilts (Himantopus mexicanus knudseni) are an endangered subspecies of the Black-necked stilt endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. Despite long-term study, the main drivers of Hawaiian stilt population dynamics are poorly understood. We tested for density dependence using two sources of evidence: a 30-year time series of annual estimated range-wide abundance, and two 15+ year time series of reproductive success. Using separate methods with independent data, sources allowed us to make up for the potentially positive bias of one approach with the more conservative nature of the second. We compared nonlinear density-dependent and density-independent population model fits to our time-series data, using both frequentist and Bayesian state-space approaches. Across both approaches, density-dependent models best fit observed population dynamics, with lower AICc and cross-validation statistics compared to density-independent models. Among density-dependent models, a conditional model in which density-independent dynamics occur below a population size threshold ( 850–1,000 birds), and then density-dependent dynamics occur above that threshold, performed best across Bayesian and frequentist model comparisons, with the Ricker model ranked next or equivalently. Our analysis of reproduction data revealed a strong negative effect of local adult density on nest success (proportion of nests hatching at least one chick) at Kealia National Wildlife Refuge on Maui, where few alternative breeding habitats are available, but no such effect at another site where many nearby alternative wetlands are available. These congruent results across independent datasets and analytical approaches support the hypothesis that Hawaiian stilts exhibit density dependence across their range.},

Methods We analysed the relationship between biodiversity (species richness and functional diversity) and fish community biomass at 1,357 stream sites distributed throughout France. We used piecewise path analysis to quantify effects of abiotic and biodiversity variables on biomass and assess relative contributions of native and non-native species on the diversity–biomass relationship. Results Biodiversity showed a direct positive relationship with biomass after controlling for sampling effort, and direct effects of biodiversity variables on community biomass exceeded those of climate and physical habitat variables. Our analysis indicates that positive effects of species richness on biomass exceeded those of functional diversity. Indirect effects of abiotic variables mediated by biodiversity metrics indicated that biomass increased in warmer, lowland habitats. Human impact had no effect on native biodiversity but had a positive effect on non-native biodiversity. Main conclusions We provide evidence that direct effects of biodiversity on community biomass outweigh those of abiotic variables in riverine fish communities, but resource partitioning alone is unlikely to drive the effects of biodiversity on biomass in this system.

For 45 individual white storks (Ciconia ciconia; 116 individual-year combinations), we uncover high variability in individual environmental associations, consistency of individual niches over time, and moderate to strong niche specialization. Within populations, environmental niches follow a nested pattern, with individuals arranged along a specialist-to-generalist gradient. These results reject common assumptions of individual niche equivalency among conspecifics, as well as the separation of individual niches into disparate parts of environmental space.

	abstract = {Ecological stability refers to a family of concepts used to describe how systems of interacting species vary through time and respond to disturbances. Because observed ecological stability depends on sampling scales and environmental context, it is notoriously difficult to compare measurements across sites and systems. Here, we apply stochastic dynamical systems theory to derive general statistical scaling relationships across time, space, and ecological level of organisation for three fundamental stability aspects: resilience, resistance, and invariance. These relationships can be calibrated using random or representative samples measured at individual scales, and projected to predict average stability at other scales across a wide range of contexts. Moreover deviations between observed vs. extrapolated scaling relationships can reveal information about unobserved heterogeneity across time, space, or species. We anticipate that these methods will be useful for cross-study synthesis of stability data, extrapolating measurements to unobserved scales, and identifying underlying causes and consequences of heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Motivation We compiled a global database of long-term riverine fish surveys from 46 regional and national monitoring programmes and from individual academic research efforts, with which numerous basic and applied questions in ecology and global change research can be explored. Such spatially and temporally extensive datasets have been lacking for freshwater systems in comparison to terrestrial ones. Main types of variables contained The database includes 11,386 time-series of riverine fish community catch data, including 646,270 species-specific abundance records, together with metadata related to the geographical location and sampling methodology of each time-series. Spatial location and grain The database contains 11,072 unique sampling locations (stream reach), spanning 19 countries, five biogeographical realms and 402 hydrographical basins world-wide. Time period and grain The database encompasses the period 1951–2019. Each time-series is composed of a minimum of two yearly surveys (mean = 8 years) and represents a minimum time span of 10 years (mean = 19 years). Major taxa and level of measurement The database includes 944 species of ray-finned fishes (Class Actinopterygii). Software format csv. Main conclusion Our collective effort provides the most comprehensive long-term community database of riverine fishes to date. This unique database should interest ecologists who seek to understand the impacts of human activities on riverine fish biodiversity and to model and predict how fish communities will respond to future environmental change. Together, we hope it will promote advances in macroecological research in the freshwater realm.},

	abstract = {The species–area relationship (SAR) is one of the most well-established scaling patterns in ecology. Its implications for understanding how communities change across spatial gradients are numerous, including the effects of habitat loss on biodiversity. However, ecological communities are not mere collections of species. They are the result of interactions between these species forming complex networks that tie them together. Should we aim to grasp the spatial scaling of biodiversity as a whole, it is fundamental to understand the changes in the structure of interaction networks with area. In spite of a few empirical and theoretical studies that address this challenge, we still do not know much about how network structure changes with area, or what are the main environmental drivers of these changes. Here, using the meta-network of potential interactions between all terrestrial vertebrates in Europe (1140 species and 67 201 feeding interactions), we analysed network–area relationships (NARs) that summarize how network properties scale with area. We do this across ten biogeographical regions, which differ in environmental characteristics. We found that the spatial scaling of network complexity strongly varied across biogeographical regions. However, once the variation in SARs was accounted for, differences in the shape of NARs vanished. On the other hand, the proportion of species across trophic levels remained remarkably constant across biogeographical regions and spatial scales, despite the great variation in species richness. Spatial variation in mean annual temperature and habitat clustering were the main environmental determinants of the shape of both SARs and NARs across Europe. Our results suggest new avenues in the exploration of the effects of environmental factors on the spatial scaling of biodiversity. We argue that NARs can provide new insights to analyse and understand ecological communities.},

	abstract = {Aquatic habitats are closely linked to surrounding terrestrial systems via reciprocal subsidies. Much of the research on aquatic–terrestrial subsidies has focused on streams and lakes, while subsidies across aquatic–terrestrial boundaries of other systems, like temporary ponds, have received less attention. To address the lack of information regarding cross-habitat subsidies of temporary ponds, we quantified leaf litter inputs, amphibian egg inputs, terrestrial insect inputs, and amphibian metamorph and aquatic insect emergence for eight temporary ponds. We compared the relative magnitude of cross-habitat biotic subsidies of temporary ponds to identify potentially important yet overlooked subsidies. Terrestrial insect inputs to ponds were the second largest subsidy (mean 15.3 g m−2 yr−1), exceeding combined emergence of amphibians and aquatic insects (mean 4.0 g m−2 yr−1), yet these high-quality subsidies are generally unaccounted for in similar studies. Across the wetland complex, total amphibian emergence (8929.3 g yr−1) was nearly four times higher than total aquatic insect emergence (2491.9 g yr−1). Aquatic insect emergence was similar to that of lakes and streams while amphibian emergence was generally higher. Although larger ponds produced greater total fluxes to terrestrial habitats, smaller ponds were often more productive per unit area. Therefore, a mosaic of small ponds may produce greater or equivalent subsidies to terrestrial food webs than a single large pond. Given continued threats to temporary ponds and their connections to surrounding forests, management and restoration of these systems, as well as future studies, should take holistic approaches that account for the many aquatic–terrestrial linkages, and factors that influence them.},

	abstract = {Interspecific spatial associations (ISA), which include co-occurrences, segregations, or attractions among two or more species, can provide important insights into the spatial structuring of communities. However, ISA has primarily been examined in the context of understanding interspecific interactions, while other aspects of ISA, including its relations to other biodiversity facets and how it changes in the face of anthropogenic pressures, have been largely neglected. This is likely because it is unclear what makes ISA useful in a biodiversity context, little is known about the theoretical connections between ISA and other biodiversity facets, and there is a confusing variety of approaches to measuring ISA. Here, we first review the metrics of ISA. These include spatially implicit and explicit indices of association for binary, abundance, and point pattern data. We test and compare these approaches on empirical and simulated data, and we provide recommendations for how to use and interpret them in biodiversity science. We argue that measurements of ISA are more informative when they are spatially explicit (i.e., distance dependent). We then review links of ISA to other classical biodiversity facets, such as alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, and show that they mostly fail to reflect changes/variation in ISA, with the exception of average pairwise beta diversity. This underscores the need for a specific focus on ISA in large-scale biodiversity assessments. Finally, we argue that there are important, and underappreciated, reasons to study ISA that are unrelated to its link to biotic interactions. Specifically, ISA can provide strong tests of biodiversity theories that require multiple patterns to benchmark against, and it can be explored for potentially predictive macroecological patterns.},

In this study, we fit size spectra to field data from 45 rocky and coral reef sites along a 28° latitudinal gradient, comprising individuals from 0.125 mm to 2 m in body size. We found that 96\% of the variation in abundance along this ‘extended’ size gradient was described by a single linear function across all sites. However, consistent ‘wobbles’ were also observed, with subtle peaks and troughs in abundance along the spectrum, which varied with sea temperature, as predicted by theory relating to trophic cascades.},

We use high-resolution satellite and census data from India, the world’s largest consumer of groundwater, to quantify the impacts of groundwater depletion on cropping intensity, a crucial driver of agricultural production. Our results suggest that, given current depletion trends, cropping intensity may decrease by 20\% nationwide and by 68\% in groundwater-depleted regions. Even if surface irrigation delivery is increased as a supply-side adaptation strategy, which is being widely promoted by the Indian government, cropping intensity will decrease, become more vulnerable to interannual rainfall variability, and become more spatially uneven. We find that groundwater and canal irrigation are not substitutable and that additional adaptation strategies will be necessary to maintain current levels of production in the face of groundwater depletion.
Groundwater depletion will reduce cropping intensity in India, and canal irrigation cannot fully substitute for this loss.

Here, we introduce the concept of fluvial synchrogram to formulate and test expectations regarding the geography of metapopulation synchrony across watersheds. By combining theoretical simulations and an extensive fish population time-series dataset across Europe, we provide evidence that fish metapopulations can be buffered against synchronous dynamics as a direct consequence of network connectivity and branching complexity. Synchrony was higher between populations connected by direct water flow and decayed faster with distance over the Euclidean than the watercourse dimension. Likewise, synchrony decayed faster with distance in headwater than mainstem populations of the same basin. As network topology and flow directionality generate fundamental spatial patterns of synchrony in fish metapopulations, empirical synchrograms can aid knowledge advancement and inform conservation strategies in complex habitats.},

Virtually all ecological sub-disciplines recognise the critical value of looking at species and communities from a functional perspective, and this has led to a proliferation of methods for estimating contrasting dimensions of functional diversity. Differences between these methods and their development generated terminological inconsistencies and confusion about the selection of the most appropriate approach for addressing any particular ecological question, hampering the potential for comparative studies, simulation exercises and meta-analyses. Two general mathematical frameworks for estimating functional diversity are prevailing: those based on dissimilarity matrices (e.g. Rao entropy, functional dendrograms) and those relying on multidimensional spaces, constructed as either convex hulls or probabilistic hypervolumes. We review these frameworks, discuss their strengths and weaknesses and provide an overview of the main R packages performing these calculations. In parallel, we propose a way for organising functional diversity metrics in a unified scheme to quantify the richness, divergence and regularity of species or individuals under each framework.

	abstract = {Simple models in theoretical ecology have a long-standing history of being used to understand how specific processes influence population dynamics as well as providing a foundation for future endeavors. The Levins model is the seminal example of this for continuous-time metapopulation dynamics. However, many natural populations have a distinct separation between processes and data is not collected continuously leading to the need for using a discrete-time model. Our goal is to develop a simple discrete-time metapopulation model of patch occupancy using difference equations. In our formulation, we consider the two fundamental processes of colonization and extinction that will be treated as sequential events and will only consider patch occupancy. To achieve this, we use a composition of two functions where one will reflect the extinction process and the other for the colonization process. Under some mild assumptions, we are able determine the dynamic behavior of the metapopulation. In addition, we provide numerous examples for the functions used to emulate the colonization and extinction processes. Our results illustrate that the dynamics of the model are tied to properties such as convexity and monotonicity of the colonization and extinction functions. In particular, if the model is non-monotone, then complex dynamics can arise such as cyclic and even chaotic behavior. Overall, our approach shows how certain properties of the colonization and extinction functions can influence metapopulation dynamics.},

	abstract = {One approach to stabilise small and declining populations is to breed individuals in captivity and release them into the wild to reinforce existing populations while working to reduce threats. Population reinforcement programmes require long-term commitments to be successful and can divert limited resources from other conservation measures. A rigorous evaluation whether reinforcement can stabilise a population is therefore essential to justify investments. Many migratory species incur high mortality during their first migration, and releasing captive-bred birds at an older age may therefore benefit reinforcement programmes for migratory birds. We examine whether a small and declining population of a long-distance migratory raptor—the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus—can be stabilised using population reinforcement that reduces mortality during the first migration. We used an integrated population model to evaluate realistic reinforcement and survival improvement scenarios to estimate how many captive-bred birds would need to be released to stabilise the population. Survival probability of wild juveniles during their first year (0.296; 95\% CI 0.234–0.384) was too low for a stable population (population growth rate 0.949; 95\% CI 0.940–0.956), but captive-bred juveniles released in their second calendar year had improved survival (0.566; 95\% CI 0.265–0.862) during their first year in the wild. Reinforcement of 15 birds per year for 30 years was insufficient to achieve a neutral or positive population growth rate. However, reinforcement reduced the probability of extinction by 2049 from 48\% without reinforcement to {\textless}1\% if 12 or more birds were released every year for 30 years. A 6\% increase in annual survival probability would likely lead to a stable population without any reinforcement. Synthesis and applications. Although releasing captive-bred birds can reduce high juvenile mortality during first migration and assist in postponing local extinction, further improvements of survival in the wild are required to safeguard a migratory population where threats in the wild will persist for decades despite management.},

Specifically, how has diminished wild abundance and increased artificial production (i.e. enhancement) changed portfolios of salmon populations, and how might such change influence fisheries and ecosystems? We apply modern genetic tools to century-old sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka scales from Canada's Skeena River watershed to (a) reconstruct historical abundance and age-trait data for 1913–1947 to compare with recent information, (b) quantify changes in population and life-history diversity and the role of enhancement in population dynamics, and (c) quantify the risk to fisheries and local ecosystems resulting from observed changes in diversity and enhancement. The total number of wild sockeye returning to the Skeena River during the modern era is 69\% lower than during the historical era; all wild populations have declined, several by more than 90\%. However, enhancement of a single population has offset declines in wild populations such that aggregate abundances now are similar to historical levels. Population diversity has declined by 70\%, and life-history diversity has shifted: populations are migrating from freshwater at an earlier age, and spending more time in the ocean. There also has been a contraction in abundance throughout the watershed, which likely has decreased the spatial extent of salmon provisions to Indigenous fisheries and local ecosystems. Despite the erosion of portfolio strength that this salmon complex hosted a century ago, total returns now are no more variable than they were historically perhaps in part due to the stabilizing effect of artificial production. Policy implications. Our study provides a rare example of the extent of erosion of within-species biodiversity over the last century of human influence. Rebuilding a diversity of abundant wild populations—that is, maintaining functioning portfolios—may help ensure that watershed complexes like the Skeena are robust to global change.},

	abstract = {Understanding how climate change impacts trailing-edge populations requires information about how abiotic and biotic factors limit their distributions. Theory indicates that socially mediated Allee effects can limit species distributions by suppressing growth rates of peripheral populations when social information is scarce. The goal of our research was to determine if socially mediated Allee effects limit the distribution of Canada warbler Cardellina canadensis at the trailing-edge of the geographic range. Using 4 years of observational data from 71 sites and experimental data at 10 sites, we tested two predictions of the socially mediated range limitation hypothesis: (a) local growth rates should be positively correlated with local density and (b) the addition of social cues immediately outside the trailing-edge range boundary would result in colonization of formerly unoccupied habitat and increased growth rates. During the third breeding season, social cues were experimentally added at 10 formerly unoccupied sites within and beyond the species’ local range margin to determine if the addition of social information could increase density and effectively expand the species’ range. No experimental sites were colonized after adding social cues and no evidence of Allee effects was found. Rather, temperature, precipitation and negative density dependence strongly influenced population growth rates. Although theoretical models indicate that the presence of socially mediated Allee effects at species range boundaries could increase the rate of climate-induced range shifts and local extinctions, empirical results from the first test of this hypothesis suggest that Allee effects play a minimal role in limiting species’ distributions.},

During the past two decades, the field has increasingly made use of machine learning approaches for constructing and validating SDMs. Model accuracy has steadily increased as a result, but the interpretability of the fitted models, for example the relative importance of predictor variables or their causal effects on focal species, has not always kept pace. Here we draw attention to an emerging subdiscipline of artificial intelligence, explainable AI (xAI), as a toolbox for better interpreting SDMs. xAI aims at deciphering the behavior of complex statistical or machine learning models (e.g. neural networks, random forests, boosted regression trees), and can produce more transparent and understandable SDM predictions. We describe the rationale behind xAI and provide a list of tools that can be used to help ecological modelers better understand complex model behavior at different scales. As an example, we perform a reproducible SDM analysis in R on the African elephant and showcase some xAI tools such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) to help interpret local-scale behavior of the model. We conclude with what we see as the benefits and caveats of these techniques and advocate for their use to improve the interpretability of machine learning SDMs.},

Since immigration history is rarely known, these historical influences, or priority effects, pose a major challenge in predicting community assembly. Here, we provide a graph-based, non-parametric, theoretical framework for understanding the predictability of community assembly as affected by priority effects. To develop this framework, we first show that the diversity of possible priority effects increases super-exponentially with the number of species. We then point out that, despite this diversity, the consequences of priority effects for multispecies communities can be classified into four basic types, each of which reduces community predictability: alternative stable states, alternative transient paths, compositional cycles and the lack of escapes from compositional cycles to stable states. Using a neural network, we show that this classification of priority effects enables accurate explanation of community predictability, particularly when each species immigrates repeatedly. We also demonstrate the empirical utility of our theoretical framework by applying it to two experimentally derived assembly graphs of algal and ciliate communities. Based on these analyses, we discuss how the framework proposed here can help guide experimental investigation of the predictability of history-dependent community assembly.},

Yet, efforts to quantify the relative role of immigration on population growth across the entire range of species and over time have been lacking. We assessed whether immigration limited local and range-wide population growth of the endangered snail kite Rostrhamus sociabilis in Florida, USA, over 18 years using multi-state, reverse-time modelling that accounts for imperfect detection of individuals and unobservable states. Demographic contributions of immigration varied depending on the dynamics and geographic position of the local populations, were scale-dependent and changed over time. By comparing the relative contributions of immigration versus local demography for periods of significant change in local abundance, we found empirical evidence for a disproportionately large role of immigration in facilitating population growth of a centrally located population—a connectivity ‘hub’. The importance of connectivity changed depending of the spatial scale considered, such that immigration was a more important driver of population growth at small versus large spatial scales. Furthermore, the contribution of immigration was much greater during time periods when local population size was small, emphasizing abundance-dependent rescue effects. Our findings suggest that efforts aimed at improving local breeding habitat will likely be most effective at increasing snail kite population growth. More broadly, our results provide much needed information on the role of connectivity for population growth, suggesting that connectivity conservation may have the greatest benefits when efforts focus on centrally located habitat patches and small populations. Furthermore, our results highlight that connectivity is highly dynamic over time and that interpreting the effects of connectivity at local scales may not transfer to region-wide dynamics.},

Since differences in community composition often lead to differences in community function, understanding compositional multistability is essential to comprehend the role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystems. In community assembly studies, it has long been recognized that the order and timing of species migration and extinction influence structure and function of communities. The study of multistability in ecology has focused on the change in dynamical stability across environmental gradients, and was developed mainly for low-dimensional systems. As a result, methodologies for studying the compositional stability of empirical multispecies communities are not well developed. Here, we show that models previously used in ecology can be analyzed from a new perspective, the energy landscape, to unveil compositional stability in observational data. To show that our method can be applicable to real-world ecological communities, we simulated assembly dynamics driven by population-level processes, and show that results were mostly robust to different simulation assumptions. Our method reliably captured the change in the overall compositional stability of multispecies communities over environmental change, and indicated a small fraction of community compositions that may be channels for transitions between stable states. When applied to murine gut microbiota, our method showed the presence of two alternative states whose relationship changes with age, and suggested mechanisms by which aging affects the compositional stability of the murine gut microbiota. Our method provides a practical tool to study the compositional stability of communities in a changing world, and will facilitate empirical studies that integrate the concept of multistability from different fields.},

Natural disturbance, such as river flooding, is known to stimulate dispersal behaviour, but its interactive effects with individual-level characteristics (e.g. body size) of potential dispersers remain elusive. It is critical to fill this knowledge gap because anthropogenic impacts (including climate change) alter both disturbance regimes and population structures. Here, we examined how extreme high flows and individual body size combined to influence dispersal of three fishes (creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus, bluehead chub Nocomis leptocephalus, and striped jumprock Moxostoma rupicartes) in two streams (740 and 520 m long) in South Carolina, U.S.A. We focused on extreme high flows as a natural disturbance, whereas body size was used as an individual-level characteristic of dispersers. A total of 5,604 individuals were uniquely marked in the two streams over a {\textgreater}2-year study period, during which sampling occurred every 2 months. The intensive capture–recapture study revealed differential effects of disturbance and body size among sympatric stream fishes. Extreme high flows increased dispersal of striped jumprock and creek chub, whereas body size influenced dispersal of striped jumprock with larger individuals traveling longer distances. Bluehead chub showed a complex dispersal response. That is, size-dependence in dispersal emerged only during high-flow periods. The results of this study build upon previous efforts by providing field-based evidence of how disturbance and individual characteristics (body size) combine to drive non-random dispersal and how it varies among sympatric species. This finding is important because metapopulations that are maintained by different non-random dispersal (i.e. externally or internally driven) may show varied sensitivities to human-induced environmental changes.},

We are increasingly aware of human impacts on biodiversity across our planet, especially in terrestrial and marine systems. We know less about fresh waters, including large rivers. Su et al. looked across such systems globally, focusing on several key measures of fish biodiversity. They found that half of all river systems have been heavily affected by human activities, with only very large tropical river basins receiving the lowest levels of change. Fragmentation and non-native species have also led to the homogenization of rivers, with many now containing similar species and fewer specialized lineages.
Science, this issue p. 835
Freshwater fish represent one-fourth of the world’s vertebrates and provide irreplaceable goods and services but are increasingly affected by human activities. A new index, Cumulative Change in Biodiversity Facets, revealed marked changes in biodiversity in {\textgreater}50\% of the world’s rivers covering {\textgreater}40\% of the world’s continental surface and {\textgreater}37\% of the world’s river length, whereas {\textless}14\% of the world’s surface and river length remain least impacted. Present-day rivers are more similar to each other and have more fish species with more diverse morphologies and longer evolutionary legacies. In temperate rivers, where the impact has been greatest, biodiversity changes were primarily due to river fragmentation and introduction of non-native species.
Present-day rivers have become more similar to each other, having more fish species with more diverse morphologies.

	abstract = {Local assemblages are embedded in networks of communities connected by dispersal, and understanding the processes that mediate this local–regional interaction is central to understanding biodiversity patterns. In this network (i.e. metacommunity), the strength of dispersal relative to the intensity of environmental selection typically determines whether local communities are comprised of species well-adapted to the local environment (i.e. species sorting) or are dominated by regionally successful species that may not be locally adapted (i.e. mass effects), which by extension determines the capacity of the landscape to sustain diversity. Despite the fundamentally spatial nature of these dispersal-mediated processes, much of our theoretical understanding comes from spatially implicit systems, a special case of spatial structure in which patches are all connected to each other equally. In many real systems, both the connections among patches (i.e. network topology) and the distributions of environments across patches (i.e. spatial autocorrelation) are not arranged uniformly. Here, we use a metacommunity model to investigate how spatial heterogeneities may change the balance between species sorting versus mass effects and diversity outcomes. Our simulations show that, in general, the spatially implicit model generates an outlier in biodiversity patterns compared to other networks, and most likely amplifies mass effects relative to species sorting. Network topology has a strong effect on metacommunity outcome, with topologies of sparse connections and few loops promoting sorting of species into suitable patches. Spatial autocorrelation is another key factor; by interacting with spatial topology, intermediate-scale clusters of similar patches can emerge, leading to a reduction of regional competition, and hence maintenance of gamma diversity. These results provide a better understanding of the role that complex spatial landscape structure plays in metacommunity processes, a necessary step to understanding how metacommunity processes relate to biodiversity conservation.},

Organismal traits that determine individual performance and ecological interactions are essential for scaling up environmental responses from individuals to ecosystems. We combine protist microcosm experiments and mathematical models to show that key traits—cell size, shape, and contents—each explain different aspects of species’ demographic responses to changes in temperature. These differences in species’ temperature responses have complex cascading effects across levels of organization—causing nonlinear shifts in total community respiration rates across temperatures via coordinated changes in community composition, equilibrium densities, and community–mean species mass in experimental protist communities that tightly match theoretical predictions. Our results suggest that traits explain variation in population growth, and together, these two factors scale up to influence community- and ecosystem-level processes across temperatures. Connecting the multilevel microbial processes that ultimately influence climate in this way will help refine predictions about complex ecosystem–climate feedbacks and the pace of climate change itself.},

According to one influential hypothesis, intense competition for food among large numbers of spatially constrained foragers should result in a zone of prey depletion surrounding such colonies, ultimately limiting their size. However, while indirect and theoretical support for this phenomenon, known as “Ashmole’s halo,” has steadily accumulated, direct evidence remains exceptionally scarce. Using a combination of vessel-based surveys and Global Positioning System tracking, we show that pelagic seabirds breeding at the tropical island that first inspired Ashmole’s hypothesis do indeed deplete their primary prey species (flying fish; Exocoetidae spp.) over a considerable area, with reduced prey density detectable {\textgreater}150 km from the colony. The observed prey gradient was mirrored by an opposing trend in seabird foraging effort, could not be explained by confounding environmental variability, and can be approximated using a mechanistic consumption–dispersion model, incorporating realistic rates of seabird predation and random prey dispersal.

We illustrate the practical utility of this approach by analyzing a forest–savanna model. Savanna and forest states coexist under certain conditions, consistent with past theoretical work and empirical observations. However, a grassland state, unseen in the corresponding deterministic model, emerges as an alternative quasi-stable state under fluctuations, providing a theoretical basis for the appearance of widespread grasslands in some empirical analyses. The ecological dynamics are determined by both the population-potential landscape gradient and the steady-state probability flux. The flux quantifies the net input/output to the ecological system and therefore the degree of nonequilibriumness. Landscape and flux together determine the transitions between stable states characterized by dominant paths and switching rates. The intrinsic potential landscape admits a Lyapunov function, which provides a quantitative measure of global stability. We find that the average flux, entropy production rate, and free energy have significant changes near bifurcations under both finite and zero fluctuation. These may provide both dynamical and thermodynamic origins of the bifurcations. We identified the variances in observed frequency time traces, fluctuations, and time irreversibility as kinematic measures for bifurcations. This framework opens the way to characterize ecological systems globally, to uncover how they change among states, and to quantify the emergence of quasi-stable states under stochastic fluctuations.},

Therefore, quantifying the main assembly processes in various systems and across different datasets has remained challenging. Building on the PER-SIMPER method, we propose a new metric, the dispersal–niche continuum index (DNCI), which estimates whether dispersal or niche processes dominate community assembly and facilitates the comparisons of processes among datasets. The DNCI was tested for robustness using simulations and applied to observational datasets comprising organismal groups with different trophic level and dispersal potential. Based on the robustness tests, the DNCI discriminated the respective contribution of niche and dispersal processes in pairwise comparisons of site groups with less than 40\% and 30\% differences in their taxa and site numbers, respectively. In the observational datasets, the DNCI suggested that dispersal rather than niche assembly was the dominant assembly process which, however, varied in intensity among organismal groups and study contexts, including spatial scale and ecosystem types. The proposed DNCI measures the relative strength of community assembly processes in a way that is simple, easily quantifiable and comparable across datasets. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the DNCI and provide perspectives for future research.},

However, previous lotic food web studies have been limited by geographic coverage or methodological constraints. We used compound-specific stable carbon isotope analysis of amino acids (AAs) to estimate basal resource contributions to fish consumers in streams spanning grassland, montane and semi-arid ecoregions of the temperate steppe biome on two continents. Across a range of stream sizes and light regimes, we found consistent trophic importance of aquatic resources. Essential AAs of heterotrophic microbial origin generally provided secondary support for fishes, while terrestrial carbon did not seem to provide significant, direct support. These findings provide strong evidence for the dominant contribution of carbon to higher-order consumers by aquatic autochthonous resources (primarily) and heterotrophic microbial communities (secondarily) in temperate steppe streams.},

	abstract = {Non-perennial streams are widespread, critical to ecosystems and society, and the subject of ongoing policy debate. Prior large-scale research on stream intermittency has been based on long-term averages, generally using annually aggregated data to characterize a highly variable process. As a result, it is not well understood if, how, or why the hydrology of non-perennial streams is changing. Here, we investigate trends and drivers of three intermittency signatures that describe the duration, timing, and dry-down period of stream intermittency across the continental United States (CONUS). Half of gages exhibited a significant trend through time in at least one of the three intermittency signatures, and changes in no-flow duration were most pervasive (41\% of gages). Changes in intermittency were substantial for many streams, and 7\% of gages exhibited changes in annual no-flow duration exceeding 100 days during the study period. Distinct regional patterns of change were evident, with widespread drying in southern CONUS and wetting in northern CONUS. These patterns are correlated with changes in aridity, though drivers of spatiotemporal variability were diverse across the three intermittency signatures. While the no-flow timing and duration were strongly related to climate, dry-down period was most strongly related to watershed land use and physiography. Our results indicate that non-perennial conditions are increasing in prevalence over much of CONUS and binary classifications of ‘perennial’ and ‘non-perennial’ are not an accurate reflection of this change. Water management and policy should reflect the changing nature and diverse drivers of changing intermittency both today and in the future.},

Robust assessment of these management experiments should consider impacts to both donor and recipient populations and compare the cost-effectiveness of translocations to other actions. Here we evaluate the translocations of a federally listed fish species, humpback chub within a tributary to the Colorado River in its Grand Canyon reach (Arizona, USA). We analyse mark–recapture data with multistate models to estimate vital rates (growth, survival and movement) for the donor and recipient populations while accounting for substantial temporal variation in vital rates. We then use stochastic matrix projections to quantify the impact of translocations on adult population size. Lastly, we compare the costs of translocations to another, legally required management action, non-native fish removal, by modifying an existing bioeconomic model. We estimate that six of eight translocations during the study period positively impacted adult abundance and that the overall population impact was positive. Population projections suggest that each chub translocated per year increases the equilibrium adult population size by 1.2 (95\% CI: 0.4–2.2) adults, lessening the need for non-native fish removal. The continuation of translocations at the current rate is expected to save managers \$50,000 per year by decreasing the annual probability of removals from 0.26 to 0.15. Further savings and decreases in removals could be attained by avoiding translocations in years when there has been no winter/spring runoff and modifying the number of translocated individuals based on the estimates of juvenile production in the lower Little Colorado River. Synthesis and applications. Translocations that increase the abundance of a rare species can sometimes be viewed as a hedge against future declines that might necessitate more costly interventions. Quantifying population benefits and economic costs of management actions like translocations and comparing alternative actions can lead to cost-effective conservation that is more easily sustained.},

Here, we investigate how habitat connectivity and habitat heterogeneity affect phenotypic differentiation by formulating a stochastic eco-evolutionary model where individuals are structured over a spatial graph. We combine analytical insights into the eco-evolutionary dynamics with numerical simulations to understand how the graph topology and the spatial distribution of habitat types affect differentiation. We show that not only low connectivity but also heterogeneity in connectivity promotes neutral differentiation, due to increased competition in highly connected vertices. Habitat assortativity, a measure of habitat spatial auto-correlation in graphs, additionally drives differentiation under habitat-dependent selection. While assortative graphs systematically amplify adaptive differentiation, they can foster or depress neutral differentiation depending on the migration regime. By formalising the eco-evolutionary and spatial dynamics of biological populations on graphs, our study establishes fundamental links between landscape features and phenotypic differentiation.},

However, many closely related species instead show substantial differences across categorically different traits. We present a model of secondary contact whereby females maintain preferences for distinct displays that indicate both male condition and their match to distinct environments, fostering reproductive isolation among diverging species. This occurs even with search costs and with independent preference loci targeting independent displays. Such preferences can also evolve from standing variation. Divergence occurs because condition-dependent display and female preference depend on local ecology, and females obtain different benefits of choice. Given the ubiquity of ecological differences among environments, our model could help explain the evolution of striking radiations of displays seen in nature.},

	abstract = {In ecology, multifunctionality metrics measure the simultaneous performance of multiple ecosystem functions. If species diversity describes the variety of species that together build the ecosystem, multifunctionality attempts to describe the variety of functions these species perform. A range of methods have been proposed to quantify multifunctionality, successively attempting to alleviate problems that have been identified with the previous methods. This has led to a proliferation of more-or-less closely related metrics which, however, lack an overarching theoretical framework. Here we borrow from the comprehensive framework of species diversity to derive a new metric of multifunctionality. Analogously to the effective number of species used to quantify species diversity, the metric we propose is influenced both by the number of functions as well as, crucially, the evenness of performance levels across functions. In addition, the effective multifunctionality also considers the average level at which the functions are performed. The result is a measure of the cumulative performance of the system were all functions provided equally. The framework allows for the inclusion of the correlation structure among functions, thus allowing it to account for non-independence between functions. We show that the average metric is a special case of the newly proposed metric when all functions are uncorrelated and performed at equal levels. We hope that by providing a new metric of multifunctionality anchored in the rigorous framework of species diversity based on effective numbers, we will overcome the considerable skepticism that the larger community of ecologists has built against indices of multifunctionality. We thereby hope to help popularize this important concept which, like biological diversity, describes a fundamental property of ecosystems and thus lies at the heart of ecology.},

However, the composite variability at the community scale is expected to be tempered by opposing fluctuations in individual populations, a phenomenon often called the portfolio effect. Understanding population variability, how it scales to community variability, and the spatial scaling in this variability are pressing needs given shifting environmental conditions and community composition. We explore evidence for portfolio effects using null community simulations and a large collection of empirical community time series from the BioTIME database. Additionally, we explore the relative roles of habitat type and geographic location on population and community temporal variability. We find strong portfolio effects in our theoretical community model, but weak effects in empirical data, suggesting a role for shared environmental responses, interspecific competition, or a litany of other factors. Furthermore, we observe a clear latitudinal signal – and differences among habitat types – in population and community variability. Together, this highlights the need to develop realistic models of community dynamics, and hints at spatial, and underlying environmental, gradients in variability in both population and community dynamics.},

While rivers’ scaling features are captured by Optimal Channel Networks, knowledge on adequate network topologies has hitherto been only partially transferred across geo- and biosciences. Consequently, ecologists have often studied riverine populations via random networks not respecting real rivers’ scaling character. Here we show that an alleged property of such random networks (branching probability) is a scale-dependent quantity that does not reflect any recognized metric of rivers’ fractal character, and hence cannot be a driver of ecological dynamics. Moreover, we show that random networks lead to biased estimates of population stability and persistence, while only Optimal Channel Networks yield estimates comparable to real rivers. We hence advocate Optimal Channel Networks as model landscapes for realistic and generalizable projections of ecohydrological dynamics in riverine networks.},

One day after stocking, mean stomach content weight of charr was six times higher than in unstocked streams due to fry consumption. In particular, large charr showed intense piscivory. However, predation on fry was rare after about three weeks. Some factors that could explain this time-limited IG predation include the growth and decreasing abundance of fry over time and the acquisition of predator-avoidance behaviour. In days other than the first-day post-stocking, food intake by charr did not differ between stocked and unstocked streams. No effects of interspecific competition on charr food intake were observed.},

	abstract = {Positive biotic interactions are recognized as important factors determining species distributions. Although effects of positive interactions have often been observed at local scales, much less is known about consequences at larger spatial scales. Here, we study nest associations of stream fishes – widespread reproductive facilitation between host (nest-builder) and beneficiary (nest associate) species in North America – as a model system to examine the role of positive interactions in determining the metapopulation-level relationship between host and beneficiary species. Using regional data of fish distribution in the Midwestern US, we found that watershed-level occupancy of host species (i.e. metapopulation occupancy) remarkably increased that of nest associates. Our results illustrated that the effects of positive biotic interactions at the metapopulation level were comparable or even stronger than environmental drivers, i.e. factors that have been studied most extensively in metapopulation studies. Further, our model supported the hypothesis that the metapopulation-level relationship between hosts and nest associates was mediated by a gradient of environmental conditions: strong associations occurred under stressful habitats. This study provides insightful evidence that positive biotic interactions have larger scale consequences for distributions of organisms than previously thought. Successful biodiversity conservation may need a broader framework that appreciates the role of positive biotic interactions at larger spatial scales.},

However, its ecological impact has rarely been quantified in the Northern Hemisphere, as broad-scale conversion to farmland mainly occurred until the 1400s–1700s in the region, limiting the availability of sufficient data. The Ishikari Lowland in Hokkaido, Japan, offers an excellent opportunity to address this issue, as hunter–gatherer lifestyles dominated this region until the mid-nineteenth century and land cover maps are available for the period of land cover changes (i.e. 1850–2016). Using these maps and a hierarchical community model of relationships between breeding bird abundance and land cover types, we estimated that broad-scale land cover change over a 166-year period was associated with more than 70\% decline in both potential species richness and abundance of avian communities. We estimated that the abundance of wetland and forest species declined by greater than 88\%, whereas that of bare-ground/farmland species increased by more than 50\%. Our results suggest that broad-scale land cover change for agriculture has led to drastic reductions in wetland and forest species and promoted changes in community composition in large parts of the Northern Hemisphere.

However, how the presence or non-presence of these trophic cascades may affect interactions across the aquatic–terrestrial interface remains poorly investigated. Pollinators such as bees may be especially vulnerable to changes in water resource quality induced by trophic cascades. Understanding how aquatic trophic cascades affect bees and pollination becomes even more pressing under ongoing climate change due to increased physiological demands for water under extreme weather events. In a novel field experiment combining terrestrial and aquatic mesocosms, we aimed to test how changes in water quality induced by an aquatic trophic cascade affected foraging and growth of bumblebee colonies as well as foraging of solitary bees. While we expected fish predation to reduce top–down control of zooplankton on phytoplankton and thereby, indirectly, induce increased growth of toxic cyanobacteria, we instead found the trophic cascade to induce the formation of algal surface mats that bumblebees used to access water under a severe heat wave and drought. This access to water was associated with higher bumblebee colony reproductive success, growth and weight compared to control colonies with no trophic cascade induced (and hence no algal surface mats). We also found marginal but non-significant effects on oilseed rape yield, but surprisingly with higher yields in the control treatment where bumblebees could not access water. Our results provide new insights on how aquatic trophic cascades can lead to unpredicted ecological interactions across the aquatic–terrestrial interface facilitated by climate change. Our study highlights the importance of water for the fitness of terrestrial ecosystem service providers under altered environmental conditions.},

Here we capitalize on a recently developed theory of random self-similar trees to elucidate the origin of Horton's laws, Hack's laws, basin fractal dimensions, power-law distributions of link attributes, and power-law relations between distinct attributes. In particular, we introduce a one-parametric family of self-similar critical Tokunaga trees that includes the celebrated Shreve's random topology model and extends to trees that approximate the observed river networks with realistic exponents. The results offer tools to increase our understanding of landscape organization under different hydroclimatic forcings, and to extend scaling relationships useful for hydrologic prediction to resolutions higher than those observed.},

In riverine ecosystems, factors that vary through space and time, such as flow, the presence of barriers to movement, and network topology determine connectivity, and in turn shape patterns of diversity and richness. While the effects of network topology and changes in spatiotemporal connectivity regimes on patterns of species richness have been studied in isolation, they have not been studied simultaneously. We used a discrete-time logistic growth metacommunity model to analyze the role of spatial and temporal functional connectivity in determining patterns of local (patch level) species richness in freshwater fish metacommunities. Our modeling suggests that: (1) the effect of spatial loss of connectivity on local species richness is mediated by network topology and where richness is measured in the system and (2) increasing temporal autocorrelation in connectivity results in increasing temporal autocorrelation in patch occupancy. Spatial and temporal loss of connectivity is a ubiquitous issue for river ecosystems, making understanding and predicting its effects of fundamental importance to both improving theory and guiding river management. Our findings highlight the importance of network topology (and hence context dependency) in shaping metacommunity response to changing connectivity regimes.},

Yet, FD has many facets and their estimations are not standardized nor embedded in a single tool. mFD (multifaceted functional diversity) is an R package that uses matrices of species assemblages and species trait values as building blocks to compute most FD indices. mFD is firstly based on two functions allowing the user to summarize trait and assemblage data. Then it calculates trait-based distances between species pairs, informs the user whether species have to be clustered into functional entities and finally computes multidimensional functional space. To let the user choose the most appropriate functional space for computing multidimensional functional diversity indices, two mFD functions allow assessing and illustrating the quality of each functional space. Next, mFD provides 6 core functions to calculate 16 existing FD indices based on trait-based distances, functional entities or species position in a functional space. The mFD package also provides graphical functions based on the ggplot library to illustrate FD values through customizable and high-resolution plots of species distribution among functional entities or in a multidimensional space. All functions include internal validation processes to check for errors in data formatting which return detailed error messages. To facilitate the use of mFD framework, we built an associated website hosting five tutorials illustrating the use of all the functions step by step.},

Top predators have been proposed as reliable biodiversity signposts, but their role is controversial. Here, we verified their performance by a meta-analysis of published studies and found solid support for their efficacy as biodiversity indicators. As to be expected for any indicator species, efficacy was stronger for biodiversity components ‘ecologically closer’ to the predator (i.e. broad groups that include species providing key resources, such as avian and tree diversity for a bird-eating predator that nests in trees) and declined for the diversity of components more ‘ecologically remote’ from the predator (e.g. butterfly diversity for a fish-eating predator). This confirmed a link between the top predatory role and biodiversity and set the context for its functionality. These results show that, on average, top predators are justified candidates as biodiversity indicators and that prioritisation of conservation action based on their occurrence is likely to provide broader ecosystem benefits. However, such role should be confirmed on a case-by-case basis, acknowledging that no indicator can portray everything, checking the compatibility of the biodiversity components linked to the predator with the established conservation objectives and ideally integrating predators with other complementary indicator groups.},

Increasing variation in key ecological processes can signal impending state shifts in ecosystems. In a rocky intertidal meta-ecosystem consisting of three distinct regions spread across 260 km of the Oregon coast, we show that annually cleared sites are characterized by communities that exhibit signs of increasing destabilization (loss of resilience) over the past decade despite persistent community states. In all cases, recovery rates slowed and became more variable over time. The conditions underlying these shifts appear to be external to the system, with thermal disruptions (e.g., marine heat waves, El Niño–Southern Oscillation) and shifts in ocean currents (e.g., upwelling) being the likely proximate drivers. Although this iconic ecosystem has long appeared resistant to stress, the evidence suggests that subtle destabilization has occurred over at least the last decade.},

In this meta-analysis, by synthesising the results of 103 studies that were distributed globally and conducted at various spatial scales, we revealed a latitudinal gradient in the detectable assembly processes of vascular plant communities. Variations in plant community composition at low and high latitudes were mainly explained by geographic variables, suggesting that distance decay and dispersal limitations causing spatial aggregation are influential in these regions. In contrast, variation in species composition correlated most strongly with environmental variables at mid-latitudes (20–30°), reflecting the importance of environmental filtering, although this unimodal pattern was not statistically significant. Importantly, our analysis revealed the effects of different spatial scales, such that the correlation with spatial variables was stronger at smaller sampling extents, and environmental variables were more influential at larger sampling extents. We concluded that plant communities are driven by different community assembly processes in distinct biogeographical regions, suggesting that the latitudinal gradient of biodiversity is created by a combination of multiple processes that vary with environmental and species size differences.},

Here, we used logistic population growth models and an empirical reindeer case study to show that low to moderate harvesting can actually buffer populations against environmental perturbations. This occurs because of density-dependent environmental stochasticity, where negative environmental impacts on vital rates are amplified at high population density due to intra-specific resource competition. Simulations from our population models show that even low levels of harvesting may prevent overabundance, thereby dampening population fluctuations and reducing the risk of population collapse and quasi-extinction following environmental perturbations. Thus, depending on the species' life history and the strength of density-dependent environmental drivers, low to moderate harvesting can improve population resistance to increased climate variability and extreme weather expected under global warming.},

	abstract = {In the absence of environmental heterogeneity, spatial variation among local communities can be mostly attributed to random dispersal, demographic stochasticity and species interactions causing historical contingency in colonization (e.g. priority effects). The consequences of demographic stochasticity and random dispersal are highly dependent on community size, regional richness and local richness, which, along with historical contingency can be strongly affected by spatial isolation and the presence of predators. Here, we tested whether and how the presence of a generalist predatory fish and spatial isolation can change spatial community variability in artificial ponds by manipulating the presence/absence of fish (redbreast tilapia) at three different distances from a source wetland. We then used null models to compute how much the observed community variability within treatments deviates from the expected from randomly reassembled communities (i.e. beta-deviation). We found that spatial isolation can have both negative and positive effects on community variability, and their importance may depend on the presence of predatory fish. Negative effects likely occurred because predatory insects cannot always successfully colonize highly isolated ponds, causing the abundance of herbivores and detritivores to increase, consequently increasing community size, which is known to decrease the importance of demographic stochasticity. However, when fish are absent, the more isolated communities exhibit more community variability than is expected from random community assembly. We believe that such an increase in variability is most likely due to an increase in the importance of historical contingency in colonization, generating more distinct communities in isolated ponds. Such effects were absent in the presence of generalist predatory fish, likely because fish prevented any early colonizing taxa from becoming too abundant. Our findings show that the presence of generalist predators can change how community variability responds to spatial isolation.},

	abstract = {A network consists of two interdependent parts: the network topology or graph, consisting of the links between nodes and the network dynamics, specified by some governing equations. A crucial challenge is the prediction of dynamics on networks, such as forecasting the spread of an infectious disease on a human contact network. Unfortunately, an accurate prediction of the dynamics seems hardly feasible, because the network is often complicated and unknown. In this work, given past observations of the dynamics on a fixed graph, we show the contrary: Even without knowing the network topology, we can predict the dynamics. Specifically, for a general class of deterministic governing equations, we propose a two-step prediction algorithm. First, we obtain a surrogate network by fitting past observations of every nodal state to the dynamical model. Second, we iterate the governing equations on the surrogate network to predict the dynamics. Surprisingly, even though there is no similarity between the surrogate topology and the true topology, the predictions are accurate, for a considerable prediction time horizon, for a broad range of observation times, and in the presence of a reasonable noise level. The true topology is not needed for predicting dynamics on networks, since the dynamics evolve in a subspace of astonishingly low dimension compared to the size and heterogeneity of the graph.

	abstract = {Spatiotemporally consistent data on global cropland extent is essential for tracking progress towards sustainable food production. In the present study, we present an analysis of global cropland area change for the first two decades of the twenty-first century derived from satellite data time-series. We estimate that, in 2019, the cropland area was 1,244 Mha with a corresponding total annual net primary production (NPP) of 5.5 Pg C year−1. From 2003 to 2019, cropland area increased by 9\% and cropland NPP by 25\%, primarily due to agricultural expansion in Africa and South America. Global cropland expansion accelerated over the past two decades, with a near doubling of the annual expansion rate, most notably in Africa. Half of the new cropland area (49\%) replaced natural vegetation and tree cover, indicating a conflict with the sustainability goal of protecting terrestrial ecosystems. From 2003 to 2019, global per-capita cropland area decreased by 10\% due to population growth. However, the per-capita annual cropland NPP increased by 3.5\% as a result of intensified agricultural land use. The presented global, high-resolution, cropland map time-series supports monitoring of natural land appropriation at the local, national and international levels.},

	abstract = {The widespread extirpation of megafauna may have destabilized ecosystems and altered biodiversity globally. Most megafauna extinctions occurred before the modern record, leaving it unclear how their loss impacts current biodiversity. We report the long-term effects of reintroducing plains bison (Bison bison) in a tallgrass prairie versus two land uses that commonly occur in many North American grasslands: 1) no grazing and 2) intensive growing-season grazing by domesticated cattle (Bos taurus). Compared to ungrazed areas, reintroducing bison increased native plant species richness by 103\% at local scales (10 m2) and 86\% at the catchment scale. Gains in richness continued for 29 y and were resilient to the most extreme drought in four decades. These gains are now among the largest recorded increases in species richness due to grazing in grasslands globally. Grazing by domestic cattle also increased native plant species richness, but by less than half as much as bison. This study indicates that some ecosystems maintain a latent potential for increased native plant species richness following the reintroduction of native herbivores, which was unmatched by domesticated grazers. Native-grazer gains in richness were resilient to an extreme drought, a pressure likely to become more common under future global environmental change.},

	abstract = {The European native, noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) has suffered from a serious and long term population decline due to habitat destruction, water pollution and the impact of the invasive North American crayfish that are carriers of the crayfish plague (Aphanomyces astaci). The latter being the major factor currently confining noble crayfish to uninvaded (parts of) waterbodies. However, recently wild populations of apparently healthy noble crayfish carrying the crayfish plague have been found. As crayfish are known for their inter- and intraspecific agonistic behaviour which may be key for their competitive success, this raised the interesting question what would happen if the crayfish plague would not be a dominant factor anymore in the interaction between native and invasive species. Since the outcome of those encounters is still unclear, this study explores whether the noble crayfish can stand its ground towards invasive species in such agonistic interactions. Furthermore, the ability of the noble crayfish and invasive crayfish to acquire shelter through agonistic interaction is also assessed. Through pairwise staged interactions, agonistic behaviour and shelter competition between the native A. astacus and the invasive Faxonius limosus and Procambarus acutus were examined. The results showed that A. astacus triumphs over F. limosus and P. acutus in agonistic encounters and in competition for shelter. In turn, P. acutus dominates F. limosus in staged encounters and shelter. In possible future situations were crayfish plague does no longer eradicate noble crayfish populations, our results show that the native noble crayfish might still have a promising future when confronted with invasive species.},

While the availability of high-quality ecological monitoring data is increasing, the quantification of functional diversity so far requires the identification of species traits, for which data are harder to obtain. However, the traits that are relevant for the ecological function of a species also shape its performance in the environment and hence, should be reflected indirectly in its spatiotemporal distribution. Thus, it may be possible to reconstruct these traits from a sufficiently extensive monitoring dataset. Here, we use diffusion maps, a deterministic and de facto parameter-free analysis method, to reconstruct a proxy representation of the species’ traits directly from monitoring data and use it to estimate functional diversity. We demonstrate this approach with both simulated data and real-world phytoplankton monitoring data from the Baltic Sea. We anticipate that wider application of this approach to existing data could greatly advance the analysis of changes in functional biodiversity.},

Using data from long-term mass-marking programs conducted by national hatcheries in Japan, we evaluated the effects of wild genes in the parental generation on the survival of captive-bred populations. Our results indicated that increasing the percentage of wild genes improves survival of captive-bred offspring in the wild in two salmonid species.

	abstract = {Contemporary studies of species coexistence are underpinned by deterministic models that assume that competing species have continuous (i.e., noninteger) densities, live in infinitely large landscapes, and coexist over infinite time horizons. By contrast, in nature, species are composed of discrete individuals subject to demographic stochasticity and occur in habitats of finite size where extinctions occur in finite time. One consequence of these discrepancies is that metrics of species’ coexistence derived from deterministic theory may be unreliable predictors of the duration of species coexistence in nature. These coexistence metrics include invasion growth rates and niche and fitness differences, which are now commonly applied in theoretical and empirical studies of species coexistence. In this study, we tested the efficacy of deterministic coexistence metrics on the duration of species coexistence in a finite world. We introduce new theoretical and computational methods to estimate coexistence times in stochastic counterparts of classic deterministic models of competition. Importantly, we parameterized this model using experimental field data for 90 pairwise combinations of 18 species of annual plants, allowing us to derive biologically informed estimates of coexistence times for a natural system. Strikingly, we found that for species expected to deterministically coexist, community sizes containing only 10 individuals had predicted coexistence times of more than 1000 years. We also found that invasion growth rates explained 60\% of the variation in intrinsic coexistence times, reinforcing their general usefulness in studies of coexistence. However, only by integrating information on both invasion growth rates and species' equilibrium population sizes could most ({\textgreater}99\%) of the variation in species coexistence times be explained. This integration was achieved with demographically uncoupled single-species models solely determined by the invasion growth rates and equilibrium population sizes. Moreover, because of a complex relationship between niche overlap/fitness differences and equilibrium population sizes, increasing niche overlap and increasing fitness differences did not always result in decreasing coexistence times, as deterministic theory would predict. Nevertheless, our results tend to support the informed use of deterministic theory for understanding the duration of species’ coexistence while highlighting the need to incorporate information on species' equilibrium population sizes in addition to invasion growth rates.},

This expectation stems from an explicit assumption of resource scarcity and implicit assumptions of Malthusian struggle and winner-takes-all dynamics. Fidelity to the competitive exclusion principle (CEP) presents species diversity as a paradox: if species compete for limited resources, how can they coexist? In this article, we investigate the contradiction between the theoretical expectation of competitive exclusion and the empirical prevalence of multispecies communities. We trace the persistence of the CEP in ecological research despite numerous challenges and explore publishing trends suggesting that this framework has resulted in a disproportionate focus on competition and exclusion in contemporary research. From a critical science studies perspective, we analyze the sociopolitical factors that have contributed to these patterns. We argue that we must excavate the ideological foundation on which competition-based coexistence research has been built to move beyond the current perceived “diversity paradox.” To that end, we propose shifting the baseline expectation of coexistence research, introducing the notion of a coexistence principle, which positions the persistence of multispecies communities as the rule rather than the exception in nature.},

	abstract = {For community ecologists, “neutral or not?” is a fundamental question, and thus, rejecting neutrality is an important first step before investigating the deterministic processes underlying community dynamics. Hubbell's neutral model is an important contribution to the exploration of community dynamics, both technically and philosophically. However, the neutrality tests for this model are limited by a lack of statistical power, partly because the zero-sum assumption of the model is unrealistic. In this study, we developed a neutrality test for local communities that implements non-zero-sum community dynamics and determines the number of new species (Nsp) between observations. For the non-zero-sum neutrality test, the model distributed the expected Nsp, as calculated by extensive simulations, which allowed us to investigate the neutrality of the observed community by comparing the observed Nsp with distributions of the expected Nsp derived from the simulations. For this comparison, we developed a new “non-zero-sum Nsp test,” which we validated by running multiple neutral simulations using different parameter settings. We found that the non-zero-sum Nsp test rejected neutrality at a near-significance level, which justified the validity of our approach. For an empirical test, the non-zero-sum Nsp test was applied to real tropical tree communities in Panama and Malaysia. The non-zero-sum Nsp test rejected neutrality in both communities when the observation interval was long and Nsp was large. Hence, the non-zero-sum Nsp test is an effective way to examine neutrality and has reasonable statistical power to reject the neutral model, especially when the observed Nsp is large. This unique and simple approach is statistically powerful, even though it only employs two temporal sequences of community data. Thus, this test can be easily applied to existing datasets. In addition, application of the test will provide significant benefits for detecting changing biodiversity under climate change and anthropogenic disturbance.},

The mesopredator release effect occurs when the removal of an apex predator increases the density of a mesopredator, which in turn reduces the density of their shared prey. The mesopredator release effect can pose significant challenges for predator management and biodiversity conservation. Although several mathematical models have proposed specific circumstances that induce the mesopredator release effect, no theory has yet provided general conditions for this effect. Here, we propose a simple mathematical model to clarify the general conditions that induce the mesopredator release effect. The model predicts that the mesopredator release effect will occur when 1) the carrying capacity of the mesopredator exceeds a certain threshold, and 2) the top–down effect of the apex predator is larger on the mesopredator than on their shared prey. These conditions unify those from previous models and match the existing empirical examples. The simplicity of our theory may be useful for developing system-specific guidelines to control the mesopredator release effect in various ecosystems.},

Here, I analysed time-varying interaction networks that were reconstructed using 1197 species, DNA-based ecological time series taken from experimental rice plots and empirical dynamic modelling, and introduced ‘interaction capacity', namely, the sum of interaction strength that a single species gives and receives, as a potential driver of community diversity. As community diversity increases, the number of interactions increases exponentially but the mean interaction capacity of a community becomes saturated, weakening interspecific interactions. These patterns are modelled with simple mathematical equations, based on which I propose the ‘interaction capacity hypothesis': that interaction capacity and network connectance can be two fundamental properties that influence community diversity. Furthermore, I show that total DNA abundance and temperature influence interaction capacity and connectance nonlinearly, explaining a large proportion of diversity patterns observed in various systems. The interaction capacity hypothesis enables mechanistic explanations of community diversity. Therefore, analysing ecological community data from the viewpoint of interaction capacity would provide new insight into community diversity.},

	abstract = {Clustering is a ubiquitous task in ecological and environmental sciences and multiple methods have been developed for this purpose. Because these clustering methods typically require users to a priori specify the number of groups, the standard approach is to run the algorithm for different numbers of groups and then choose the optimal number using a criterion (e.g., AIC or BIC). The problem with this approach is that it can be computationally expensive to run these clustering algorithms multiple times (i.e., for different numbers of groups) and some of these information criteria can lead to an overestimation of the number of groups. To address these concerns, we advocate for the use of sparsity-inducing priors within a Bayesian clustering framework. In particular, we highlight how the truncated stick-breaking (TSB) prior, a prior commonly adopted in Bayesian nonparametrics, can be used to simultaneously determine the number of groups and estimate model parameters for a wide range of Bayesian clustering models without requiring the fitting of multiple models. We illustrate the ability of this prior to successfully recover the true number of groups for three clustering models (two types of mixture models, applied to GPS movement data and species occurrence data, as well as the species archetype model) using simulated data in the context of movement ecology and community ecology. We then apply these models to armadillo movement data in Brazil, plant occurrence data from Alberta (Canada), and bird occurrence data from North America. We believe that many ecological and environmental sciences applications will benefit from Bayesian clustering methods with sparsity-inducing priors given the ubiquity of clustering and the associated challenge of determining the number of groups. Two R packages, EcoCluster and bayesmove, are provided that enable the straightforward fitting of these models with the TSB prior.},

However, contributions of riverine processing are poorly constrained at continental scales. Scaling relationships of cumulative biogeochemical function with watershed size (allometric scaling) provide an approach for quantifying the contributions of fluvial networks in the Earth system. Here we show that allometric scaling of cumulative riverine function with watershed area ranges from linear to superlinear, with scaling exponents constrained by network shape, hydrological conditions, and biogeochemical process rates. Allometric scaling is superlinear for processes that are largely independent of substrate concentration (e.g., gross primary production) due to superlinear scaling of river network surface area with watershed area. Allometric scaling for typically substrate-limited processes (e.g., denitrification) is linear in river networks with high biogeochemical activity or low river discharge but becomes increasingly superlinear under lower biogeochemical activity or high discharge, conditions that are widely prevalent in river networks. The frequent occurrence of superlinear scaling indicates that biogeochemical activity in large rivers contributes disproportionately to the function of river networks in the Earth system.},

	abstract = {Dispersal and dormancy are two common strategies allowing for species persistence and the maintenance of biodiversity in variable environments. However, theory and empirical tests of spatial diversity patterns tend to examine either mechanism in isolation. Here, we developed a stochastic, spatially explicit metacommunity model incorporating seed banks with varying germination and survival rates. We found that dormancy and dispersal had interactive, nonlinear effects on the maintenance and distribution of metacommunity diversity. Seed banks promoted local diversity when seed survival was high and maintained regional diversity through interactions with dispersal. The benefits of seed banks for regional diversity were largest when dispersal was high or intermediate, depending on whether local competition was equal or stabilising. Our study shows that classic predictions for how dispersal affects metacommunity diversity can be strongly influenced by dormancy. Together, these results emphasise the need to consider both temporal and spatial processes when predicting multi-scale patterns of diversity.},

Known as the temperature-size rule (TSR), this pattern is commonly attributed to higher metabolism in warmer waters, leaving fewer resources for growth. An alternative explanation focuses on growth and reproduction trade-offs across temperatures. We tested these hypotheses by measuring growth, maturation, metabolism and reproductive allocation from zebrafish populations kept at 26 and 30°C across six generations. Zebrafish growth and maturation followed TSR expectations but were not explained by baseline metabolic rate, which converged between temperature treatments after a few generations. Rather, we found that females at 30°C allocated more to reproduction, especially when maturing at the smallest sizes. We show that elevated temperatures do not necessarily increase baseline metabolism if sufficient acclimation is allowed and call for an urgent revision of modelling assumptions used to predict population and ecosystem responses to warming.},

To do this, we analysed 5 years of biweekly biomass measures (NDVI) in an experiment manipulating plant species richness and three consumer groups (foliar fungi, soil fungi and arthropods). Positive plant diversity effects on biomass were greatest early in the growing season, whereas the foliar fungicide and insecticide treatments increased biomass most late in the season. Additionally, diverse plots and plots containing foliar fungi reached maximum biomass almost a month earlier than monocultures and plots treated with foliar fungicide, demonstrating the dynamic and interactive roles that biodiversity and consumers play in regulating biomass production through the growing season.},

However, quantitatively disentangling direct and indirect relationships in networks remains a formidable task. Here, we present a framework, called iDIRECT (Inference of Direct and Indirect Relationships with Effective Copula-based Transitivity), for quantitatively inferring direct dependencies in association networks. Using copula-based transitivity, iDIRECT eliminates/ameliorates several challenging mathematical problems, including ill-conditioning, self-looping, and interaction strength overflow. With simulation data as benchmark examples, iDIRECT showed high prediction accuracies. Application of iDIRECT to reconstruct gene regulatory networks in
              Escherichia coli
              also revealed considerably higher prediction power than the best-performing approaches in the DREAM5 (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods project, \#5) Network Inference Challenge. In addition, applying iDIRECT to highly diverse grassland soil microbial communities in response to climate warming showed that the iDIRECT-processed networks were significantly different from the original networks, with considerably fewer nodes, links, and connectivity, but higher relative modularity. Further analysis revealed that the iDIRECT-processed network was more complex under warming than the control and more robust to both random and target species removal (
              P
              {\textless} 0.001). As a general approach, iDIRECT has great advantages for network inference, and it should be widely applicable to infer direct relationships in association networks across diverse disciplines in science and engineering.},

Past work on microbial coexistence has largely focused on species pairs, but it is unclear whether pairwise coexistence in isolation is required for coexistence in a multispecies community. To address this question, we conducted hundreds of pairwise competition experiments among the stably coexisting members of 12 different enrichment communities in vitro. To determine the outcomes of these experiments, we developed an automated image analysis pipeline to quantify species abundances. We found that competitive exclusion was the most common outcome, and it was strongly hierarchical and transitive. Because many species that coexist within a stable multispecies community fail to coexist in pairwise co-culture under identical conditions, we concluded that multispecies coexistence is an emergent phenomenon. This work highlights the importance of community context for understanding the origins of coexistence in complex ecosystems.},

These so-called priority effects have been extensively studied aboveground, but we still do not know how they affect the vertical distribution of roots in the soil and the rooting depth of plant communities. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated the order of arrival of three plant functional groups (forbs, grasses and legumes) in a rhizobox experiment. Priority effects were created by sowing one functional group 10 days before the other two. Rhizoboxes in which all functional groups were sown simultaneously were used as controls. During the experiment, the total visible root length and the mean and maximum rooting depth of plant communities were monitored using image analysis and a new methodological approach using deep learning (RootPainter) for root segmentation. At harvest, we measured aboveground (community and species level) and belowground (community level) biomass, and assessed the vertical distribution of the root biomass in different soil layers. At the community level, all scenarios where one functional group was sown before the other two had similar shoot and root productivity. At the species level, two forbs (Achillea millefolium and Centaurea jacea) benefited from arriving early, and one legume (Trifolium pratense) had a disadvantage when it was sown after the grasses. Priority effect treatments also affected the vertical distribution of roots. When grasses were sown first, plant communities rooted more shallowly (lower mean and maximum rooting depth) than when forbs or legumes were sown first. In addition, roots moved down the soil profile more slowly in grasses-first communities. Our results highlight that plant functional group order of arrival in grassland communities can affect the vertical distribution of roots in the soil and this may have implications for species coexistence.},

We found positive associations with state that suggest these areas are well targeted and that the greatest benefit accrued to the most conservation-dependent species since positive associations with change were largely restricted to rare and declining species and habitat specialists. We suggest that increased productivity provides a plausible demographic mechanism for positive effects of designation.},

To make estimation feasible, our approach focusses on spatial weight matrices which are binary prior to row-standardization. We discuss the use of hierarchical priors which impose sparsity in the spatial weight matrix. Monte Carlo simulations show that these priors perform very well where the number of unknown parameters is large relative to the observations.

Here we show that specific combinations of life history strategy optimize the persistence times of species competing for a single resource before one species overtakes its competitors. This suggests that co-occurring species would tend to have such complementary life history strategies, which we demonstrate using empirical data for perennial plants.},

Classic ecological theory1,2 posits that niches dictate the maximum number of species that can coexist in a community and that the richness of observed species will be below this maximum only where immigration is very low. A new alternative theory3,4 is that niches, instead, dictate the minimum number of coexisting species and that the richness of observed species will usually be well above this because of ongoing immigration. We conducted an experimental test to discriminate between these two unified theories using a manipulative field experiment with tropical intertidal communities. We found, consistent with the new theory, that the relationship of species richness to immigration rate stabilized at a low value at low immigration rates and did not saturate at high immigration rates. Our results suggest that tropical intertidal communities have low niche diversity and are typically in a dispersal-assembled regime where immigration is high enough to overfill the niches. Observational data from other studies3,5 suggest that these conclusions may generalize to other ecological systems. Our new experimental approach can be adapted for other systems and be used as a ‘niche detector’ and a tool for assessing when communities are niche versus dispersal assembled.},

	abstract = {Using geospatial data of wildlife presence to predict a species distribution across a geographic area is among the most common tools in management and conservation. The collection of high-quality presence–absence (PA) data through structured surveys is, however, expensive, and managers usually have access to larger amounts of low-quality presence-only (PO) data collected by citizen scientists, opportunistic observations and culling returns for game species. Integrated species distribution models (ISDMs) have been developed to make the most of the data available by combining the higher-quality, but usually scarcer and more spatially restricted, PA data with the lower-quality, unstructured, but usually more extensive PO datasets. Joint-likelihood ISDMs can be run in a Bayesian context using integrated nested laplace approximation methods that allow the addition of a spatially structured random effect to account for data spatial autocorrelation. Here, we apply this innovative approach to fit ISDMs to empirical data, using PA and PO data for the three prevalent deer species in Ireland: red, fallow and sika deer. We collated all deer data available for the past 15 years and fitted models predicting distribution and relative abundance at a 25 km2 resolution across the island. Model predictions were associated to spatial estimate of uncertainty, allowing us to assess the quality of the model and the effect that data scarcity has on the certainty of predictions. Furthermore, we checked the performance of the three species-specific models using two datasets, independent deer hunting returns and deer densities based on faecal pellet counts. Our work clearly demonstrates the applicability of spatially explicit ISDMs to empirical data in a Bayesian context, providing a blueprint for managers to exploit unexplored and seemingly unusable data that can, when modelled with the proper tools, serve to inform management and conservation policies.},

Here, we develop a spatially explicit theoretical model that provides an integrated framework for understanding variation in food chain length in branching networks. We show independent, positive influences of ecosystem size and complexity (as indicated by branching properties) on food chain length. However, the effects of ecosystem size and complexity were contingent upon other factors, appearing more clearly in high-disturbance and high-productivity regimes.

	abstract = {Predicting the spread of populations across fragmented habitats is vital if we are to manage their persistence in the long term. We applied network theory with a model and an experiment to show that spread rate is jointly defined by the configuration of habitat networks (i.e., the arrangement and length of connections between habitat fragments) and the movement behavior of individuals. We found that population spread rate in the model was well predicted by algebraic connectivity of the habitat network. A multigeneration experiment with the microarthropod Folsomia candida validated this model prediction. The realized habitat connectivity and spread rate were determined by the interaction between dispersal behavior and habitat configuration, such that the network configurations that facilitated the fastest spread changed depending on the shape of the species’ dispersal kernel. Predicting the spread rate of populations in fragmented landscapes requires combining knowledge of species-specific dispersal kernels and the spatial configuration of habitat networks.

Therefore, without rigorously showing that it can outperform traditional species-focused alternatives, its broad-scale adoption in conservation is unlikely. We present a large-scale replicated and controlled set of whole-lake experiments in fish conservation (20 lakes monitored over 6 years with more than 150,000 fish sampled) to examine the outcomes of ecosystem-based habitat enhancement (coarse woody habitat addition and shallow littoral zone creation) versus a widespread, species-focused alternative that has long dominated fisheries management practice (i.e., fish stocking). Adding coarse woody habitats alone did not, on average, enhance fish abundance, but creating shallow water habitat consistently did, especially for juvenile fish. Species-focused fish stocking completely failed. We provide strong evidence questioning the performance of species-focused conservation actions in aquatic ecosystems and instead recommend ecosystem-based management of key habitats.},

	abstract = {Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) and wolves (Canis lupus) are two apex predators with strong and cascading effects on ecosystem structure and function. After decades of recovery from near extirpation, their ranges now overlap, allowing sea otters and wolves to interact for the first time in the scientific record. We intensively studied wolves during 2015 to 2021 in an island system colonized by sea otters in the 2000s and by wolves in 2013. After wolf colonization, we quantified shifts in foraging behavior with DNA metabarcoding of 689 wolf scats and stable isotope analyses, both revealing a dietary switch from Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus), the terrestrial in situ primary prey, to sea otters. Here we show an unexpected result of the reintroduction and restoration of sea otters, which became an abundant marine subsidy for wolves following population recovery. The availability of sea otters allowed wolves to persist and continue to reproduce, subsequently nearly eliminating deer. Genotypes from 390 wolf scats and telemetry data from 13 wolves confirmed island fidelity constituting one of the highest known wolf population densities and upending standardly accepted wolf density predictions based on ungulate abundance. Whereas marine subsidies in other systems are generally derived from lower trophic levels, here an apex nearshore predator became a key prey species and linked nearshore and terrestrial food webs in a recently deglaciated and rapidly changing ecosystem. These results underscore that species restoration may serve as an unanticipated nutrient pathway for recipient ecosystems even resulting in cross-boundary subsidy cascades.},

We paired a 20 y freshwater microbial community time series with zooplankton and phytoplankton counts, rich environmental data, and a 6 y cyanotoxin time series. We observed strong microbial phenological patterns that were disrupted by the invasions of spiny water flea (Bythotrephes cederströmii) and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha). First, we detected shifts in Cyanobacteria phenology. After the spiny water flea invasion, Cyanobacteria dominance crept earlier into clearwater; and after the zebra mussel invasion, Cyanobacteria abundance crept even earlier into the diatom-dominated spring. During summer, the spiny water flea invasion sparked a cascade of shifting diversity where zooplankton diversity decreased and Cyanobacteria diversity increased. Second, we detected shifts in cyanotoxin phenology. After the zebra mussel invasion, microcystin increased in early summer and the duration of toxin production increased by over a month. Third, we observed shifts in heterotrophic bacteria phenology. The Bacteroidota phylum and members of the acI Nanopelagicales lineage were differentially more abundant. The proportion of the bacterial community that changed differed by season; spring and clearwater communities changed most following the spiny water flea invasion that lessened clearwater intensity, while summer communities changed least following the zebra mussel invasion despite the shifts in Cyanobacteria diversity and toxicity. A modeling framework identified the invasions as primary drivers of the observed phenological changes. These long-term invasion-mediated shifts in microbial phenology demonstrate the interconnectedness of microbes with the broader food web and their susceptibility to long-term environmental change.},

Using plankton time series data from 17 lakes and 4 marine sites, we found seasonal patterns of local instability in many species, that short-term predictability was related to local instability, and that local instability occurred most often in the spring, associated with periods of high growth. Taxonomic aggregates were more stable and more predictable than finer groupings. Across sites, higher latitude locations had higher Lyapunov exponents and greater seasonality in local instability, but only at coarser taxonomic resolution. Overall, these results suggest that prediction accuracy, sensitivity to change and management efficacy may be greater at certain times of year and that prediction will be more feasible for taxonomic aggregates.},

	abstract = {Effective conservation of ecological communities requires accurate and up-to-date information about whether species are persisting or declining to extinction. The persistence of an ecological community is supported by its underlying network of species interactions. While the persistence of the network supporting the whole community is the most relevant scale for conservation, in practice, only small subsets of these networks can be monitored. There is therefore an urgent need to establish links between the small snapshots of data conservationists can collect, and the “big picture” conclusions about ecosystem health demanded by policymakers, scientists, and societies. Here, we show that the persistence of small subnetworks (motifs) in isolation—that is, their persistence when considered separately from the larger network of which they are a part—is a reliable probabilistic indicator of the persistence of the network as a whole. Our methods show that it is easier to detect if an ecological community is not persistent than if it is persistent, allowing for rapid detection of extinction risk in endangered systems. Our results also justify the common practice of predicting ecological persistence from incomplete surveys by simulating the population dynamics of sampled subnetworks. Empirically, we show that our theoretical predictions are supported by data on invaded networks in restored and unrestored areas, even in the presence of environmental variability. Our work suggests that coordinated action to aggregate information from incomplete sampling can provide a means to rapidly assess the persistence of entire ecological networks and the expected success of restoration strategies.},

While such contingency of community assembly has been widely appreciated, the empirical and theoretical evidence is scattered around in the literature, and few efforts have been made to synthesize it. In this mini-review, we summarize the accumulated evidence of the context-dependency of community assembly rules, to reach a rough generalization of the contingency. Specifically, we argue that spatial and temporal dimensions can serve as general axes that regulate the relative importance of assembly processes. To this end, we synthesize the current understanding of how the relative importance of multiple assembly processes changes with spatial scales and complexity, and with time in the long and short terms. This review concludes that spatial and temporal dimensions can be common currencies of community assembly rules that are shared across various systems.},

	abstract = {mcbrnet Overview mcbrnet is a collection of functions to perform metacommunity simulation in branching networks. Main functions include: brnet() generates a random branching network with the specified number of patches and probability of branching. The function returns adjacency and distance matrices, hypothetical environmental/disturbance values at each patch, and the number of patches upstream (akin to the watershed area in river networks). mcsim() simulates metacommunity dynamics. This function follows a general framework proposed by Thompson et al. (2020). However, it has several unique features that are detailed in Terui et al (2021). igpsim() simulates three-species meta-food web dynamics with intraguild predation. This function shares many features with mcsim(). Currently under development. ggbrnet() is a wrapper of ggraph functions for easy visualization of a network produced by brnet() . ptsource() is a function to simulate propagation of environmental pollutants in a river network. frgm() is a function to simulate fragmentation in a river network. adjtodist() converts an adjacency matrix to a distance matrix.

	abstract = {The massive release of captive-bred native species (“intentional release”) is a pervasive method to enhance wild populations of commercial and recreational species. However, such external inputs may disrupt the sensitive species interactions that allow competing species to coexist, potentially compromising long-term community stability. Here, we use theory and long-term data of stream fish communities to show that intentional release destabilizes community dynamics with limited demographic benefit to the enhanced species. Our theory predicted that intentional release intensifies interspecific competition, facilitating the competitive exclusion of unenhanced species that otherwise stably coexist. In parallel, the excessive input of captive-bred individuals suppressed the natural recruitment of the enhanced species via intensified within-species competition. Consequently, the ecological community with the intentional release is predicted to show reduced community density with unstable temporal dynamics. Consistent with this prediction, stream fish communities showed greater temporal fluctuations and fewer taxonomic richness in rivers with the intensive release of hatchery salmon—a major fishery resource worldwide. Our findings alarm that the current overreliance on intentional release may accelerate global biodiversity loss with undesired consequences for the provisioning of ecosystem services.},

We find that daily and annual flows are dominated by red and white spectra respectively, and spatial variation in noise color is explained by a combination of geographic, hydroclimatic, and anthropogenic variables. Noise color at the daily scale is influenced by stream network position, and land use and water management explain around one third of the spatial variation in noise color irrespective of the timescale considered. Our results highlight the peculiarities of environmental variation regimes in riverine systems, and reveal a strong human fingerprint on the stochastic patterns of streamflow variation in river networks.},

In Latin America, vampire bats have been culled for decades in hopes of mitigating lethal rabies infections in humans and livestock.

Using Bayesian state-space models, we show that a 2-year, spatially extensive bat cull in an area of exceptional rabies incidence in Peru failed to reduce spillover to livestock, despite reducing bat population density. Viral whole genome sequencing and phylogeographic analyses further demonstrated that culling before virus arrival slowed viral spatial spread, but reactive culling accelerated spread, suggesting that culling-induced changes in bat dispersal promoted viral invasions. Our findings question the core assumptions of density-dependent transmission and localized viral maintenance that underlie culling bats as a rabies prevention strategy and provide an epidemiological and evolutionary framework to understand the outcomes of interventions in complex wildlife disease systems.},

	abstract = {What drives the stability, or instability, of complex ecosystems? This question sits at the heart of community ecology and has motivated a large body of theoretical work exploring how community properties shape ecosystem dynamics. However, the overwhelming majority of current theory assumes that species interactions are instantaneous, meaning that changes in the abundance of one species will lead to immediate changes in the abundances of its partners. In practice, time delays in how species respond to one another are widespread across ecological contexts, yet the impact of these delays on ecosystems remains unclear. Here we derive a new body of theory to comprehensively study the impact of time delays on ecological stability. We find that time delays are important for ecosystem stability. Large delays are typically destabilizing but, surprisingly, short delays can substantially increase community stability. Moreover, in stark contrast to delay-free systems, delays dictate that communities with more abundant species can be less stable than ones with less abundant species. Finally, we show that delays fundamentally shift how species interactions impact ecosystem stability, with communities of mixed interaction types becoming the most stable class of ecosystem. Our work demonstrates that time delays can be critical for the stability of complex ecosystems.},

Consequently, researchers are now confronted with the task of having to choose among a large number of competing hydrologic indices to reduce computational effort and variable redundancy prior to statistical analyses, while still adequately representing the major facets of the flow regime. The present study addresses this concern by providing a comprehensive review of 171 currently available hydrologic indices (including the commonly used Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration) using long-term flow records from 420 sites from across the continental USA. We highlight patterns of redundancy among these hydrologic indices and provide a number of statistically and ecologically based recommendations for the selection of a reduced set of indices that can simultaneously (1) explain a dominant proportion of statistical variation in the complete set of hydrologic indices and (2) minimize multicollinearity while still adequately representing recognized, critical attributes of the flow regime. In addition, we examine the transferability of hydrologic indices across ‘stream types’ by identifying indices that consistently explain dominant patterns of variance across streams in varying climatic and geologic environments. Together, our results provide a framework from which researchers can identify hydrologic indices that adequately characterize flow regimes in a non-redundant manner. In combination with ecological knowledge, this framework can guide researchers in the parsimonious selection of hydrologic indices for future hydroecological studies.

Many of the original plant species living in these ecosystems are adapted to, and function optimally in, soils and solutions with low levels of available nitrogen. The growth and dynamics of herbivore populations, and ultimately those of their predators, also are affected by N. Agriculture, combustion of fossil fuels, and other human activities have altered the global cycle of N substantially, generally increasing both the availability and the mobility of N over large regions of Earth. The mobility of N means that while most deliberate applications of N occur locally, their influence spreads regionally and even globally. Moreover, many of the mobile forms of N themselves have environmental consequences. Although most nitrogen inputs serve human needs such as agricultural production, their environmental consequences are serious and long term. Based on our review of available scientific evidence, we are certain that human alterations of the nitrogen cycle have: approximately doubled the rate of nitrogen input into the terrestrial nitrogen cycle, with these rates still increasing; increased concentrations of the potent greenhouse gas N2O globally, and increased concentrations of other oxides of nitrogen that drive the formation of photochemical smog over large regions of Earth; caused losses of soil nutrients, such as calcium and potassium, that are essential for the long-term maintenance of soil fertility; contributed substantially to the acidification of soils, streams, and lakes in several regions; and greatly increased the transfer of nitrogen through rivers to estuaries and coastal oceans. In addition, based on our review of available scientific evidence we are confident that human alterations of the nitrogen cycle have: increased the quantity of organic carbon stored within terrestrial ecosystems; accelerated losses of biological diversity, especially losses of plants adapted to efficient use of nitrogen, and losses of the animals and microorganisms that depend on them; and caused changes in the composition and functioning of estuarine and nearshore ecosystems, and contributed to long-term declines in coastal marine fisheries.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the characteristics of regression-kriging (RK), its strengths and limitations, and illustrates these with a simple example and three case studies. RK is a spatial interpolation technique that combines a regression of the dependent variable on auxiliary variables (such as land surface parameters, remote sensing imagery and thematic maps) with simple kriging of the regression residuals. It is mathematically equivalent to the interpolation method variously called “Universal Kriging” (UK) and “Kriging with External Drift” (KED), where auxiliary predictors are used directly to solve the kriging weights. The advantage of RK is the ability to extend the method to a broader range of regression techniques and to allow separate interpretation of the two interpolated components. Data processing and interpretation of results are illustrated with three case studies covering the national territory of Croatia. The case studies use land surface parameters derived from combined Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and contour-based digital elevation models and multitemporal-enhanced vegetation indices derived from the MODIS imagery as auxiliary predictors. These are used to improve mapping of two continuous variables (soil organic matter content and mean annual land surface temperature) and one binary variable (presence of yew). In the case of mapping temperature, a physical model is used to estimate values of temperature at unvisited locations and RK is then used to calibrate the model with ground observations. The discussion addresses pragmatic issues: implementation of RK in existing software packages, comparison of RK with alternative interpolation techniques, and practical limitations to using RK. The most serious constraint to wider use of RK is that the analyst must carry out various steps in different software environments, both statistical and GIS.},

	abstract = {Abstract High-resolution data are improving our ability to resolve temporal patterns and controls on river productivity, but we still know little about the emergent patterns of primary production at river-network scales. Here, we estimate daily and annual river-network gross primary production (GPP) by applying characteristic temporal patterns of GPP (i.e., regimes) representing distinct river functional types to simulated river networks. A defined envelope of possible productivity regimes emerges at the network-scale, but the amount and timing of network GPP can vary widely within this range depending on watershed size, productivity in larger rivers, and reach-scale variation in light within headwater streams. Larger rivers become more influential on network-scale GPP as watershed size increases, but small streams with relatively low productivity disproportionately influence network GPP due to their large collective surface area. Our initial predictions of network-scale productivity provide mechanistic understanding of the factors that shape aquatic ecosystem function at broad scales.},

Classical random-effects based solutions include the Poisson-gamma model, which uses the conjugacy between the Poisson and gamma distributions, but which does not model spatial correlation, on the one hand, and the more advanced CAR model, which also introduces a spatial autocorrelation term but without a closed-form posterior distribution on the other. In this paper, a combined model is proposed: an alternative convolution model accounting for both overdispersion and spatial correlation in the data by combining the Poisson-gamma model with a spatially-structured normal CAR random effect. The Limburg Cancer Registry data on kidney and prostate cancer in Limburg were used to compare the conventional and new models. A simulation study confirmed results and interpretations coming from the real datasets. Relative risk maps showed that the combined model provides an intermediate between the non-patterned negative binomial and the sometimes oversmoothed CAR convolution model.},

We know little about the spatial scales relevant for the outcomes of such interactions and little about effect sizes. These knowledge gaps need to be filled to underpin future land management decisions or climate mitigation interventions for protecting and restoring freshwater ecosystems. This study combines data across scales from 33 mesocosm experiments with those from 14 river basins and 22 cross-basin studies in Europe, producing 174 combinations of paired-stressor effects on a biological response variable. Generalized linear models showed that only one of the two stressors had a significant effect in 39\% of the analysed cases, 28\% of the paired-stressor combinations resulted in additive effects and 33\% resulted in interactive (antagonistic, synergistic, opposing or reversal) effects. For lakes, the frequencies of additive and interactive effects were similar for all spatial scales addressed, while for rivers these frequencies increased with scale. Nutrient enrichment was the overriding stressor for lakes, with effects generally exceeding those of secondary stressors. For rivers, the effects of nutrient enrichment were dependent on the specific stressor combination and biological response variable. These results vindicate the traditional focus of lake restoration and management on nutrient stress, while highlighting that river management requires more bespoke management solutions.},

	abstract = {The second largest zone of coastal hypoxia (oxygen-depleted waters) in the world is found on the northern Gulf of Mexico continental shelf adjacent to the outflows of the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers. The combination of high freshwater discharge, wind mixing, regional circulation, and summer warming controls the strength of stratification that goes through a well-defined seasonal cycle. The physical structure of the water column and high nutrient loads that enhance primary production lead to an annual formation of the hypoxic water mass that is dominant from spring through late summer. Paleoindicators in dated sediment cores indicate that hypoxic conditions likely began to appear around the turn of the last century and became more severe since the 1950s as the nitrate flux from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico tripled. Whereas increased nutrients enhance the production of some organisms, others are eliminated from water masses (they either emigrate from the area or die) where the oxygen level falls below 2 mg 1-1 or lower for a prolonged period. A hypoxia-stressed benthos is typified by short-lived, smaller surface deposit-feeding polychaetes and the absence of marine invertebrates such as pericaridean crustaceans, bivalves, gastropods, and ophiuroids. The changes in benthic communities, along with the low dissolved oxygen, result in altered sediment structure and sediment biogeochemical cycles. Important fisheries are variably affected by increased or decreased food supplies, mortality, forced migration, reduction in suitable habitat, increased susceptibility to predation, and disruption of life cycles.},

	abstract = {Emerging theory suggests that the ecosystem-level consequences of anthropogenic pressures depend on how species will be disassembled from ecological communities (i.e. the disassembly rule). Species loss, however, is not the sole ecological cause of ecosystem function loss: behaviours underpinning ecosystem function can also be disrupted by anthropogenic pressures without detectable declines of component species (‘cryptic function loss’). Here, we introduce a novel framework that integrates behavioural responses into community disassembly metrics. We applied this framework to freshwater mussel communities (order Unionida) of the midwestern United States, in which intensive agricultural land use threatens stream biota. We combined a field experiment, meta-analysis and watershed-scale population dataset to assess how excessive sediment concentrations, one of the leading drivers of freshwater biodiversity loss, influence community-level water clearance rates of freshwater mussels via behavioural (changes in mass-specific clearance rate) and population (changes in population density) responses. Our study provided three key insights. First, freshwater mussels exhibited high behavioural sensitivity to increased total suspended solids (TSS) across species (i.e. reduced water clearance rate), whereas population responses were highly species-specific. Second, the behavioural response to increased TSS causes substantial cryptic function loss under stressful conditions: simulated water clearance rates when behavioural response is included can be less than half that of mussel communities with no behavioural response. Finally, simulations revealed that mussel communities are likely to show rapid but consistent rates of ecosystem function loss irrespective of disassembly rules. The similar rates of function loss are due to the uniform behavioural response to TSS that masks the linkage between population sensitivity of a species and its contribution to ecosystem function. Synthesis and applications. Our findings suggest that ignoring behavioural processes may cause non-negligible underestimation of ecosystem function loss during community disassembly, potentially leading to overly optimistic assessments of ecosystem resilience. Furthermore, unlike species declines or local extinctions, behaviour response tied to function loss may occur concurrently with increasing anthropogenic pressures. Therefore, managers should acknowledge the risk of immediate function loss after human-induced environmental changes.},

	abstract = {In the 12 years since Dudgeon et al. (2006) reviewed major pressures on freshwater ecosystems, the biodiversity crisis in the world's lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams and wetlands has deepened. While lakes, reservoirs and rivers cover only 2.3\% of the Earth's surface, these ecosystems host at least 9.5\% of the Earth's described animal species. Furthermore, using the World Wide Fund for Nature's Living Planet Index, freshwater population declines (83\% between 1970 and 2014) continue to outpace contemporaneous declines in marine or terrestrial systems. The Anthropocene has brought multiple new and varied threats that disproportionately impact freshwater systems. We document 12 emerging threats to freshwater biodiversity that are either entirely new since 2006 or have since intensified: (i) changing climates; (ii) e-commerce and invasions; (iii) infectious diseases; (iv) harmful algal blooms; (v) expanding hydropower; (vi) emerging contaminants; (vii) engineered nanomaterials; (viii) microplastic pollution; (ix) light and noise; (x) freshwater salinisation; (xi) declining calcium; and (xii) cumulative stressors. Effects are evidenced for amphibians, fishes, invertebrates, microbes, plants, turtles and waterbirds, with potential for ecosystem-level changes through bottom-up and top-down processes. In our highly uncertain future, the net effects of these threats raise serious concerns for freshwater ecosystems. However, we also highlight opportunities for conservation gains as a result of novel management tools (e.g. environmental flows, environmental DNA) and specific conservation-oriented actions (e.g. dam removal, habitat protection policies, managed relocation of species) that have been met with varying levels of success. Moving forward, we advocate hybrid approaches that manage fresh waters as crucial ecosystems for human life support as well as essential hotspots of biodiversity and ecological function. Efforts to reverse global trends in freshwater degradation now depend on bridging an immense gap between the aspirations of conservation biologists and the accelerating rate of species endangerment.},

	abstract = {▪ AbstractSpatial synchrony refers to coincident changes in the abundance or other time-varying characteristics of geographically disjunct populations. This phenomenon has been documented in the dynamics of species representing a variety of taxa and ecological roles. Synchrony may arise from three primary mechanisms:(a) dispersal among populations, reducing the size of relatively large populations and increasing relatively small ones; (b) congruent dependence of population dynamics on a synchronous exogenous random factor such as temperature or rainfall, a phenomenon known as the “Moran effect”; and (c) trophic interactions with populations of other species that are themselves spatially synchronous or mobile. Identification of the causes of synchrony is often difficult. In addition to intraspecific synchrony, there are many examples of synchrony among populations of different species, the causes of which are similarly complex and difficult to identify. Furthermore, some populations may exhibit complex spatial dynamics such as spiral waves and chaos. Statistical tests based on phase coherence and/or time-lagged spatial correlation are required to characterize these more complex patterns of spatial dynamics fully.},

Research in this area has often been justified on grounds that (1) loss of biological diversity ranks among the most pronounced changes to the global environment and that (2) reductions in diversity, and corresponding changes in species composition, could alter important services that ecosystems provide to humanity (e. g., food production, pest/disease control, water purification). Here we review over two decades of experiments that have examined how species richness of primary producers influences the suite of ecological processes that are controlled by plants and algae in terrestrial, marine, and freshwater ecosystems. Using formal meta-analyses, we assess the balance of evidence for eight fundamental questions and corresponding hypotheses about the functional role of producer diversity in ecosystems. These include questions about how primary producer diversity influences the efficiency of resource use and biomass production in ecosystems, how primary producer diversity influences the transfer and recycling of biomass to other trophic groups in a food web, and the number of species and spatial/temporal scales at which diversity effects are most apparent. After summarizing the balance of evidence and stating our own confidence in the conclusions, we outline several new questions that must now be addressed if this field is going to evolve into a predictive science that can help conserve and manage ecological processes in ecosystems.},

One of the most pervasive signs of intensive fishing is "fishing down the food web", with landings increasingly dominated by smaller species from lower trophic levels. Decreases in the trophic level of landings are assumed to reflect those in fish communities, because size-selective mortality causes decreases in the relative abundance of larger species and in mean body size within species. However, existing analyses of fishing impacts on the trophic level of fish communities have focused on the role of changes in species composition rather than size composition. This will provide a biased assessment of the magnitude of fishing impacts, because fishes feed at different trophic levels as they grow. Here, we combine body size versus trophic level relationships for North Sea fishes (trophic level assessed using nitrogen stable-isotope analysis) with species–size–abundance data from two time-series of trawl-survey data (whole North Sea 1982–2000, central and northern North Sea 1925–1996) to predict long-term trends in the trophic structure of the North Sea fish community. Analyses of the 1982–2000 time-series showed that there was a slow but progressive decline in the trophic level of the demersal community, while there was no trend in the trophic level of the combined pelagic and demersal community. Analyses of the longer time-series suggested that there was no trend in the trophic level of the demersal community. We related temporal changes in trophic level to temporal changes in the slopes of normalised biomass size-spectra (which theoretically represent the trophic structure of the community), mean log2 body mass and mean log2 maximum body mass. While the size-based metrics of community structure showed long-term trends that were consistent with the effects of increased fishery exploitation, these trends were only correlated with trophic level for the demersal community. Our analysis suggests that the effects of fishing on the trophic structure of fish communities can be much more complex than previously assumed. This is a consequence of sampled communities not reflecting all the pathways of energy transfer in a marine ecosystem and of the absence of historical data on temporal and spatial changes in the trophic level of individuals. For the North Sea fish community, changes in size structure due to the differential effects of fishing on species and populations with different life histories are a stronger and more universal indicator of fishing effects than changes in mean trophic level.},

	abstract = {The neutral theory of biodiversity as put forward by Hubbell in his 2001 monograph has received much criticism for its unrealistic simplifying assumptions. These are the assumptions of functional equivalence among different species (neutrality), the assumption of point mutation speciation, and the assumption that resources are continuously saturated, such that constant resource availability implies constant community size (zero-sum assumption). Here we focus on the zero-sum assumption. We present a general theory for calculating the probability of observing a particular species-abundance distribution (sampling formula) and show that zero-sum and non-zero-sum formulations of neutral theory have exactly the same sampling formula when the community is in equilibrium. Moreover, for the non-zero-sum community the sampling formula has this same form, even out of equilibrium. Therefore, the term “zero-sum multinomial (ZSM)” to describe species abundance patterns, as coined by Hubbell [2001. The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ], is not really appropriate, as it also applies to non-zero-sum communities. Instead we propose the term “dispersal-limited multinomial (DLM)”, thus making explicit one of the most important contributions of neutral community theory, the emphasis on dispersal limitation as a dominant factor in determining species abundances.},

	abstract = {The population dynamics of fisheries stock enhancement, and its potential for generating benefits over and above those obtainable from optimal exploitation of wild stocks alone are poorly understood and highly controversial. I review pertinent knowledge of fish population biology, and extend the dynamic pool theory of fishing to stock enhancement by unpacking recruitment, incorporating regulation in the recruited stock, and accounting for biological differences between wild and hatchery fish. I then analyse the dynamics of stock enhancement and its potential role in fisheries management, using the candidate stock of North Sea sole as an example and considering economic as well as biological criteria. Enhancement through release of recruits or advanced juveniles is predicted to increase total yield and stock abundance, but reduce abundance of the naturally recruited stock component through compensatory responses or overfishing. Economic feasibility of enhancement is subject to strong constraints, including trade–offs between the costs of fishing and hatchery releases. Costs of hatchery fish strongly influence optimal policy, which may range from no enhancement at high cost to high levels of stocking and fishing effort at low cost. Release of genetically maladapted fish reduces the effectiveness of enhancement, and is most detrimental overall if fitness of hatchery fish is only moderately compromised. As a temporary measure for the rebuilding of depleted stocks, enhancement cannot substitute for effort limitation, and is advantageous as an auxiliary measure only if the population has been reduced to a very low proportion of its unexploited biomass. Quantitative analysis of population dynamics is central to the responsible use of stock enhancement in fisheries management, and the necessary tools are available.},

In this study, we used a 2X2 design and mark-recapture methods to assess the influences of confluence size ({\textgreater} 0.6, {\textless} 0.6) and upstream land cover (dominantly forested or urban) on reach-scale habitat change, the movement rate of three functional groups of stream fishes, and fish assemblage change at four headwater confluences in a Gulf Coastal Plain drainage in the southeastern United States. We found little evidence to suggest that confluence size contributed to differences in upstream mainstream and downstream mainstem habitat characteristics. Land cover did cause reach-scale, dissimilarities in channel morphology, streamflow, and physical complexity. Therefore, we suggest that physical complexity affected fluvial geomorphic processes and regulated base flow, thus influencing the magnitude of reach-scale habitat change. Accordingly, greater movement by water-column specialists in our urban reaches suggest that land cover indirectly modified this functional group’s ecological response to reach-scale habitat change. Furthermore, our results indicated that the degree of intra-reach, assemblage change was likely a corollary of channel morphology stability. Our understanding of the extent to which land cover alters the geomorphic and ecological gradients associated with headwater confluences will be critical to ensure the conservation of sensitive species whose fitness is dependent on the integrity of these habitats.},

Our three models differ in the order of events, in which the processes of density-dependent prey regulation and predation take place. When their order is reversed, but their relative order remains the same such that only census timing is changed, we observe quantitative differences in population size, but no differences in qualitative behaviour. When a modified order of events induces delayed density dependence, we observe increased stability of population dynamics, which is somewhat contrary to conventional expectation. Overall, our models exhibit behaviour analogous to the Rosenzweig–MacArthur model and highlight the importance of the order of events in discrete-time models.},

Local populations are often reinforced with captive-bred individuals, sometimes including hybrids between the red-legged partridge and the exotic rock partridge (A. graeca). Hunters and wildlife managers oppose releases of hybrids, but their identi®cation by visual inspection is dif®cult beyond the ®rst hybrid generation. Here we report the development of a set of RAPD markers to identify hybrid partridges using blood samples. We initially screened 46 RAPD primers on a subsample of pure red-legged and rock partridges, and ®nally selected six primers that produced 11 markers speci®c of the rock partridge. The selected primers were tested on hybrids of dierent generations bred in captivity. This set of loci permitted the detection of 100\% (n=31) F1 hybrids, 100\% (n=14) backcrosses of F1 to red-legged partridge, all but one (95\%, n=18) hybrid of the second backcross, and 18 out of 27 (67\%, n=27) hybrids of the third backcross. Ecient detection of backcross 1 and 2 individuals is essential, as these are the ones released for re-stocking purposes in hunting states. Although we have only used blood samples, other sources of high-quality DNA, such as muscle, should provide the same results. Therefore, it would be feasible to monitor the genetic purity of partridges in farms and hunting states at dierent stages of production, including embryos, chicks or hunted specimens. \# 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To achieve conservation success, it is essential to accurately assess the demographic parameters and the IUCN Red List criteria of the population. However, acquiring data on all indicators and estimating criteria according to established deﬁnitions can be challenging. Here, we developed an integrated population model (IPM) and population viability analysis (PVA) framework to estimate all demographic parameters and criteria for a reintroduced population of Crested Ibis Nipponia nippon, and to project population dynamics under a range of release scenarios on Sado Island, Japan. Our IPM-PVA framework integrated roost count and mark–resight data for 415 released and 203 wild-hatched individuals, as well as reproductive performance for a total of 575 pairs. We aimed to assess survival, reproductive success, population size, number of mature individuals and population projection. In the ﬁrst year after release, the estimated apparent annual survival rate was 0.566 [Bayesian credible intervals (CRI) 0.518–0.614]; however, this rate increased after 1 year (0.865; CRI 0.836–0.892). Wild-hatched juveniles exhibited a high survival rate (0.757; CRI 0.670–0.838) that was just lower than that of adults (0.899; CRI 0.844–0.949). The reproductive success rate varied with pair attributes (released–released pair: 0.245, CRI 0.194–0.299; released–wild pair: 0.377, CRI 0.281–0.471; wild–wild pair: 0.350, CRI 0.237–0.471). Total population size was estimated to be 457 individuals (CRI 384–525), with 261 mature individuals (CRI 211–304) in June 2021. The probability of Crested Ibis extinction in the next ﬁve generations was 0\%, even if the release was discontinued.

A stomach pump was used to assess the stomach contents. In total, 2,833 aquatic organisms from more than 22 families were found in the stomachs. An index of relative importance (IRI) indicated that chironomid, baetid, and ephemerellid larvae were the major prey for the sculpin. Despite considerable variation in the composition of aquatic organisms among locations, sculpin exhibited strong food selectivity for baetid, glossosomatid, chironomid, and tipulid larvae at multiple locations. Each individual sculpin preyed upon 17.2 prey items on average, and the number of prey items found in the stomach positively correlated with the number of prey families, regardless of sculpin body size. Of 22 prey families found form all stomachs we examined, each individual sculpin preyed upon only 3.54 families on average. These findings suggest that sculpin may have relatively narrow niche breadths regardless of a considerable number of prey individuals in their stomachs. GLM results indicated that a model that incorporated water depth and sculpin body size was the most parsimonious model to explain the prey diversity index in the stomachs of the sculpins. The diversity index of aquatic organisms positively correlated with the mean water depth at each location. These data suggest that rivers with deeper water depths might allow colonization of a variety of aquatic organisms, which might be expected to enhance availability of prey potentially available for the sculpin.},

	abstract = {Worldwide trade in non-native bumblebees remains largely unrestricted despite well-documented cases where introductions of non-native bees have gone dramatically wrong. Within Europe, indiscriminate importation of non-native populations of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) for the pollination of glasshouse crops continues on a massive scale. However, no risk assessment has been conducted for these introductions, perhaps because B. terrestris is considered a native species, so shipping populations from one region to another has been implicitly assumed to present no risk. This view is clearly unjustified because Bombus terrestris populations differ significantly in their genetic makeup as demonstrated by strong differences in coat colour and behavioural traits. Therefore, for the first time we compare an important competitive trait, namely foraging performance, between commercially available B. terrestris populations in contrasting environments. We test whether commercially reared populations differ in their nectar foraging performance and whether this is influenced by both their source environment and the one they are introduced into. We do this by means of a reciprocal transplant experiment. Strong, consistent inter-population differences in performance occurred irrespective of test location: Canary Island bees (B. t. canariensis) were superior to Sardinian bees (B. t. sassaricus), which were generally superior to mainland European bees (B. t. terrestris). These inter-population differences in performance were largely explained by inter-population variation in forager size, with larger bees being superior foragers. However, even when body size was accounted for, “native” bees were not superior to transplanted non-native bees in all but one case. We conclude that non-native populations, especially those with large foragers, can be highly competitive foragers. This could lead to their establishment and displacement of native bees. Therefore, we recommend that unregulated movements of non-native B. terrestris populations within Europe should not be carried out without a full risk assessment.},

	abstract = {We examined latitudinal variation in riverine growth and parr maturation of an endemic Asian salmonid, masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou), in 12 rivers located between 36.6 degrees N and 45.4 degrees N. Masu salmon parr showed considerable variation in growth and maturation patterns among populations. Body sizes were generally larger, and parr maturation was common at southern latitudes. Male parr matured at smaller sizes at more southern latitudes. Latitudinal variation in riverine growth and maturation of masu salmon parr was largely attributed to latitudinal changes in temperature and population density. Parr size at age increased with increasing temperature and decreased with population density. Riverine growth conditions were an important environmental factor determining parr maturation for both males and females; however, the occurrence of mature female parr required extremely favorable growth conditions. Water temperature in May, approximately four months before maturation, was the most important environmental factor affecting the maturation of male parr. Our study supports the hypothesis that freshwater residency was promoted by favorable growth conditions at southern latitudes.},

This study evaluated the effects of hatchery chum salmon fry on sympatric wild masu salmon fry, benthic invertebrate prey, and algae, after a single stocking event in Mamachi stream, Hokkaido, northern Japan. The results suggested that the stocked hatchery chum salmon fry decreased the foraging efficiency and growth of the wild masu salmon fry through interspecific competition, and depressed the abundance of Ephemerellidae and total grazer invertebrates (Glossosomatidae, Heptageniidae, and Baetidae) through predation. Also, the hatchery chum salmon fry may increase algal biomass through depression of grazer abundance by predation (top-down effect). These results suggested that a single release of hatchery chum salmon fry into a stream may influence the recipient stream ecosystem.},

Using microcosms, we tested in five species of the genus Tetrahymena whether dispersal plasticity relates to differences in fitness sensitivity along three environmental gradients. Dispersal plasticity was species-­and environment-­dependent. As expected, dispersal plasticity was generally related to fitness sensitivity, with higher dispersal plasticity when fitness is more affected by environmental gradients. Individuals often preferentially disperse out of low fitness environments, but leaving environments that should yield high fitness was also commonly observed. We provide empirical support for a fundamental, but largely untested, assumption in dispersal theory: the extent of dispersal plasticity correlates with fitness sensitivity to the environment.},

A growing number of empirical studies demonstrate positive diversity-stability relationships. These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both.

We tested these hypotheses using population-­growth models that consider interspecific interactions parameterised for 35 species using field data. We simulated the expected community dynamics under different species-­ interaction scenarios. Interspecific competition was weaker within rather than between clusters, suggesting that differences in unmeasured niche axes stabilise coexistence within clusters. Direct facilitation did not drive clustering. In contrast, indirect facilitation seemingly promoted species alliances in clusters whose members suppressed common competitors in other clusters. Such alliances have been overlooked in the literature on clustering, but may arise easily when within cluster competition is weak.},

Remarkably, random food webs built by preserving just the distribution and correlation of interaction strengths have stability properties similar to those of the corresponding empirical systems. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that the effect of topological network structure on stability, which has been the focus of countless studies, is small compared to that of correlation.

This rule has been tested successfully against 52 heathland small-mammal assemblages. Here it is shown to hold also for 80 forest assemblages of small mammals spanning a latitudinal range from 27°S to 43°S in south-eastern Australia. The observed forest communities are predicted by the rule and they deviate significantly from random assemblages. I suggest that the unique evolutionary history of the Australian fauna has made these patterns more apparent. The rule is simply stated as: ‘There is a much higher probability that each species entering a community will be drawn from a different functional group (genus or other taxonomically related group of species with similar diets) until each group is represented, before the cycle repeats’. A theoretical basis for the rule is proposed which extends the niche compression hypothesis to cover evolutionary time. Evolutionary constraints on adaptations for diet selection are greater than those operating on habitat selection. Successful tests in North America for the granivorous desert rodent guild and the mixed-forest insectivore guild support a wider application of this rule than the Australian communities from which it was derived. A speculative model is proposed in which the mechanisms involved in the operation of this rule shape the evolution of community structure.},

            Streams and rivers form dense networks that drain the terrestrial landscape and are relevant for biodiversity dynamics, ecosystem functioning, and transport and transformation of carbon. Yet, resolving in both space and time gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and net ecosystem production (NEP) at the scale of entire stream networks has been elusive so far. Here, combining Random Forest (RF) with time series of sensor data in 12 reach sites, we predicted annual regimes of GPP, ER, and NEP in 292 individual stream reaches and disclosed properties emerging from the network they form. We further predicted available light and thermal regimes for the entire network and expanded the library of stream metabolism predictors. We found that the annual network-scale metabolism was heterotrophic yet with a clear peak of autotrophy in spring. In agreement with the River Continuum Concept, small headwaters and larger downstream reaches contributed 16\% and 60\%, respectively, to the annual network-scale GPP. Our results suggest that ER rather than GPP drives the metabolic stability at the network scale, which is likely attributable to the buffering function of the streambed for ER, while GPP is more susceptible to flow-induced disturbance and fluctuations in light availability. Furthermore, we found large terrestrial subsidies fueling ER, pointing to an unexpectedly high network-scale level of heterotrophy, otherwise masked by simply considering reach-scale NEP estimations. Our machine learning approach sheds new light on the spatiotemporal dynamics of ecosystem metabolism at the network scale, which is a prerequisite to integrate aquatic and terrestrial carbon cycling at relevant scales.},

	abstract = {Islands or habitat patches in a metapopulation exist as multi-species communities. Community interactions link each species' dynamics so that the colonization of one species may cause the extinction of another. In this way, community interactions may set limits to the invadability of an island and to the likelihood of resident species extinctions upon invasion. To examine the nature of these limits, I assemble stable multi-species Lotka-Vollerra competition communities that differ in resident species number and the average strength (and variance) of species interactions. These are then invaded with species whose properties are drawn from the same distribution as the residents. The invader success rate and the extinction rate of resident species is determined as a function of community-and species-level properties. I show that the probability of colonization success for an invader decreases with species number and the strength and variance of interspecific interactions. Communities comprised of many strongly interacting species limit the invasion possibilities of competing species. Community interactions, even for a superior invading competitor, set up a sort of ‘activation barrier’ that repels the invader. This ‘priority effect’ for residents is not assumed a priori in my description for the individual population dynamics of these species, rather it arises because species-rich and strongly-interacting species sets have alternative stable states that tend to disfavour species at low densities. These models point to community-level rather than invader-level properties as the strongest determinant of differences in invasion success. If an invading species is successful it competitively displaces a greater number of resident species, on average, as community size increases. These results provide a logical framework for an island-biogeographic theory based on species interactions and invasions and for the protection of fragile native species from invading exotics.},

This reflects no apparent relationship between body size and trophic position among prey taxa. Primary consumer taxa (algivores and detritivores) in this system are characterized by diverse size and morphology, and thus predatory fish of all body sizes and feeding strategies are able to exploit taxa feeding low in the food web. Regardless of relative body size, predators exploit short, productive food chains. For any given food chain within a complex web where predators are larger than their prey, trophic position and body size are necessarily correlated. But in diverse food webs characterized by a broad range of primary consumer body size, apparently there is no relationship between trophic position and body size across all taxa in the web.},

	abstract = {Exotic largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) are thought to threaten native aquatic organisms worldwide, but few studies have demonstrated their community-wide impacts, including the interaction between these fish and other exotic organisms. We tested the hypothesis that bass and bluegill in Japanese farm ponds will reduce some native organisms (fish, shrimp, odonates) as well as exotic crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) via top-down effects, whereas other native organisms (chironomid larvae, oligochaetes, and macrophytes) will increase as a result of trophic cascades. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three types of field experiments. In the first experiment, we estimated predation pressure in ponds with and without bass and bluegills by using predator exclusion cages. This experiment revealed that predation on native odonates and exotic crayfish was greater in ponds with bass or bluegills, whereas predation on chironomids, oligochaetes, and macrophytes was lower in ponds with bass or bluegills. In the second experiment, we estimated the impact of bass and bluegills at the community level using four large mesocosms in a pond. Bass or bluegill were introduced into two mesocosms (treatment), but were absent in the other two mesocosms (control). We found that bass reduced native fish, exotic fish, shrimp, odonates, and exotic crayfish, while chironomids, oligochaetes, and macrophytes increased; however, introducing bluegill reduced only shrimp and odonates. In the third experiment, we established small mesocosms with and without exotic crayfish. This experiment showed that crayfish were responsible for a reduction of macrophytes. All three field experiments supported our hypothesis for bass effects, but not for most of the bluegill effects. The results provide important implications for strategies to eradicate exotic fish; when exotic crayfish are present, bass removal is likely to reduce macrophytes that perform important functions in freshwater ecosystems. To conserve macrophytes we propose that reduction of exotic crayfish should be considered when eliminating bass.},

Two Starm. bacillaris strains were individually used in mixed fermentations with a commercial S. cerevisiae. MLF was performed using two autochthonous Lactobacillus plantarum and one commercial Oenococcus oeni inoculated following a simultaneous (together with S. cerevisiae) or sequential (at the end of alcoholic fermentation) approach. The impact of yeast inoculation on the progress of MLF was investigated by monitoring the viable microbial populations and the evolution of the main oenological parameters, as well as the volatile organic composition of the wines obtained in mixed and pure micro-scale winemaking trials. Our results indicated that MLF was stimulated, inhibited, or unaffected in mixed fermentations depending on the strains and on the regime of inoculation. O. oeni was able to perform MLF under all experimental conditions, and it showed a minimal impact on the volatile organic compounds of the wine. L. plantarum was unable to perform MLF in sequential inoculation assays, and strain-depending interactions with Starm. bacillaris were indicated as factor affecting the outcome of MLF. Moreover, uncompleted MLF were related to a lower aromatic complexity of the wines. Our evidences indicate that tailored studies are needed to define the appropriate management of non-Saccharomyces and malolactic starter cultures in order to optimize some technological parameters (i.e. reduction of vinification time) and to improve qualitative features (i.e. primary and secondary metabolites production) of red wines.},

	abstract = {A simple argument based on the distribution of individuals amongst discrete resource sites is used to show how the form of single species population models depends on the type of competition between, and the spatial clustering of, the individuals. For scramble competition between individuals, we confirm earlier demonstrations that the Ricker model is a direct consequence of a uniform random distribution of individuals across resources. By introducing spatial clustering of individuals according to a negative binomial distribution, we are able to derive the Hassell model. Furthermore, the tent map model is seen to be a consequence of scramble competition and an ideal-free distribution of individuals. To model contest competition under different degrees of spatial clustering we derive a new three-parameter model, of which the Beverton–Holt and Skellam models are special cases, where one of the parameters relates directly to the clustering distribution. Other population models, such as the quadratic model and the theta-Ricker models, cannot be derived in our framework. Taken together our derivations of population models allows us to make a more rigorous prescription for model choice when fitting to particular datasets.},

in the U.K. and France, cod in Norway, and Kemp's ridley sea turtle are clear economic failures. No economic data were available for striped mullet in Hawaii or red drum in Texas. Incomplete and conflicting economic data for flounder in Japan provide no clear evidence. Marking was successfully
used in a number of projects to establish that the stocked individuals survived, but it was far more difficult to establish that stocking effected a net increase in population size. Marking should be standard procedure for establishment of survival; control areas should be the method for determination
of net increase in abundance. I suggest that stocking programs be made subject to peer review by scientists without a vested interest in the success of marine enhancement. The economics of stocking should be compared with that of alternatives such as habitat protection, fishery regulation,
and stricter enforcement. Density-dependent processes in the ocean pose difficult obstacles for marine stocking programs, and none of the projects reviewed showed clear evidence of increasing total abundance. It appears that a coalition of vested interests including politicians, users, and
technology advocates has little desire for critical evaluation and that many stocking programs will continue to receive substantial public funds even if shown to be uneconomical.},

	abstract = {Fish biodiversity sustains the resilience and productivity of fisheries, yet this biodiversity can be threatened by overharvest and depletion in mixed-­stock fisheries. Thus, the biodiversity that provides benefits may also make sustainable resource extraction more difficult, a key challenge in fisheries management. We simulated a mixed-­stock fishery to explore relationships between different dimensions of biodiversity and fishery performance relative to conservation and fishery objectives. Different dimensions of biodiversity (number of stocks, evenness, asynchrony among stocks, heterogeneity in stock productivity) exacerbated trade-­offs between fishery and conservation objectives. For example, fisheries targeting stock-­complexes with greater asynchrony, and to a lesser extent richness, had greater stability in harvest through time but also greater risks of overfishing weak stocks and reduced yield compared to less biodiverse stock-­complexes. These trade-­offs were ameliorated by increasing management control—­the capacity of fishery managers to harvest specific stocks. To explore these trade-­offs in real-­world fisheries, we contrasted the fishing and population status of individual stocks within three major mixed-­stock sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka, Salmonidae) fisheries—­Bristol Bay, Fraser River, and Skeena River. In general, the fisheries with lower management control had individual stocks that were more often being over-­or under-­fished, compared with those with higher management control, though variation among regions in biodiversity, scale of management, and magnitude of habitat alteration likely also contribute to these relationships. Collectively, our findings emphasize that there is a need to extract less or regulate better in order to conserve and benefit from biodiversity in fisheries and other natural resource management systems.},

	abstract = {Since their widespread introduction in the 1980s, large-scale tree plantations have seen contestations over their socio-economic impacts. With the establishment of new plantations on the rise, a review of the literature examining their impacts on local communities is needed to inform policies and practices. In this systematic review, we followed an a priori protocol to reduce the selection biases inherent to conventional literature reviews, and considered both grey and peer-reviewed literature. Of the 20,450 studies identified in our literature search, only 92 studies met our predefined inclusion criteria. However, only 22 studies presented a clear comparator and considered confounding factors in their analysis. Of the 251 impacts identified in this sample, most impacts across the nine categories were characterised as predominantly negative impacts attributed to large-scale tree plantations. Impacts on employment (22\% of reported impacts/of which 41\% predominantly negative), land (21\%/81\%), livelihoods (12\%/48\%) and the often intertwined social impacts (20\%/69\%) were the most commonly considered categories, within which a majority of studies agreed on the impact dynamics when in similar contexts, resembling the dynamics observed in other large-scale land-based investments. Most impacts were reported from Southeast Asia (34\% of reported impacts), South America (29\%), Africa (23\%) and Australasia (12\%). We corroborate that costs of large-scale tree plantations for residents tend to be front-loaded, especially when plantations have displaced customary land uses, and possible benefits to accrue over time, moderated by the emergence of local processing and complementary livelihood activities. However, given the methodological inconsistencies in our sample and the under-representation of areas known to have undergone plantation development, strong global evidence on the long-term socio-economic impacts of large-scale tree plantations remains limited.},

The success of efforts to conserve biodiversity thus depends to a large degree on how well scientific knowledge is translated into public policy. Unfortunately, the Endangered Species Act, the United States's strongest legal tool for conserving biodiversity, contains serious biological flaws. The statute itself, as well as agency regulations and policies that implement the law, include provisions that fail to account accurately for important biological concepts such as ecosystem conservation, patch dynamics, and the probabilistic nature of stochastic threats to a species' persistence. Moreover, the procedures of federal agencies charged with implementing the Endangered Species Act in some cases make it difficult for interested outside reviewers to evaluate the agencies' scientific findings and methodology. However, the Endangered Species Act also gives interested individuals and groups several opportunities to provide input into the process of managing threatened and endangered species. Conservation biologists should practice focused advocacy by taking advantage of such opportunities to steer law in a more biologically sound direction.},

	abstract = {We studied the helminth community and body condition of 99 hunter-harvested red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) from Ciudad Real (Central Spain). Forty-six were sampled in two game estates where an important number of farm-reared red-legged partridges are released yearly. The remaining 53 were obtained from natural wild populations adjacent to one of the estates with releases. Four nematode species (Heterakis gallinarum, Aonchoteca caudinflata, Eucoleus contortus and Cheilospirura gruveli) and two cestode species (Raillietina (R.) tetragona and Skryabinia bolivari) were identified. The managed areas showed higher parasite diversity, with higher prevalences and intensities for all helminths found. Three of these species were typical of farm-bred partridges and two of these, A. caundinflata and S. bolivari, were found parasitizing adult partridges. This suggests introduction of these helminths into the breeding population of managed states. The birds sampled in the nonmanaged estates showed a better body condition, but no relation with parasite infection was found. Our results suggest that the release of farm-reared red-legged partridges, a strategy that is becoming a common practice in Spanish hunting areas, poses risk to wild populations because of introducing parasites. However, these results also suggest that simply stopping releases may be a good way to remove locally those parasites from populations, as the establishment of the introduced parasites seems limited.},

	abstract = {We reviewed 180 case studies and a number of theoretical papers on animal relocations published in 12 major international scienti®c journals over the last 20 years. The study focused on re-introductions, supplementations and translocations (sensu IUCN, 1996. IUCN/SSC Guidelines for Re-introductions. 41st Meeting of the IUCN Council, Gland, Switzerland, May 1995. Http://iucn.org/themes/ssc/pubs/policy/hinte.htm.). We did not assess introductions. Re-introductions were the most common type of relocation (116/180); three quarters of these were conducted for conservation purposes. Supplementations (48/180) and translocations (36/180) occurred less frequently, and both were commonly carried out for reasons other than conservation. Simple descriptive statistics were used to analyse factors in¯uencing relocation success. Translocations that aimed to solve human±animal con¯icts generally failed. Re-introduction success was not found to have changed over the last two decades, but re-introductions appeared to be more successful when the source population was wild, a large number of animals was released (n{\textgreater}100), and the cause of original decline was removed. More complex trends were found for the eect of predation and the use of supportive measures such as provision of food or shelter, or predator control prior to release. The success of 47\% of re-introductions was uncertain at the time case studies were published in journals. This was partly due to the lack of generally accepted and widely applied criteria to assess success. Very few case studies (3\%) reported the cost of the relocation attempt. We conclude that there were three primary aims for animal relocations. These were to solve human±animal con¯icts, to restock game populations, and conservation. Our extensive review of the present literature leads us to conclude that the value of animal relocations as a conservation tool could be enhanced through (1) more rigorous testing for the appropriateness of the approach in a given case, (2) the establishment of widely used and generally accepted criteria for judging the success or failure of relocations, (3) better monitoring after a relocation, (4) better ®nancial accountability, and (5) greater eort to publish the results of relocations, even ones that are unsuccessful. \# 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Restoration or establishment of colonies using translocation and hand-rearing can be an effective tool for conserving birds. However, well-designed post-release evaluation studies for long-lived species are rarely implemented. We investigated the attendance and breeding attempts of hand-reared short-tailed albatross (STAL) Phoebastria albatrus chicks (n = 69) translocated to a historic breeding island in the Ogasawara Islands, 350 km from the source colony, for 8 consecutive years after the ﬁrst translocation. Thirty-nine percent of hand-reared birds (n = 27) returned to the translocation site at least once per breeding season, of which 67\% (n = 18) also visited the natal island. The number of hand-reared birds returning each year was lower at the translocation site (mean: 0.3–2.3 birds per day) versus the natal island (0.4–3.5 birds per day). The ﬁrst breeding attempt occurred 5 years after the ﬁrst translocation. Three pairs (producing three chicks) recruited to the translocation site or neighboring islands and ﬁve pairs (producing nine chicks) recruited to the natal island by 8 years after the ﬁrst translocation. Every hand-reared bird that raised a chick paired with a naturally reared bird. At the translocation site and neighboring islands, two hand-reared birds paired with a mate from the natal island and a breeding colony 1850 km away, respectively, while the parents of the third chick were unknown. Their breeding at the translocation region was observed among conspeciﬁc social attractants (decoys, audio playback; one pair) or congeners (two pairs). Our preliminary results suggest that even though more translocated and hand-reared albatrosses visited and recruited to their natal island compared to the translocation site, the early re-establishment of breeding by short-tailed albatrosses in the Ogasawara Islands 80 years after extirpation would not have occurred without the initial translocation effort. Further study is needed, however, to fully understand formation of breeding colonies beyond conspeciﬁc attraction and philopatry.},

In three streams examined, the similarity between the diets of allopatric charr and salmon was much greater than that between the diets of sympatric charr and salmon. Both allopatric charr and sympatric salmon intensively utilized terrestrial invertebrates among stream drifts (52\%–65\% of the diet), whereas this prey category made up only an intermediate portion of sympatric charr diets (11\%–29\%). Examination of available prey composition in stream drifts showed that the consumption of terrestrial invertebrates by allopatric charr and sympatric salmon was approximately twice as much as that by sympatric charr. The presence of salmon, a potential competitor, may alter the diet of charr in the sympatric reaches. Charr holding focal points closer to the streambed were considered less efficient than sympatric salmon in their utilization of terrestrial invertebrates drifting primarily on the stream surface, although the foraging microhabitat of the charr was not influenced by the salmon. The mechanisms responsible for the dietary divergence between sympatric charr and salmon are probably the consequence of scramble competition over terrestrial invertebrates drifting on the stream surface.},

The effects of the two perturbations on dynamics of the Ricker model were similar, but with differences.

At St. Kevin Gulch, an effluent stream in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, subsurface hydraulic gradients and movement of ionic tracers indicated that stream water was locally recharged into well-defined flow paths through the alluvium. Stream water-filled flow paths in the alluvium (referred to as substream flow paths) returned to the stream a short distance downstream (1 to 10 m). Recharge to the substream flow paths occurred where stream water slope increased, at the transition from pools ({\textless}1\%) to steeper channel units (5-20\%). Return of substream flow paths to the stream occurred where stream water slope decreased, at the transition from steeper channel units to pools. A net water flux calculation is typically used to characterize water and solute fluxes between surface and subsurface zones of catchments. Along our study reach at St. Kevin Gulch the net inflow of water from subsurface to stream (1.6 mL s-1 m-1) underestimated the gross inflow (2.7 mL s-1 m-1) by 40\%. The influence of streambed topography is to enhance hydrological fluxes between stream water and subsurface zones and to prolong water-sediment contact times; these effects could have important consequences for solute transport, retention. and transformation in catchments.},

            Tile drainage is one of the dominant agricultural management practices in the United States and has greatly expanded since the late 1990s. It has proven effects on land surface water balance and quantity and quality of streamflow at the local scale. The effect of tile drainage on crop production, hydrology, and the environment on a regional scale is elusive due to lack of high-resolution, spatially-explicit tile drainage area information for the Contiguous United States (CONUS). We developed a 30-m resolution tile drainage map of the most-likely tile-drained area of the CONUS (AgTile-US) from county-level tile drainage census using a geospatial model that uses soil drainage information and topographic slope as inputs. Validation of AgTile-US with 16000 ground truth points indicated 86.03\% accuracy at the CONUS-scale. Over the heavily tile-drained midwestern regions of the U.S., the accuracy ranges from 82.7\% to 93.6\%. These data can be used to study and model the hydrologic and water quality responses of tile drainage and to enhance streamflow forecasting in tile drainage dominant regions.},

	volume = {14},
	abstract = {Temporal changes in a hydrological system and riparian ecosystem were examined with reference to land-use conversion in order to clarify the linkages between these two systems. First, the hydrological system of the Toikanbetsu River basin was divided into three components that measure water retention, inundation and conveyance. Variation in the hydrological system was expressed as a basis of delineating the three components and estimating their functions. The rainfall-runoff system was also examined using a model which can predict responses of surface-, subsurface- and base flows on rainfall intensity. Second, areas and fragmentation of the riparian forests, maximum stream temperature in summer and amount of coarse woody debris (CWD) were selected as parameters indicating the condition of the riparian ecosystem. Temporal changes in stream temperature and amount of CWD were estimated using multiple regression analysis and analysis of variance, respectively. The results indicated that the hydrological system has been altered since the 1970s, increasing flood peaks by 1.5-2.5 times and shortening peak appearance by 7 hours. Riparian forests have been disappearing since the 1960s due to extensive development of agricultural lands and river channelization. The summer maximum stream temperature increased from 22 degrees C in 1947 to 28 degrees C at present. The amount of CWD should substantially decrease with river channelization and associated forest cutting. Fish favoring cool water, such as masu salmon, could survive in 1947 although they are forced to migrate to cooler forested upstream tributaries now. The ecological systems were closely related to and distinctly altered by land-use. Finally, we propose a new perspective for understanding the two interrelated systems. Riparian ecosystems can be restored by restoring water retention and inundation functions, which also reduce the flood hazard generated by elevated flood peaks.},

We monitored all 4 sites before and after wetland construction. Pre-wetland construction, there were few differences in bat activity and community structure at our sites. After wetland construction, we observed greater activity, attributable to all species we recorded, at wetland sites compared to control sites. Species diversity and species richness were also higher at wetland sites compared to control sites. When comparing the same sites before and after wetland construction, both bat activity and species richness increased after construction, but the effects were seen in Winter and not Spring. Our results demonstrate that bats use constructed wetlands in urban ecosystems similarly to other habitat settings.

	abstract = {Bats are known to use aquatic habitats as foraging habitats. Agricultural intensification is perceived to be a main reason for the loss of wetlands. However, artificial wetland creation (i.e. the construction of retention-ponds) in the agricultural landscape aiming at water or nutrient retention has recently gained importance. We evaluated to what extent bats use these artificial wetlands as foraging habitats in an agricultural landscape. Bat activity and prey density were compared in matched pairs at retention-ponds and neighbouring vineyard sites using stationary bat-detectors and sticky-traps, respectively. To examine if bat activity is related to the number of bat individuals, a thermal infrared imaging camera was used. Pipistrellus pipistrellus, the dominant species, served as an example to assess habitat selection between retention-ponds and vineyards. This was performed by relating foraging activity to the available area available within the potential home-range. Total bat activity and nocturnal prey density were significantly higher above the retention-ponds than above vineyards. High differences of activity levels between the ponds and the respective vineyard sites were found for Pipistrellus spp. (P. pipistrellus and P. nathusii) and Myotis spp. (M. daubentonii and M. mystacinus), being about 180 times and 50 times higher above the retention-ponds, respectively. A significant correlation was found between recorded bat activity and the maximum number of bat individuals observed with a thermal infrared imaging camera. When relating foraging activity to habitat availability within the assumed home-range of P. pipistrellus, retention-ponds had on average a higher importance as a foraging habitat than the complete vineyard area although they covered less than 0.1\% of its area. This study indicates that artificial wetlands such as retention-ponds provide foraging habitats for bats. Therefore, creation of wetlands in intensively used agricultural landscapes benefits bats.
Zusammenfassung
Fledermäuse nutzen Gewässer als Nahrungshabitate. Die landwirtschaftliche Intensivierung wird als Hauptgrund für den Verlust an Gewässern angesehen. In dieser Studie wurde untersucht, welche Bedeutung künstlich angelegte Gewässer zum Zweck der Regen- oder Nährstoffrückhaltung in landwirtschaftlichen Flächen als Nahrungshabitate für Fledermäuse haben. Mit Hilfe von stationären Fledermausdetektoren und Klebefallen wurden sowohl die Fledermausaktivität als auch die Nahrungsdichten der entsprechenden Beuteinsekten parallel an Regenrückhaltebecken und in nahe gelegenen Weinbergen gemessen. Mit Hilfe einer Wärmebildkamera wurde untersucht ob es einen Zusammenhang zwischen Fledermausaktivität und Individuenanzahl gibt. Um die Bedeutung beider Habitattypen als Nahrungshabitat abzuschätzen, wurde am Beispiel von Pipistrellus pipistrellus die gemessene Jagdaktivität auf die Flächenanteile beider Habitate innerhalb des Aktionsradius dieser Art bezogen. Die Fledermausaktivität und die Dichten nachtaktiver Insekten waren über den Regenrückhaltebecken signifikant höher. Besonders große Unterschiede an Fledermausaktivität wurden für Pipistrellus spp. (P. pipistrellus und P. nathusii) und Myotis spp. (M. daubentonii und M. mystacinus) nachgewiesen, die im Vergleich zu den Weinbergen 180 beziehungsweise 50-mal höher war. Weiterhin wurde eine Korrelation zwischen registrierter Fledermausaktivität und der maximalen Zahl beobachteter Fledermäuse nachgewiesen. Bezieht man die Jagdaktivität auf die Flächenanteile der beiden untersuchten Habitattypen innerhalb des Aktionsradius von P. pipistrellus so zeigt sich, dass die Regenrückhaltebecken im Mittel eine höhere Bedeutung als der gesamte Weinbergbereich haben, obwohl sie weniger als 0.1\% von dessen Fläche ausmachen. Künstlich angelegte Gewässer wie z.B. Regenrückhaltebecken stellen wichtige Nahrungshabitate für Fledermäuse dar. Neben dem Nutzen des Wasser- und Nährstoffrückhalts profitieren auch Fledermäuse durch die Anlage von Regenrückhaltebecken in landwirtschaftlich geprägten Gebieten.},

RCM simulations of the historical period indicate a large positive bias in growing season length, but generally good agreement with observationally derived estimates of metrics such as the mean summertime maximum and apparent temperatures and number of cooling degree days. There is a tendency towards intensification of thermal extremes by 2041–2062 that is equal to or exceeds the bias in the ensemble mean during the historical period (1979–2000). For example, the number of days in the Chicago region each year with temperatures in excess of 32.2°C (90°F) is doubled by the mid-century. The ensemble average estimates for 1979–2000 from the RCMs is negatively biased in terms of annual, spring and summer precipitation (the wettest pentad) and mean dry day duration, but is positively biased in terms of total precipitation accumulated on the 10 wettest days of the year. The RCM simulations indicate an increased likelihood of extreme hydroclimate events that again are equal to or exceed the historical biases. For example, the wettest pentad and total accumulation on the top 10 wettest days of the year are projected to increase by {\textasciitilde}10\%. Preliminary results for icing and extreme wind events indicate no change in the magnitude of extreme wind events, and perhaps slight reductions in icing risk.},

The most recent influence on nutrient loading—intense and widespread farming and especially fertilizer use—has had a more significant effect on water quality than has land drainage or the conversion of native vegetation to cropland and grazing pastures. The 200-year record of nutrient loading to offshore water is reflected in the paleoreconstructed record of plankton in dated sediments. This record illustrates that the development of fair, sustained management of inland ecosystems is linked to the management of offshore systems. Land use in this fully occupied watershed is under the strong influence of national policies affecting all aspects of the human ecosphere. These policies can be modified for better or worse, but water quality will probably change only gradually because of the strong buffering capacity of the soil ecosystem.},

	title = {Manuresheds: {Advancing} nutrient recycling in {US} agriculture},
	abstract = {Nutrient recycling is fundamental to sustainable agricultural systems, but few mechanisms exist to ensure that surplus manure nutrients from animal feeding operations are transported for use on nutrient-deficient croplands. As a result, manure nutrients concentrate in locations where they can threaten environmental health and devalue manure as a fertilizer resource. This study advances the concept of the “manureshed” – the lands surrounding animal feeding operations onto which manure nutrients can be redistributed to meet environmental, production, and economic goals. Manuresheds can be managed at multiple scales, for example, on farms with both animals and crops, among animal farms and crop farms within a county, or even among animal farms and crop farms in distant counties. With a focus on redistribution among counties, we classified the 3109 counties of the contiguous United States by their capacity to either supply manure phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) from confined livestock production (“sources”) or to assimilate and remove excess P and N via crops (“sinks”). Manure nutrient source counties were identified in 40 of the 48 states, with a substantial concentration in the southern US. Source counties for manure P greatly outnumbered source counties for manure N (390 vs. 100), and 99 of the 100 manure N source counties were also source counties for manure P. Conversely, sink counties for manure N outnumbered sink counties for manure P (2766 vs. 2317). We used the P balances of the source and sink counties to delineate four manuresheds dominated by various combinations of confined hog, poultry, dairy, and beef industries. The four manuresheds differed in the transport distances needed to assimilate excess manure P from their respective source areas (from 147 ± 51 km for a beef dominated manureshed to 368 ± 140 km for a poultry dominated manureshed), highlighting the need for systems-level strategies to promote manure nutrient recycling that operate across local, county, regional, and national scales.},

Various characteristics of FD make it preferable to other measures of functional diversity, such as the number of functional groups in a community. Simulating species' trait values illustrates how the relative importance of richness and composition for FD depends on the effective dimensionality of the trait space in which species separate. Fewer dimensions increase the importance of community composition and functional redundancy. More dimensions increase the importance of species richness and decreases functional redundancy. Clumping of species in trait space increases the relative importance of community composition. Five natural communities show remarkably similar relationships between FD and species richness.},

	abstract = {A prevailing paradigm suggests that species richness increases with area in a decelerating way. This ubiquitous power law scaling, the species–area relationship, has formed the foundation of many conservation strategies. In spatially complex ecosystems, however, the area may not be the sole dimension to scale biodiversity patterns because the scale-invariant complexity of fractal ecosystem structure may drive ecological dynamics in space. Here, we use theory and analysis of extensive fish community data from two distinct geographic regions to show that riverine biodiversity follows a robust scaling law along the two orthogonal dimensions of ecosystem size and complexity (i.e., the dual scaling law). In river networks, the recurrent merging of various tributaries forms fractal branching systems, where the prevalence of branching (ecosystem complexity) represents a macroscale control of the ecosystem’s habitat heterogeneity. In the meantime, ecosystem size dictates metacommunity size and total habitat diversity, two factors regulating biodiversity in nature. Our theory predicted that, regardless of simulated species’ traits, larger and more branched “complex” networks support greater species richness due to increased space and environmental heterogeneity. The relationships were linear on logarithmic axes, indicating power law scaling by ecosystem size and complexity. In support of this theoretical prediction, the power laws have consistently emerged in riverine fish communities across the study regions (Hokkaido Island in Japan and the midwestern United States) despite hosting different fauna with distinct evolutionary histories. The emergence of dual scaling law may be a pervasive property of branching networks with important implications for biodiversity conservation.},

The covariance matrix of the SLMs use distance metrics and geostatistical models that are unique to stream networks; these models account for the distances and topological configuration of stream networks, including the volume and direction of flowing water. In addition, traditional models that use Euclidean distance and simple random effects are included, along with Poisson and binomial families, for a generalized linear mixed model framework. Plotting and diagnostic functions are provided. Prediction (kriging) can be performed for missing data or for a separate set of unobserved locations, or block prediction (block kriging) can be used over sets of stream segments.

Following brief background information, the main focus is on developments in the last five years. Correlative SDMs have become the most commonly used approach for analysing potential climate change impacts on areas suitable for particular species. The use of SDMs has been criticized, but responses to these criticisms are provided and limitations may not be as great as has been suggested. For many species SDMs are the only potential source of data for learning about likely climate change impacts, and suitable occurrence data for SDM analyses exist for about 50 000 tree species. SDM papers have already been published presenting analyses for more than 1000 tree species under projected climate change. Most SDM climate change analyses adopt an ‘equilibrium assumption’ that tree species natural distributions provide a reliable estimate of their climatic requirements. However, in addition to natural distribution data, data from trials outside their natural distributions are desirable to determine their intrinsic climatic adaptability. Progress is described in relation to climatic data, soil data, species distribution data, species and provenance trial data, descriptions of species climatic requirements, mapping of suitable areas and integration of species and environmental data. Desirable future objectives are identified for each of these topics.},

	abstract = {The role of winged aquatic insects that emerge from streams and subsidize terrestrial ecosystems has been demonstrated for natural forest landscapes, but almost no information is available for intensive agricultural landscapes. This study is the first to estimate aquatic subsidies provided by flying insects that emerge from streams and land on cropland. We investigated three major groups of aquatic insects - Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera and Chironomidae (Diptera) - that emerged from 12 third-order temperate, agricultural streams. We simultaneously monitored their emergence using floating traps and their terrestrial dispersal using passive interception traps. We estimated that the annual aquatic emerging dry mass (DM) of these groups varied from 1.4–7.5 g m−2 yr−1, depending on the stream. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate parameters of the terrestrial dispersal function of each group. We combined emerging DM and the dispersal parameters to estimate how terrestrial deposition of aquatic insect DM varied with increasing distance from streams. The results highlighted that emerging DM and dispersal to land could be higher in intensive agricultural landscapes than that previously described in natural settings. We estimated that 12.5 kg ha−1 yr−1 of winged aquatic insect DM fell to the ground 0–10 m from stream edges, composed mainly of Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera. We also estimated that 2.2 kg DM ha−1 yr−1 fell 10–50 m from the stream, especially small-bodied species of Chironomidae, throughout the year, except for the coldest weeks of winter. By influencing aquatic insect communities that emerge from streams, intensive agricultural practices change the magnitude and spatial extent of aquatic subsidy deposition on land. Implications for terrestrial food webs and ecosystem services provided to agriculture are discussed.},

	abstract = {Biotic interactions are fundamental drivers governing biodiversity locally, yet their effects on geographical variation in community composition (i.e. incidence-based) and community structure (i.e. abundance-based) at regional scales remain controversial. Ecologists have only recently started to integrate different types of biotic interactions into community assembly in a spatial context, a theme that merits further empirical quantification. Here, we applied partial correlation networks to infer the strength of spatial dependencies between pairs of organismal groups and mapped the imprints of biotic interactions on the assembly of pond metacommunities. To do this, we used a comprehensive empirical dataset from Mediterranean landscapes and adopted the perspective that community assembly is best represented as a network of interacting organismal groups. Our results revealed that the co-variation among the beta diversities of multiple organismal groups is primarily driven by biotic interactions and, to a lesser extent, by the abiotic environment. These results suggest that ignoring biotic interactions may undermine our understanding of assembly mechanisms in spatially extensive areas and decrease the accuracy and performance of predictive models. We further found strong spatial dependencies in our analyses which can be interpreted as functional relationships among several pairs of organismal groups (e.g. macrophytes–macroinvertebrates, fish–zooplankton). Perhaps more importantly, our results support the notion that biotic interactions make crucial contributions to the species sorting paradigm of metacommunity theory and raise the question of whether these biologically-driven signals have been equally underappreciated in other aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Although more research is still required to empirically capture the importance of biotic interactions across ecosystems and at different spatial resolutions and extents, our findings may allow decision makers to better foresee the main consequences of human-driven impacts on inland waters, particularly those associated with the addition or removal of key species.},

	abstract = {Land-use intensification can increase provisioning ecosystem services, such as food and timber production, but it also drives changes in ecosystem functioning and biodiversity loss, which may ultimately compromise human wellbeing. To understand how changes in land-use intensity affect the relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and services, we built networks from correlations between the species richness of 16 trophic groups, 10 ecosystem functions, and 15 ecosystem services. We evaluated how the properties of these networks varied across land-use intensity gradients for 150 forests and 150 grasslands. Land-use intensity significantly affected network structure in both habitats. Changes in connectance were larger in forests, while changes in modularity and evenness were more evident in grasslands. Our results show that increasing land-use intensity leads to more homogeneous networks with less integration within modules in both habitats, driven by the belowground compartment in grasslands, while forest responses to land management were more complex. Land-use intensity strongly altered hub identity and module composition in both habitats, showing that the positive correlations of provisioning services with biodiversity and ecosystem functions found at low land-use intensity levels, decline at higher intensity levels. Our approach provides a comprehensive view of the relationships between multiple components of biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and ecosystem services and how they respond to land use. This can be used to identify overall changes in the ecosystem, to derive mechanistic hypotheses, and it can be readily applied to further global change drivers.},

The approach allows us to quantify the species’ effective couplings: Their frequencies exhibit a peak at zero and the minimal pairwise model is able to capture about 80\% of the ecosystem structure. Our analysis reveals a relatively stronger impact of the species network on uncommon species and underscores the importance of species pairs experiencing positive couplings. Additionally, we study the associations among species and, interestingly, find that the frequencies of groups of different species, which the approach is able to capture, exhibit a power-law-like distribution.},

At three study areas established along the stream course, the majority of marked sculpins were recaptured in their original location over one or more years, indicating their long-term occupation of each restricted habitat area. Sculpin densities increased toward the upstream habitats, whereas individual growth rates were more rapid downstream. In both sexes, sculpins distributed downstream matured at a larger body size and later in life than upstream sculpins, clearly demonstrating a clinal variation in these respects. A comparison of life-history variations in C. nozawae with those in amphidromous C. hangiongensis suggests that intrapopulational life-history variations in the former might be environmentally induced, and that one of the most important determinants for the variations in Cottus species might be population density.},

The gain in efficiency is achieved by the joint conjugacy property of the proposed prior, which allows block updating of the loadings matrix. We propose an adaptive Gibbs sampler for automatically truncating the infinite loading matrix through selection of the number of important factors. Theoretical results are provided on the support of the prior and truncation approximation bounds. A fast algorithm is proposed to produce approximate Bayes estimates. Latent factor regression methods are developed for prediction and variable selection in applications with high-dimensional correlated predictors.

	abstract = {Spatial structures of ecological communities may originate either from the dependence of community structure on environmental variables or/and from community-based processes. In order to assess the importance of these two sources, spatial relationships must be explicitly introduced into statistical models. Recently, a new approach called principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) has been proposed to create spatial predictors that can be easily incorporated into regression or canonical analysis models, providing a flexible tool especially when contrasted to the family of autoregressive models and trend surface analysis, which are of common use in ecological and geographical analysis. In this paper, we explore the theory of the PCNM approach and demonstrate how it is linked to spatial autocorrelation structure functions. The method basically consists of diagonalizing a spatial weighting matrix, then extracting the eigenvectors that maximize the Moran's index of autocorrelation. These eigenvectors can then be used directly as explanatory variables in regression or canonical models. We propose improvements and extensions of the original method, and illustrate them with examples that will help ecologists choose the variant that will better suit their needs.},

	abstract = {Recruitment often varies substantially in ﬁsh populations, and residual variability may have serial autocorrelation due to environmental effects even after accounting for a stock–recruitment relationship. However, the likely magnitude of variability and autocorrelation in recruitment has yet to be formally estimated. We therefore developed a hierarchical model for recruitment variability and autocorrelation and applied it to data for 154 ﬁsh populations. Results were similar when using either the Ricker or Beverton–Holt stock–recruitment model, and showed that autocorrelated recruitment has a marginal standard deviation of 0.74 (SD = 0.35) and a mean autocorrelation of 0.43 (SD = 0.28) when predicting for an unobserved taxonomic order. Estimates differed somewhat among taxonomic orders and stocks, and also supported a hypothesized positive relationship between age at maturity and autocorrelation in recruitment. Our results can be used as a Bayesian prior for recruitment variability in models for data-poor stocks and to distinguish recruitment from other process errors in models for data-rich stocks. Estimates can also be used in the design of future simulation models and management strategy evaluations and in theoretical research regarding life history variation.},

We used species‐level abundance data from 62 plant communities across five continents to assess mechanisms of temporal stability across spatial scales. We assessed how asynchrony (i.e. different units responding dissimilarly through time) of species and local communities stabilised metacommunity ecosystem function. Asynchrony of species increased stability of local communities, and asynchrony among local communities enhanced metacommunity stability by a wide range of magnitudes (1–315\%); this range was positively correlated with the size of the metacommunity. Additionally, asynchronous responses among local communities were linked with species’ populations fluctuating asynchronously across space, perhaps stemming from physical and/or competitive differences among local communities. Accordingly, we suggest spatial heterogeneity should be a major focus for maintaining the stability of ecosystem services at larger spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Although {\textgreater}70 dams have been decommissioned in Wisconsin over the past 30 y, little is known about the physical and ecological effects of dam removal on riverine ecosystems. The purpose of our study was to document changes in channel form and macroinvertebrate assemblages following the removal of a low-head, run-of-river dam from the Baraboo River, Wisconsin, in January 2000. We surveyed cross sections and collected benthic macroinvertebrate samples in 6 reaches (an upstream reference reach, reaches immediately above and below the dam that was to be removed, and sequential unimpounded and impounded reaches further downstream) in a multiple-dam system. Surveys were conducted in December 1999, before dam removal, in March 2000 immediately after dam removal, and in August 2000 following a flood. Benthic sediments were collected from selected sites in March and August to measure particle size shifts associated with the dam breach. Before dam removal, impounded reaches were characterized by relatively deep, wide channels, extensive deposits of loose sediments, and macroinvertebrate taxa characteristic of lentic or depositional habitats. Removal of the dam significantly decreased the cross-sectional area of the active channel in the former impoundment from 59 m$^{\textrm{2}}$ to 11 m$^{\textrm{2}}$, but did not alter channel form in downstream reaches. However, we found an increase in loose sediments and in the relative abundance of the sand fraction (0.5-2.0 mm) below the dam immediately after it had been removed. A flood in June increased cross-sectional area in the former impoundment by widening the channel. Sediments that had settled in the reaches below the dam in March were transported ∼3.5 km downstream, where they became trapped in another impoundment. The flood had little or no detectable effect on the other 5 study reaches. Within 1 y of dam removal, macroinvertebrate assemblages in formerly impounded reaches did not significantly differ from those in either the upstream reference site or in other unimpounded reaches below the dam site. All unimpounded sites were characterized by lotic taxa such as net-spinning caddisflies and heptageniid mayflies regardless of their impoundment history. Thus, dam removal caused relatively small and transient geomorphic and ecological changes in downstream reaches, and apparently rapid channel development to an equilibrium form within the impoundment, associated with both dam removal and the subsequent June flood. These muted changes and rapid recovery likely result from the relatively large channel size and the small volume of stored sediment available for transport following dam removal.},

However, less is known about the factors triggering the cascading biotic interactions across coupled ecosystems. Here, we quantify how riverine productivity (donor system) mediates terrestrial food web interactions through spatial subsidies to simplified gravel bar communities. Our comparative study in Japan indicated that higher algal biomass in aquatic systems led to increased supplies of emerging aquatic insects, which were associated with greater densities of terrestrial consumers (Carabid beetles) and enhanced consumption rates of supplemental in situ prey on gravel bars. Our results highlight the potential of donor productivity to drive cascading biotic interactions across coupled ecosystems. Because cross-system energy flows should originate, at least in part, from primary producers of donor systems, our fundamental finding may form the basis of future studies exploring the driving factors of cross-system trophic interactions.},

Predator–prey interactions could speed up species range shifts through enemy release or create lags through biotic resistance. Here, we developed a spatially explicit model of interacting species, each with a thermal niche and embedded in a size-structured food–web across a temperature gradient that was then exposed to warming. We also created counterfactual single species models to contrast and highlight the effect of trophic interactions on range shifts. We found that dynamic trophic interactions hampered species range shifts across 450 simulated food–webs with up to 200 species each over 200 years of warming. All species experiencing dynamic trophic interactions shifted more slowly than single-species models would predict. In addition, the trailing edges of larger bodied species ranges shifted especially slowly because of ecological subsidies from small shifting prey. Trophic interactions also reduced the numbers of locally novel species, novel interactions and productive species, thus maintaining historical community compositions for longer. Current forecasts ignoring dynamic food–web interactions and allometry may overestimate species' tendency to track climate change.},

From a methodological point of view, this biological objective calls for a method linking three data matrix tables: a table L with abundance or presence-absence values for species at a series of sites, a table R with variables describing the environmental conditions of the sites, and a table Q containing traits (e. g., morphological or behavioral attributes) of the species. Ten years ago, the fourth-corner method was proposed to measure and test the relationships between species traits and environmental variables using tables R, L, and Q simultaneously. In practice, this method is rarely used. The major reasons for this lack of interest are the restriction of the original method and program to presence-absence data in L and to the analysis of a single trait and a single environmental variable at a time. Moreover, ecologists often have problems in choosing a permutation model among the four originally proposed. In this paper, we revisit the fourth-corner method and propose improvements to the original approach. First, we present an extension to measure the link between species traits and environmental variables when the ecological community is described by abundance data. A new multivariate fourth-corner statistic is also proposed. Then, using numerical simulations, we discuss and evaluate the existing testing procedures. A new two-step testing procedure is presented. We hope that these elements will help ecologists use the best possible methodology to analyze this type of ecological problem.},

Evidence suggests that community assembly often leads to a single stable equilibrium, such that the conditions of the environment and interspecific interactions determine which species will exist there. In such cases, regions of local communities with similar environmental conditions should have similar community composition. Other evidence suggests that community assembly can lead to multiple stable equilibria. Thus, the resulting community depends on the assembly history, even when all species have access to the community. In these cases, a region of local communities with similar environmental conditions can be very dissimilar in their community composition. Both regional and local factors should determine the patterns by which communities assemble, and the resultant degree of similarity or dissimilarity among localities with similar environments. A single equilibrium in more likely to be realized in systems with small regional species pools, high rates of connectance, low productivity and high disturbance. Multiple stable equilibria are more likely in systems with large regional species pools, low rates of connectance, high productivity and low disturbance. I illustrate preliminary evidence for these predictions from an observational study of small pond communities, and show important effects on community similarity, as well as on local and regional species richness.},

Rarely considered in understanding size–diversity relationships is the history of community assembly. I conducted a laboratory microcosm experiment with freshwater protists and rotifers to test for interactive effects of assembly history and ecosystem size on species diversity. The experiment used a two-way factorial design with four assembly sequences and four ecosystem sizes as treatments. Community dynamics were monitored for about 50–100 generations. The results show that history affected diversity more strongly in smaller ecosystems, presumably owing to greater priority effects. Consequently, history determined when diversity was significantly related to ecosystem size. The results also suggest that long-term transient community dynamics can make assembly history important for community structuring even in the absence of alternative stable states. Because species immigration is essentially stochastic, ecosystem size is variable, and priority effects can be strong in many natural systems, the history × size interaction revealed in this study also has the potential to shape natural size–diversity patterns.},

              et al
              . extended this concept to genes, showing that a single allele of a particular plant defense gene facilitates species coexistence across a small experimental trophic system (see the Perspective by Nosil and Gompert). Specifically, plants with this allele grew faster, supporting larger populations of two species of herbivores and their predators. This finding suggests that genotype variation can play a role in the structure and function of organismal systems. —SNV

Capitalizing on this spectacular bioinvasion, we used stable isotope analysis to depict the novel fish food web occurring in the Eastern Mediterranean, off the Lebanese coast. Multivariate analyses were performed on six trophic groups contrasting the δ15N–δ13C ratios of native (MED) versus non-indigenous (Lessepsian-LES) species. Community-wide aspects of trophic structure were explored by means of recently developed quantitative metrics, such as the average distance to centroid and the standard ellipse area. Although the trophic positions of Lessepsian and native species were comparable, native fishes generally showed a greater trophic diversity than Lessepsians, the latter being mainly located in the central region of the available trophic space. We argue that the original trophic niche of native species has widened out due to the shift they have made towards less preferred food items, whilst highly competitive invaders are exploiting more energetic resources. In the absence of historical data, our observations agree with the idea of a rapid change of the Eastern Mediterranean food web, driven by niche displacements through trophic competition.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Freshwater fish are highly threatened by dams that disrupt the longitudinal connectivity of rivers and may consequently impede fish movements to feeding and spawning grounds. In a comprehensive global analysis covering ∼10,000 freshwater fish species and ∼40,000 existing large dams we identified the most disconnected geographical ranges for species in the United States, Europe, South Africa, India, and China. The completion of near-future plans for ∼3,700 large hydropower dams will greatly increase habitat fragmentation in (sub)tropical river basins, where many livelihoods depend on inland fisheries. Our assessment can support infrastructure planning on multiple scales and assist in setting conservation priorities for species and basins at risk.
          , 
            Dams contribute to water security, energy supply, and flood protection but also fragment habitats of freshwater species. Yet, a global species-level assessment of dam-induced fragmentation is lacking. Here, we assessed the degree of fragmentation of the occurrence ranges of ∼10,000 lotic fish species worldwide due to ∼40,000 existing large dams and ∼3,700 additional future large hydropower dams. Per river basin, we quantified a connectivity index (CI) for each fish species by combining its occurrence range with a high-resolution hydrography and the locations of the dams. Ranges of nondiadromous fish species were more fragmented (less connected) (CI = 73 ± 28\%; mean ± SD) than ranges of diadromous species (CI = 86 ± 19\%). Current levels of fragmentation were highest in the United States, Europe, South Africa, India, and China. Increases in fragmentation due to future dams were especially high in the tropics, with declines in CI of ∼20 to 40 percentage points on average across the species in the Amazon, Niger, Congo, Salween, and Mekong basins. Our assessment can guide river management at multiple scales and in various domains, including strategic hydropower planning, identification of species and basins at risk, and prioritization of restoration measures, such as dam removal and construction of fish bypasses.},

	abstract = {According to the ‘natural flow paradigm’, any departure from the natural flow condition will alter the river ecosystem. River flow regimes have been modified by anthropogenic interventions and climate change is further expected to affect the biotic interactions and the distribution of stream biota by altering streamflow. This study aims to evaluate the hydrologic alteration caused by dam construction and climatic changes in a mesoscale river basin, which is prone to both droughts and monsoonal floods. To analyse the natural flow regime, 15 years of observed streamflow (1950–1965) prior to dam construction is used. Future flow regime is simulated by a calibrated hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), using ensemble of four high resolution ({\textasciitilde}25 km) Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations for the near future (2021–2050) based on the SRES A1B scenario. Finally, to quantify the hydrological alterations of different flow characteristics, the Indicators of Hydrological Alteration (IHA) program based on the Range of Variability Approach (RVA) is used. This approach enables the assessment of ecologically sensitive streamflow parameters for the pre- and post-impact periods in the regions where availability of long-term ecological data is a limiting factor. Results indicate that flow variability has been significantly reduced due to dam construction with high flows being absorbed and pre-monsoon low flows being enhanced by the reservoir. Climate change alone may reduce high peak flows while a combination of dam and climate change may significantly reduce variability by affecting both high and low flows, thereby further disrupting the functioning of riverine ecosystems. We find that, in the Kangsabati River basin, influence of dam is greater than that of the climate change, thereby emphasizing the significance of direct human intervention.},

	abstract = {Ecological communities consist of generalists who interact with proportionally many species, and specialists who interact with proportionally few. The strength of these interactions also varies, with communities typically exhibiting a few strong links embedded within many weak links. Historically, it has been argued that generalists should interact more weakly with their partners than specialists and, since weak interactions are thought to increase community stability, that this pattern increases the stability of diverse communities. Here, we studied model-generated predator-prey communities to explicitly investigate the validity of this argument. In feasible communities—those which were both locally stable and all species had positive biomass—we indeed found that species with many predators or prey are affected by them more weakly than species with few. This relationship, however, is only part of the story. While species with many predators (or prey) tend to be only weakly affected by each of them, these many weak interactions are balanced by a few strong interactions with prey (or predators). These few strong interactions are large enough that, when the effect of predator and prey interactions are combined, it seems that species with many interactions actually interact more strongly than species with few interactions. Though past research has tended to focus on either the arrangement of species interactions or the strength of those interactions, we show here that the two are in fact inextricably linked. This observation has implications for both the realistic design of theoretical models, and the conservation of ecological communities, especially those in which the strength and arrangement of species’ interactions are impacted by biodiversity-loss disturbances such as habitat alteration.},

	abstract = {AbstractDeclines of apex predators can cause dramatic increases of smaller predators and ensuing collapses of their prey. However, recent empirical evidence finds that the disappearance of apex predators does not reduce but can increase prey populations. This poses a great challenge in managing species interactions involving mesopredator release. Here we analyze a mathematical model to explain variable consequences of apex predator loss and to develop management guidelines for prey conservation. The model formulates an intraguild predation system (apex predators, mesopredators, and their shared prey) with mesopredators supplied with additional alternative prey. We show that apex predator loss causes only negative effects on shared prey without alternative prey but has either negative or positive effects with alternative prey. Moreover, when alternative prey is highly abundant, apex predator loss causes strong mesopredator release and reduces shared prey greatly. Finally, the model suggests that a viable management strategy to restore shared prey under much uncertainty about a target system is to allocate a limited control effort not only to both predators but also to alternative prey. Alternative prey for mesopredators may be a crucial ingredient that controls the cascading dynamics of intraguild predation systems and should be considered as an important management target.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Hatchery programmes involving the mass release of cultured fish have been implemented worldwide to supplement wild populations and to increase harvests. Hokkaido Island is one of the most active regions for Pacific salmon hatchery programmes, with ca. 1.2 billion (109) juveniles released annually along a coastline of ca. 3000 km. During the last quarter of the 20th century, coastal catches of chum and pink salmon increased dramatically, whereas those of masu salmon did not. In addition to the development of hatchery technologies, several possible hypotheses may explain these catch trends, including climate change, closing of high-seas fisheries, rehabilitation of water quality, habitat loss caused by damming and channelling, and increased pressure from recreational fisheries. Even when these other factors have been accounted for, it is difficult to evaluate whether all hatchery programmes have actually increased net populations. To use these programmes more effectively, it is necessary to evaluate both their river- and species-specific benefits and compare hatchery programmes with other management tools, such as fishery controls and habitat rehabilitation. Future hatchery programmes should incorporate active, adaptive learning approaches to minimize the risks associated with artificial propagation and to promote sustainable salmon stocks.},

The temperature algorithm is based on statistical downscaling of atmospheric temperatures. The precipitation algorithm incorporates orographic predictors including wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. The resulting data consist of a monthly temperature and precipitation climatology for the years 1979–2013. We compare the data derived from the CHELSA algorithm with other standard gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network. We compare the performance of the new climatologies in species distribution modelling and show that we can increase the accuracy of species range predictions. We further show that CHELSA climatological data has a similar accuracy as other products for temperature, but that its predictions of precipitation patterns are better.},

	abstract = {Abstract High-resolution raster hydrography maps are a fundamental data source for many geoscience applications. Here we introduce MERIT Hydro, a new global flow direction map at 3-arc sec resolution ({\textasciitilde}90 m at the equator) derived from the latest elevation data (MERIT DEM) and water body data sets (G1WBM, Global Surface Water Occurrence, and OpenStreetMap). We developed a new algorithm to extract river networks near automatically by separating actual inland basins from dummy depressions caused by the errors in input elevation data. After a minimum amount of hand editing, the constructed hydrography map shows good agreement with existing quality-controlled river network data sets in terms of flow accumulation area and river basin shape. The location of river streamlines was realistically aligned with existing satellite-based global river channel data. Relative error in the drainage area was {\textless}0.05 for 90\% of Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC) gauges, confirming the accuracy of the delineated global river networks. Discrepancies in flow accumulation area were found mostly in arid river basins containing depressions that are occasionally connected at high water levels and thus resulting in uncertain watershed boundaries. MERIT Hydro improves on existing global hydrography data sets in terms of spatial coverage (between N90 and S60) and representation of small streams, mainly due to increased availability of high-quality baseline geospatial data sets. The new flow direction and flow accumulation maps, along with accompanying supplementary layers on hydrologically adjusted elevation and channel width, will advance geoscience studies related to river hydrology at both global and local scales.},

Whitebox GAT was designed to provide a platform for the rapid development and testing of experimental geospatial analysis methods, supported by its extensible design, integrated facilities for custom plug-in tool authoring, and its novel open-access design philosophy. One of the unique characteristics of Whitebox GAT is the ease with which users can inspect and modify the algorithms for individual geoprocessing tools. The open-access software model that Whitebox GAT adopts is designed to lessen the barriers that are often imposed on end-users when attempting to gain deeper understanding of how a speciﬁc function operates. While Whitebox GAT has an extensive range of GIS and remote sensing analytical capabilities, making it broadly suited for advanced scientiﬁc research applications in the Earth Sciences, this paper focusses on the software's application in the ﬁeld of geomorphometry. An airborne LiDAR data set for a small headwater catchment of the Missisquoi River in northern Vermont, USA, was ﬁltered to identify ground-points and then interpolated into a 2.0 m resolution bare-Earth DEM. The DEM was processed to remove spurious off-ground objects (mainly buildings), to reduce surface roughness under heavy forest cover, and to hydrologically pre-condition the DEM. These data were then used to extract salient hydrological structures, i.e. the stream network and their associated sub-basins.},

	abstract = {Competition between hatchery-reared and wild salmonids in streams has frequently been described as an important negative ecological interaction, but differences in behavior, physiology, and morphology that potentially affect competitive ability have been studied more than direct tests of competition. We review the differences reported, designs appropriate for testing different hypotheses about competition, and tests of competition reported in the literature. Many studies have provided circumstantial evidence for competition, but the effects of competition were confounded with other variables. Most direct experiments of competition used additive designs that compared treatments in which hatchery fish were introduced into habitats containing wild fish with controls without hatchery fish. These studies are appropriate for quantifying the effects of hatchery fish at specific combinations of fish densities and stream carrying capacity. However, they do not measure the relative competitive ability of hatchery versus wild fish because the competitive ability of hatchery fish is confounded with the increased density that they cause. We are aware of only two published studies that used substitutive experimental designs in which density was held equal among treatments, thereby testing for differences in competitive ability. Additional substitutive experiments will help managers to better understand the ecological risk of stocking hatchery fish.},

	abstract = {Species invasions can have substantial impacts on native species and ecosystems, with important consequences for biodiversity. How these disturbances drive changes in the trophic structure of native food webs through time is poorly understood. Here, we quantify trophic disruption in freshwater food webs to invasion by an apex fish predator, lake trout, using an extensive stable isotope dataset across a natural gradient of uninvaded and invaded lakes in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. Lake trout invasion increased fish diet variability (trophic dispersion), displaced native fishes from their reference diets (trophic displacement), and reorganized macroinvertebrate communities, indicating strong food web disruption. Trophic dispersion was greatest 25 to 50 y after colonization and dissipated as food webs stabilized in later stages of invasion ({\textgreater}50 y). For the native apex predator, bull trout, trophic dispersion preceded trophic displacement, leading to their functional loss in late-invasion food webs. Our results demonstrate how invasive species progressively disrupt native food webs via trophic dispersion and displacement, ultimately yielding biological communities strongly divergent from those in uninvaded ecosystems.},

              Pseudomonas fluorescens
              , we examined whether shared evolutionary history affected the strength of priority effects. We hypothesized that sympatric evolution of populations belonging to the same guild would lead to niche differentiation, resulting in phenotypic complementarity that weakens priority effects. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that priority effects tended to be weaker in sympatrically evolved pairs of immigrating populations than in allopatrically evolved pairs. Furthermore, priority effects were weaker under higher phenotypic complementarity. However, these patterns were observed only in populations with a relatively short history of sympatric evolution, and disappeared when populations had evolved together for a long time. Together, our results suggest that the evolutionary history of organismal traits may dictate the strength of priority effects and, consequently, the extent of historical contingency in the assembly of ecological communities.},

More than 6,000 species of coral reef fishes exist across the world’s tropical oceans, resulting in an almost innumerable array of possible trophic interactions. Distilling general patterns in these interactions across different bioregions stands to improve our understanding of the processes that govern coral reef functioning. Here, we show that across bioregions, tropical coral reef food webs exhibit a remarkable congruence in their trophic interactions. Specifically, by compiling and investigating the structure of six coral reef food webs across distinct bioregions, we show that when accounting for consumer size and resource availability, these food webs share more trophic interactions than expected by chance. In addition, coral reef food webs are dominated by dietary specialists, which makes trophic pathways vulnerable to biodiversity loss. Prey partitioning among these specialists is geographically consistent, and this pattern intensifies when weak interactions are disregarded. Our results suggest that energy flows through coral reef communities along broadly comparable trophic pathways. Yet, these critical pathways are maintained by species with narrow, specialized diets, which threatens the existence of coral reef functioning in the face of biodiversity loss.},

	abstract = {The tropical conservatism hypothesis (TCH) posits that the latitudinal gradient in biological diversity arises because most extant clades of animals and plants originated when tropical environments were more widespread and because the colonization of colder and more seasonal temperate environments is limited by the phylogenetically conserved environmental tolerances of these tropical clades. Recent studies have claimed support of the TCH, indicating that temperate plant diversity stems from a few more recently derived lineages that are nested within tropical clades, with the colonization of the temperate zone being associated with key adaptations to survive colder temperatures and regular freezing. Drought, however, is an additional physiological stress that could shape diversity gradients. Here, we evaluate patterns of evolutionary diversity in plant assemblages spanning the full extent of climatic gradients in North and South America. We find that in both hemispheres, extratropical dry biomes house the lowest evolutionary diversity, while tropical moist forests and many temperate mixed forests harbor the highest. Together, our results support a more nuanced view of the TCH, with environments that are radically different from the ancestral niche of angiosperms having limited, phylogenetically clustered diversity relative to environments that show lower levels of deviation from this niche. Thus, we argue that ongoing expansion of arid environments is likely to entail higher loss of evolutionary diversity not just in the wet tropics but in many extratropical moist regions as well.},

	abstract = {Changes in the distribution and abundance of invasive species can have far-reaching ecological consequences. Programs to control invaders are common but gauging the effectiveness of such programs using carefully controlled, large-scale field experiments is rare, especially at higher trophic levels. Experimental manipulations coupled with long-term demographic monitoring can reveal the mechanistic underpinnings of interspecific competition among apex predators and suggest mitigation options for invasive species. We used a large-scale before–after control–impact removal experiment to investigate the effects of an invasive competitor, the barred owl (
              Strix varia
              ), on the population dynamics of an iconic old-forest native species, the northern spotted owl (
              Strix occidentalis caurina
              ). Removal of barred owls had a strong, positive effect on survival of sympatric spotted owls and a weaker but positive effect on spotted owl dispersal and recruitment. After removals, the estimated mean annual rate of population change for spotted owls stabilized in areas with removals (0.2\% decline per year), but continued to decline sharply in areas without removals (12.1\% decline per year). The results demonstrated that the most substantial changes in population dynamics of northern spotted owls over the past two decades were associated with the invasion, population expansion, and subsequent removal of barred owls. Our study provides experimental evidence of the demographic consequences of competitive release, where a threatened avian predator was freed from restrictions imposed on its population dynamics with the removal of a competitively dominant invasive species.},

	abstract = {Metabolism should drive demography by determining the rates of both biological work and resource demand. Long-standing “rules” for how metabolism should covary with demography permeate biology, from predicting the impacts of climate change to managing fisheries. Evidence for these rules is almost exclusively indirect and in the form of among-species comparisons, while direct evidence is exceptionally rare. In a manipulative field experiment on a sessile marine invertebrate, we created experimental populations that varied in population size (density) and metabolic rate, but not body size. We then tested key theoretical predictions regarding relationships between metabolism and demography by parameterizing population models with lifetime performance data from our field experiment. We found that populations with higher metabolisms had greater intrinsic rates of increase and lower carrying capacities, in qualitative accordance with classic theory. We also found important departures from theory—in particular, carrying capacity declined less steeply than predicted, such that energy use at equilibrium increased with metabolic rate, violating the long-standing axiom of energy equivalence. Theory holds that energy equivalence emerges because resource supply is assumed to be independent of metabolic rate. We find this assumption to be violated under real-world conditions, with potentially far-reaching consequences for the management of biological systems.},

Our results demonstrate that metapopulation capacity could be used to predict the persistence of trophic systems such as prey–predator pairs and food chains in fragmented landscapes. In particular, we derive explicit predictions for food chain length as a function of metapopulation capacity, top-down control, and population dynamical parameters. Under certain assumptions, we show that the fraction of empty patches for the basal species provides a useful indicator to predict the length of food chains that a fragmented landscape can support and confirm this prediction for a host–parasitoid interaction. We further show that the impact of habitat changes on biodiversity can be predicted from changes in metapopulation capacity or approximately by changes in the fraction of empty patches. Our study provides an important step toward a spatially explicit theory of trophic metacommunities and a useful tool for predicting their responses to habitat changes.},

We tested the hypothesis that community diversity, richness and density are higher on complex artificial substrates than on simple ones. Additionally, we hypothesised that the species occurrence would change from the simplest substrates to the more complex ones because complex habitats provide more niches and methods of exploiting environmental resources, thereby supporting larger numbers of organisms. We expected that the periphytic community would present a nestedness pattern when considering the quantitative index and turnover for the qualitative index. The effect of habitat complexity on the beta diversity was mediated by the relative species abundances. The periphytic algae density was higher on the complex substrates, but contrary to our expectations, the species richness and diversity did not increase on the complex substrates. Based on our findings, we suggest that habitat complexity can play a crucial role in structuring beta diversity patterns. However, we highlight that the responses of species turnover and nestedness to the variation in habitat complexity contrasted with the abundance and species occurrence approach. Additionally, we suggest that the species richness patterns in the periphytic community are independent of increases in the number of individuals.},

	abstract = {A system of natural reserves, each surrounded by altered habitat, resembles a system of islands from the point of view of species restricted to natural habitats. Recent advances in island biogeography may provide a detailed basis for understanding what to expect of such a system of reserves. The main conclusions are as follows: The number of species that a reserve can hold at equilibrium is a function of its area and its isolation. Larger reserves, and reserves located close to other reserves, can hold more species. If most of the area of a habitat is destroyed, and a fraction of the area is saved as a reserve, the reserve will initially contain more species than it can hold at equilibrium. The excess will gradually go extinct. The smaller the reserve, the higher will be the extinction rates. Estimates of these extinction rates for bird and mammal species have recently become available in a few cases. Different species require different minimum areas to have a reasonable chance of survival. Some geometric design principles are suggested in order to optimise the function of reserves in saving species.},

	abstract = {A fundamental issue in migration biology is how birds decide when to start their journey, given that arriving too early or too late in a variable environment reduces individual fitness. Internal circannual regulation and predictable cues such as photoperiod prepare birds for migration, while variable external cues such as temperature and wind are thought to fine-tune departure times; however, this has not been demonstrated at the key point at which an individual animal decides to start migrating. In theory, environmental cues correlated between departure and arrival sites allow informed departure decisions. For 48 satellite-tracked Asian houbara
              Chlamydotis macqueenii
              , a medium-distance migrant with climatic connectivity between wintering and breeding areas, each tracked across multiple years, spring departure was under individually consistent temperature conditions, with greater individual repeatability than for photoperiod or wind. Individuals occupied a range of wintering sites latitudinally spanning 1,200 km but departed at lower temperatures from more northerly latitudes. These individual departure decisions produced earlier mean population-level departure and arrival dates in warmer springs. Phenological adjustments were fully compensatory, because individuals arrived on the breeding grounds under similar temperature conditions each year. Individuals’ autumn departure decisions were also repeatable for temperature but less distinct than for spring, likely because of relaxed time constraints on leaving breeding grounds and the use of wind as a supplementary departure cue. We show that individual-level departure decisions informed by local temperatures can preadapt a population to adjust its population-level phenology in response to annual variability in spring temperatures without requiring genetic change in reaction thresholds.},

While most studies of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning have examined randomized species losses, trait-based filtering associated with species-specific vulnerability to drivers of diversity loss can strongly influence how ecosystem functioning responds to declining biodiversity. Moreover, the responses of ecosystem functioning to diversity loss may be mediated by environmental variability interacting with the suite of traits remaining in depauperate communities. We do not yet understand how communities resulting from realistic diversity losses (filtered by response traits) influence ecosystem functioning (via effect traits of the remaining community), especially under variable environmental conditions. Here, we directly test how realistic and randomized plant diversity losses influence productivity and invasion resistance across multiple years in a California grassland. Compared with communities based on randomized diversity losses, communities resulting from realistic (drought-driven) species losses had higher invasion resistance under climatic conditions that matched the trait-based filtering they experienced. However, productivity declined more with realistic than with randomized species losses across all years, regardless of climatic conditions. Functional response traits aligned with effect traits for productivity but not for invasion resistance. Our findings illustrate that the effects of biodiversity losses depend not only on the identities of lost species but also on how the traits of remaining species interact with varying environmental conditions. Understanding the consequences of biodiversity change requires studies that evaluate trait-mediated effects of species losses and incorporate the increasingly variable climatic conditions that future communities are expected to experience.},

	abstract = {As climate change unfolds, changes in population dynamics and species distribution ranges are expected to fundamentally reshuffle communities worldwide. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and extent of community reorganization remains elusive. This is particularly true in riverine systems, which are simultaneously exposed to changing temperature and streamflow, and where land-use change continues to be a major driver of biodiversity loss. Here, we use the most comprehensive compilation of fish abundance time series to date to provide a global synthesis of climate- and LU-induced effects on riverine biota with respect to changes in species thermal and streamflow affinities. We demonstrate that fish communities are increasingly dominated by thermophilic (warm-water) and limnophilic (slow-water) species. Despite being consistent with trends in water temperature and streamflow observed over recent decades, these community changes appear largely decoupled from each other and show wide spatial variation. We further reveal a synergy among climate- and land use-related drivers, such that community thermophilization is heightened in more human-modified systems. Importantly, communities in which species experience thermal and flow regimes that approach or exceed their tolerance thresholds (high community sensitivity), as well as species-poor communities (low community resilience), also display faster rates of compositional change. This research illustrates that quantifying vulnerability of riverine systems to climate change requires a broadening from a narrower thermal focus to more integrative approaches that account for the spatially varying and multifaceted sensitivity of riverine organisms to the interactive effects of water temperature, hydrology, and other anthropogenic changes.},

Piscivory by fish is a dominant factor in both stream and lake systems whereas evidence for the importance of competition appears less convincing. Within small streams or lakes, the impact of predation may exclude other species, thereby leading to mutually exclusive distributions and strong differences in community composition. Within a geographic region, abiotic effects frequently dictate the relative importance of piscivory, thereby indirectly influencing the composition of prey species present. The spatial scale of studies influences our perceived importance of biotic versus abiotic factors, with small-scale studies indicating a greater importance of competition and large-scale studies emphasizing abiotic controls. The scale of the individual sites considered is critical because smaller systems have higher variability and wider extremes of conditions than larger lakes and rivers. The stability of physical systems and degree of spatial connectivity contribute to increased diversity in both larger stream and larger lake systems. We identify challenges and needs that must be addressed both to advance the field of fish community ecology and to face the problems associated with human-induced changes.},

	abstract = {Natural ecological communities are diverse, complex, and often surprisingly stable, but the mechanisms underlying their stability remain a theoretical enigma. Interactions such as competition and predation presumably structure communities, yet theory predicts that complex communities are stable only when species growth rates are mostly limited by intraspecific self-regulation rather than by interactions with resources, competitors, and predators. Current theory, however, considers only the network topology of population-level interactions between species and ignores within-population differences, such as between juvenile and adult individuals. Here, using model simulations and analysis, I show that including commonly observed differences in vulnerability to predation and foraging efficiency between juvenile and adult individuals results in up to 10 times larger, more complex communities than observed in simulations without population stage structure. These diverse communities are stable or fluctuate with limited amplitude, although in the model only a single basal species is self-regulated, and the population-level interaction network is highly connected. Analysis of the species interaction matrix predicts the simulated communities to be unstable but for the interaction with the population-structure subsystem, which completely cancels out these instabilities through dynamic changes in population stage structure. Common differences between juveniles and adults and fluctuations in their relative abundance may hence have a decisive influence on the stability of complex natural communities and their vulnerability when environmental conditions change. To explain community persistence, it may not be sufficient to consider only the network of interactions between the constituting species.},

In the model, individual plants spread along a branched network via directional dispersal and undergo neutral ecological drift. Simulation results suggest that in comparison to 2-D landscapes with non-directional dispersal, river networks with directional dispersal have lower local ðaÞ and overall ðgÞ diversities, but higher between-community ðbÞ diversity, implying that riparian species are distributed in a more localized pattern and more vulnerable to local extinction. The relative abundance patterns also change, such that higher percentages of species are in low-abundance, or rare, classes, accompanied by concave rank-abundance curves. In contrast to existing theories, the results suggest that in river networks, increased directional dispersal reduces a diversity. These altered patterns and trends result from the combined effects of directionality of dispersal and river network structure, whose relative importance is in need of continuing study. In addition, riparian communities obeying neutral dynamics seem to exhibit abrupt changes where large tributaries conﬂuence; this pattern may provide a signature to identify types of interspeciﬁc dynamics in river networks.},

	abstract = {The stable flow and temperature regimes of spring-fed streams are distinct from the dynamic regimes of other streams. We investigated differences in habitat and macroinvertebrate assemblages among three stream types (spring-fed tributary, nonspring-fed tributary, and mainstream) in a clastic lowland of northern Japan. Current velocity was the slowest in the springfed reach, where the percent of fine sediment deposition was also 3.8–11.4 times higher than in the other stream types. The standing stock of detritus was also greater in the spring-fed reach. These results suggest that the stable flow regime in the spring-fed stream leads to the accumulation of fine sediment and detritus on the streambed. Oligochaeta and chironomids, which are burrower-gatherers, were remarkably abundant in the spring-fed reach. Total macroinvertebrate abundance was 3.8–12.2 times greater in the spring-fed reach than in the other stream types. Sprawler-grazer ephemeropterans were the most abundant in the mainstream reaches, likely due to higher primary productivity. Allomyia sp, which depend on cool spring-fed habitats, was found only in the spring-fed reach. The indicator species analysis also indicated multiple taxa of detritivores and Allomyia sp. for the spring-fed tributary. The macroinvertebrate assemblage in the spring-fed reach was characterized by numerous burrowers, collector-gatherers, and crenobiont taxa, highlighting the uniqueness and its contribution to enhance beta diversity in river networks.},

As biodiversity change accelerates, we are still discovering the full range of consequences for human health and well-being. Here, we test the hypothesis—derived from biodiversity–ecosystem functioning theory—that species richness and ecological functional diversity allow seafood diets to fulfill multiple nutritional requirements, a condition necessary for human health. We analyzed a newly synthesized dataset of 7,245 observations of nutrient and contaminant concentrations in 801 aquatic animal taxa and found that species with different ecological traits have distinct and complementary micronutrient profiles but little difference in protein content. The same complementarity mechanisms that generate positive biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning in terrestrial ecosystems also operate in seafood assemblages, allowing more diverse diets to yield increased nutritional benefits independent of total biomass consumed. Notably, nutritional metrics that capture multiple micronutrients and fatty acids essential for human well-being depend more strongly on biodiversity than common ecological measures of function such as productivity, typically reported for grasslands and forests. Furthermore, we found that increasing species richness did not increase the amount of protein in seafood diets and also increased concentrations of toxic metal contaminants in the diet. Seafood-derived micronutrients and fatty acids are important for human health and are a pillar of global food and nutrition security. By drawing upon biodiversity–ecosystem functioning theory, we demonstrate that ecological concepts of biodiversity can deepen our understanding of nature’s benefits to people and unite sustainability goals for biodiversity and human well-being.},

	abstract = {Constructed wetlands are recognised as a cost-effective and socially acceptable stormwater treatment option within urban landscapes, satisfying a range of urban design objectives, including flood protection and treating stormwater. While wetlands also provide habitat for aquatic biota, and often act as a refuge for wildlife, there is growing concern that as wetlands become polluted, they could become toxic to aquatic life and lead to extensive costs for the disposal of sediments. Currently, there is little consideration given to how land use activity in wetland catchments contributes to this pollution. Here we assessed the sediment quality of 98 constructed wetlands across an urban landscape and determined whether concentrations of pollutants present can be correlated to catchment land uses, geology or wetland age. Using boosted regression trees, we find that land use type is an important determinant of the concentrations of heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons in sediments. Wetlands with {\textgreater}10\% industries in their catchments have significantly higher sediment-bound concentrations of trace metals than wetlands draining catchments with little industrialisation. Furthermore, these industrial wetlands have a much greater risk of exceeding ecological and waste disposal guidelines, while wetlands with catchments comprising primarily residential or peri-urban have significantly lower risk of becoming polluted. Results also suggest that the age of wetlands and their catchment geology significantly influences sediment quality. This research improves our understanding of the factors influencing pollution in urban areas and will enable wetlands to be better designed and managed to minimise their environmental impacts and maintenance costs.},

	abstract = {Pesticides play a pivotal role in controlling pests and disease infestations not only in urban agriculture but also in non-agricultural settings. Several pesticides like herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, etc. are applied unintentionally at higher concentrations even in small urban areas such as lawns, gardens and impermeable surfaces. Consequent to their indiscriminate use, both extensively and intensively, in the urban areas, contamination of pesticides poses a serious threat to the environment, living organisms and food safety. Although the fate and ecological effects of pesticides and their residues have been thoroughly understood in agricultural soils, information available in the literature on the impact of these contaminants in the urban environment is very limited and fragmentary. In fact, the fate and behaviour of pesticide residues in the urban environment are distinct from those in other ecosystems since the soils in urban areas greatly vary in their physico-chemical properties. Development of sustainable and eco-friendly approaches for remediation of even urban soils contaminated with pesticides is therefore greatly warranted. Thus, the present critical review is the first single source that provides updated knowledge on the sources, nature and extent of pesticide pollution in the urban environment, and the ecological and human health effects of pesticides and their residues. The potential of nano-encapsulation of pesticides for their application in urban settings has also been discussed.},

This paper reviews recent literature on non-market valuation as applied to wetlands, with a particular focus on the value of urban wetlands. Wetland valuation studies have generated a wide range of values, in part due to differences in what is valued and in part due to differences in methodology. Several studies have shown that property owners value proximity to wetlands in urban areas. In addition, studies have found positive values for recreation (ﬁshing and hunting), commercial ﬁshing, water puriﬁcation, and other ecosystem services provided by wetlands, although little of this work has been done on urban wetlands. Valuation studies can provide useful information about relative rankings of value, showing, for example, that certain types of wetlands or certain services are more highly valued than others. Whether the absolute magnitude of valuation estimates is correct is less clear.},

We then separately include resource competition based on shared capture area. By varying rates of growth, death, and competitive attrition, we connect regular and random spatial patterns across sessile organisms from forests to ants, termites, and fairy circles. Then, we consider transient temporal dynamics in the context of asymmetric competition, such as canopy shading or large colony dominance, whose effects primarily weaken the smaller of two competitors. When such competition couples slow timescales of growth to fast competitive death, it generates population shocks and demographic oscillations similar to those observed in forest data. Our minimal quantitative theory unifies spatiotemporal patterns across sessile organisms through local competition mediated by the laws of metabolic growth, which in turn, are the result of long-term evolutionary dynamics.},

Theoretical fisheries models have shown that harvest can actually increase the equilibrium size of a population, and uncontrolled studies and anecdotal reports have documented population increases in response to invasive species removal (akin to fisheries harvest). Both findings may be driven by high levels of juvenile survival associated with low adult abundance, often referred to as overcompensation. Here we show that in a coastal marine ecosystem, an eradication program resulted in stage-specific overcompensation and a 30-fold, single-year increase in the population of an introduced predator. Data collected concurrently from four adjacent regional bays without eradication efforts showed no similar population increase, indicating a local and not a regional increase. Specifically, the eradication program had inadvertently reduced the control of recruitment by adults via cannibalism, thereby facilitating the population explosion. Mesocosm experiments confirmed that adult cannibalism of recruits was size-dependent and could control recruitment. Genomic data show substantial isolation of this population and implicate internal population dynamics for the increase, rather than recruitment from other locations. More broadly, this controlled experimental demonstration of stage-specific overcompensation in an aquatic system provides an important cautionary message for eradication efforts of species with limited connectivity and similar life histories.},

	abstract = {Distributions of species, animals or plants, terrestrial or aquatic, are inﬂuenced by numerous factors such as physical and biogeographical gradients. Dominant wind and current directions cause the appearance of gradients in physical conditions whereas biogeographical gradients can be the result of historical events (e.g. glaciations). No spatial modelling technique has been developed to this day that considers the direction of an asymmetric process controlling species distributions along a gradient or network. This paper presents a new method that can model species spatial distributions generated by a hypothesized asymmetric, directional physical process. This method is an eigenfunction-based spatial ﬁltering technique that offers as much ﬂexibility as the Moran’s eigenvector maps (MEM) framework; it is called asymmetric eigenvector maps (AEM) modelling. Information needed to construct eigenfunctions through the AEM framework are the spatial coordinates of the sampling or experimental sites, a connexion diagram linking the sites to one another, prior information about the direction of the hypothesized asymmetric process inﬂuencing the response variable(s), and optionally, weights attached to the edges (links). To illustrate how this new method works, AEM is compared to MEM analysis through simulations and in the analysis of an ecological example where a known asymmetric forcing is present. The ecological example reanalyses the dietary habits of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) sampled in 42 lakes of the Mastigouche Reserve, Que´ bec.},

Naturally selective forces may create countering selection pressures. Assessing natural fitness represents a considerable challenge in broadcast spawners. Thus, our understanding about the relative strength of natural and fisheries selection is slim. In the field, we compared the strength and shape of harvest selection to natural selection on body size over four years and behavior over one year in a natural population of a freshwater top predator, the northern pike (
              Esox lucius
              ). Natural selection was approximated by relative reproductive success via parent–offspring genetic assignments over four years. Harvest selection was measured by comparing individuals susceptible to recreational angling with individuals never captured by this gear type. Individual behavior was measured by high-resolution acoustic telemetry. Harvest and natural size selection operated with equal strength but opposing directions, and harvest size selection was consistently negative in all study years. Harvest selection also had a substantial behavioral component independent of body length, while natural behavioral selection was not documented, suggesting the potential for directional harvest selection favoring inactive, timid fish. Simulations of the outcomes of different fishing regulations showed that traditional minimum size-based harvest limits are unlikely to counteract harvest selection without being completely restrictive. Our study suggests harvest selection may be inevitable and recreational fisheries may thus favor small, inactive, shy, and difficult-to-capture fish. Increasing fractions of shy fish in angling-exploited stocks would have consequences for stock assessment and all fisheries operating with hook and line.},

However, larval dispersal patterns are variable, which leads to temporal fluctuations in the contribution of a single reserve to the replenishment of local populations. Identifying management strategies that mitigate the uncertainty in larval supply will help ensure the stability of recruitment dynamics and minimize the volatility in fishery catches. Here, we use genetic parentage analysis to show extreme variability in both the dispersal patterns and recruitment contribution of four individual marine reserves across six discrete recruitment cohorts for coral grouper (
              Plectropomus maculatus

This dampening effect reduces the variability in larval supply from individual reserves by a factor of 1.8, which effectively halves the uncertainty in the recruitment contribution of individual reserves. Thus, not only does the network of four marine reserves generate valuable larval subsidies to neighboring habitats, the aggregate effect of individual reserves mitigates temporal fluctuations in dispersal patterns and the replenishment of local populations. Our results indicate that small networks of marine reserves yield previously unrecognized stabilizing benefits that ensure a consistent larval supply to replenish exploited fish stocks.},

Across realms, we found a common structure in the distribution of species traits despite a 10-fold gradient in species richness, with a defined “backbone” of 21 trait combinations shared by all realms globally, both temperate and tropical. Across ecoregions, assemblages under similar environmental conditions had similar trait compositions despite hosting drastically different species pools from separate evolutionary lineages. Thus, despite being separated by thousands of kilometers and millions of years of evolution, similar environments host similar trait compositions in reef fish assemblages worldwide. Our findings suggest that similar trait-based management strategies can be applied among regions with distinct species pools, potentially improving conservation outcomes across diverse jurisdictions.},

Through application of large water-temperature databases evaluated for sensitivity to historical air-temperature variability and computationally interpolated to provide high-resolution thermal habitat information for a 222,000-km network, we estimate a less dire thermal plight for cold-water species within mountains of the northwestern United States. Stream warming rates and climate velocities were both relatively low for 1968–2011 (average warming rate = 0.101 °C/decade; median velocity = 1.07 km/decade) when air temperatures warmed at 0.21 °C/decade. Many cold-water vertebrate species occurred in a subset of the network characterized by low climate velocities, and three native species of conservation concern occurred in extremely cold, slow velocity environments (0.33–0.48 km/decade). Examination of aggressive warming scenarios indicated that although network climate velocities could increase, they remain low in headwaters because of strong local temperature gradients associated with topographic controls. Better information about changing hydrology and disturbance regimes is needed to complement these results, but rather than being climatic cul-de-sacs, many mountain streams appear poised to be redoubts for cold-water biodiversity this century.},

	abstract = {Abstract Several key processes in freshwater ecology are governed by the connectivity inherent to dendritic river networks. These have extensively been analyzed from a geomorphological and hydrological viewpoint, yet structures classically used in ecological modeling have been poorly representative of the structure of real river basins, often failing to capture well-known scaling features of natural rivers. Pioneering work identified optimal channel networks (OCNs) as spanning trees reproducing all scaling features characteristic of natural stream networks worldwide. While OCNs have been used to create landscapes for studies on metapopulations, biodiversity, and epidemiology, their generation has not been generally accessible. Given the increasing interest in dendritic riverine networks by ecologists and evolutionary biologists, we here present a method to generate OCNs and, to facilitate its application, we provide the R-package OCNet. Owing to the stochastic process generating OCNs, multiple network replicas spanning the same surface can be built; this allows performing computational experiments whose results are irrespective of the particular shape of a single river network. The OCN construct also enables the generation of elevational gradients derived from the optimal network configuration, which can constitute three-dimensional landscapes for spatial studies in both terrestrial and freshwater realms. Moreover, the package provides functions that aggregate OCNs into an arbitrary number of nodes, calculate several descriptors of river networks, and draw relevant network features. We describe the main functionalities of the package and its integration with other R-packages commonly used in spatial ecology. Moreover, we exemplify the generation of OCNs and discuss an application to a metapopulation model for an invasive riverine species. In conclusion, OCNet provides a powerful tool to generate realistic river network analogues for various applications. It thereby allows the design of spatially realistic studies in increasingly impacted ecosystems and enhances our knowledge on spatial processes in freshwater ecology in general.},

While species interactions are highly vulnerable to disturbance, little is known about the roles that introduced species play in novel interaction networks and what processes underlie such roles. Studying one of the most extreme cases of human-modified ecosystems, the island of Oʻahu, Hawaii, we show that introduced species there shape the structure of seed dispersal networks to a greater extent than native species. Although both neutral and niche-based processes influenced network structure, niche-based processes played a larger role, despite theory predicting neutral processes to be predominantly important for islands. In fact, ecological correlates of species’ roles (morphology, behavior, abundance) were largely similar to those in native-dominated networks. However, the most important ecological correlates varied with spatial scale and trophic level, highlighting the importance of examining these factors separately to unravel processes determining species contributions to network structure. Although introduced species integrate into interaction networks more deeply than previously thought, by examining the mechanistic basis of species’ roles we can use traits to identify species that can be removed from (or added to) a system to improve crucial ecosystem functions, such as seed dispersal.},

Today, 75\% of terrestrial ecosystems are considerably altered by human activities, and landscape transformation continues to accelerate. Human impacts are one of the major drivers of the current biodiversity crisis, and they have had unprecedented consequences on ecosystem function and rates of species extinctions for thousands of years. Here we use the fossil record to investigate whether changes in geographic range that could result from human impacts have altered the climatic niches of 46 species covering six mammal orders within the contiguous United States. Sixty-seven percent of the studied mammals have significantly different climatic niches today than they did before the onset of the Industrial Revolution. Niches changed the most in the portions of the range that overlap with human-impacted landscapes. Whether by forcible elimination/introduction or more indirect means, large-bodied dietary specialists have been extirpated from climatic envelopes that characterize human-impacted areas, whereas smaller, generalist mammals have been facilitated, colonizing these same areas of the climatic space. Importantly, the climates where we find mammals today do not necessarily represent their past habitats. Without mitigation, as we move further into the Anthropocene, we can anticipate a low standing biodiversity dominated by small, generalist mammals.},

              Similarity measures are among the most intuitive and common measures for comparing two or more sites, or samples, with respect to their species overlap. A restriction of similarity measures is that they are limited to pairwise comparisons even in a multiple-site study. This work presents a multiple-site similarity measure that makes use of information on species shared by more than two sites and avoids the problem of covariance between pairwise similarities in a multiple-site study. Further, we show that our multiple-site similarity measure is related to
              β
              -diversity measures such as Whittaker's
              β
              -diversity. Similarity measures can also be used as descriptors of effective specialization of insects to host species by measuring similarity from host observations. Finally, we show that multiple-site similarity and host specificity are two sides of the same coin.},

The climatic niche breadth was greater, and extinction risk was lower in polymorphic species than in monomorphic species in all taxa analysed.

	abstract = {For species to stay temporally tuned to their environment, they use cues such as the accumulation of degree-days. The relationships between the timing of a phenological event in a population and its environmental cue can be described by a population-level reaction norm. Variation in reaction norms along environmental gradients may either intensify the environmental effects on timing (cogradient variation) or attenuate the effects (countergradient variation). To resolve spatial and seasonal variation in species’ response, we use a unique dataset of 91 taxa and 178 phenological events observed across a network of 472 monitoring sites, spread across the nations of the former Soviet Union. We show that compared to local rates of advancement of phenological events with the advancement of temperature-related cues (i.e., variation within site over years), spatial variation in reaction norms tend to accentuate responses in spring (cogradient variation) and attenuate them in autumn (countergradient variation). As a result, among-population variation in the timing of events is greater in spring and less in autumn than if all populations followed the same reaction norm regardless of location. Despite such signs of local adaptation, overall phenotypic plasticity was not sufficient for phenological events to keep exact pace with their cues—the earlier the year, the more did the timing of the phenological event lag behind the timing of the cue. Overall, these patterns suggest that differences in the spatial versus temporal reaction norms will affect species’ response to climate change in opposite ways in spring and autumn.},

              Globally, lake surface water temperatures have warmed rapidly relative to air temperatures, but changes in deepwater temperatures and vertical thermal structure are still largely unknown. We have compiled the most comprehensive data set to date of long-term (1970–2009) summertime vertical temperature profiles in lakes across the world to examine trends and drivers of whole-lake vertical thermal structure. We found significant increases in surface water temperatures across lakes at an average rate of + 0.37 °C decade
              −1
              , comparable to changes reported previously for other lakes, and similarly consistent trends of increasing water column stability (+ 0.08 kg m
              −3
              decade
              −1
              ). In contrast, however, deepwater temperature trends showed little change on average (+ 0.06 °C decade
              −1
              ), but had high variability across lakes, with trends in individual lakes ranging from − 0.68 °C decade
              −1
              to + 0.65 °C decade
              −1
              . The variability in deepwater temperature trends was not explained by trends in either surface water temperatures or thermal stability within lakes, and only 8.4\% was explained by lake thermal region or local lake characteristics in a random forest analysis. These findings suggest that external drivers beyond our tested lake characteristics are important in explaining long-term trends in thermal structure, such as local to regional climate patterns or additional external anthropogenic influences.},

	abstract = {Patterns in species incidence and compositional turnover are central to understanding what drives biodiversity. Here we propose zeta (z) diversity, the number of species shared by multiple assemblages, as a concept and metric that uniﬁes incidence-based diversity measures, patterns, and relationships. Unlike other measures of species compositional turnover, zeta diversity partitioning quantiﬁes the complete set of diversity components for multiple assemblages, comprehensively representing the spatial structure of multispecies distributions. To illustrate the application and ecological value of zeta diversity, we show how it scales with sample number, grain, and distance. Zeta diversity reconciles several different biodiversity patterns, including the species accumulation curve, the species-area relationship, multispecies occupancy patterns, and scaling of species endemism. Exponential and power-law forms of zeta diversity are associated with stochastic versus niche assembly processes. Zeta diversity may provide new insights on biodiversity patterns, the processes driving them, and their response to environmental change.},

	abstract = {Artificial nightlight is increasingly recognized as an important environmental disturbance that influences the habitats and fitness of numerous species. However, its effects on wide-ranging vertebrates and their interactions remain unclear. Light pollution has the potential to amplify land-use change, and as such, answering the question of how this sensory stimulant affects behavior and habitat use of species valued for their ecological roles and economic impacts is critical for conservation and land-use planning. Here, we combined satellite-derived estimates of light pollution, with GPS-data from cougars Puma concolor (n = 56), mule deer Odocoileus hemionus (n = 263) and locations of cougar-killed deer (n = 1562 carcasses), to assess the effects of light exposure on mammal behavior and predator–prey relationships across wildland–urban gradients in the southwestern United States. Our results indicate that deer used the anthropogenic environments to access forage and were more active at night than their wildland conspecifics. Despite higher nightlight levels, cougars killed deer at the wildland–urban interface, but hunted them in the relatively darkest locations. Light had the greatest effect of all covariates on where cougars killed deer at the wildland–urban interface. Both species exhibited functional responses to light pollution at fine scales; individual cougars and deer with less light exposure increasingly avoided illuminated areas when exposed to greater radiance, whereas deer living in the wildland–urban interface selected elevated light levels. We conclude that integrating estimates of light pollution into ecological studies provides crucial insights into how the dynamic human footprint can alter animal behavior and ecosystem function across spatial scales.},

Resource pulses can beneﬁt growth, reproduction, and abundance of various consumers. Yet, it is relatively unknown how such resources are partitioned among competing consumers and how this is inﬂuenced by the magnitude of the pulse. Here, we examined how the magnitude of a pulsed resource inﬂuences resource partitioning among diverse sizes and species of consumers in a natural setting over small spatial and temporal scales. We focused on salmon egg subsidies to stream ﬁsh consumers. We experimentally added different quantities of pink salmon eggs to ﬁve meter long experimental stream sections. Egg additions spanned three orders of magnitude from 6 to 3575 eggs. Stream ﬁsh (egg consumers) were captured and gastric lavaged at each experimental section to determine how many eggs each individual ﬁsh consumed. We modeled taxon-speciﬁc individual egg consumption as a function of egg availability, individual mass, community composition, number of competitors, and stream velocity using hurdle models in a Bayesian framework. We found that there were diminishing returns for increasing egg abundance increasing egg consumption (i.e., type II functional response) for individual size classes of ﬁsh, but that higher egg numbers were needed to beneﬁt diverse consumers. Top models indicated that egg availability and individual ﬁsh characteristics (size and taxon) drove egg consumption, while community characteristics (species composition and number of competitors) were not supported. Our results suggest that resource pulses can provide rare opportunities for less dominant sizes and species of ﬁsh to consume abundant resources. The current paradigm in the stream ﬁsh literature suggests that stream ﬁsh communities are structured by dominance hierarchies; however, dominance hierarchies may be less inﬂuential where pulsed resources comprise a large portion of the resource base.},

The apparent consistency of the SPAR for natural areas suggested that it could be used to predict the number of species that would be maintained within the isolated conﬁnes of a nature reserve. This proposed use of the SPAR led to heated debates about how best to partition space among reserves. However, by the end of the 1980s, the SPAR was no longer a central issue in reserve design. There was too much uncertainty about the underlying causes of the SPAR to trust that it would hold for reserves. The SPAR was also inappropriate for the design of single-species reserves and thus did not answer the traditional needs of wildlife managers. Ecologists subsequently focused their reserve-design efforts on the management of individual populations to reduce the probability of extinction and the loss of genetic variation. Nevertheless, because the SPAR does not require detailed knowledge of the requirements of individual species, it is still used to estimate local species richness and to predict the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity. These applications of the SPAR may be especially useful in the design of marine reserves, which often differ in purpose from conventional terrestrial reserves and may require fundamentally different approaches. Key words: biodiversity; marine reserves; reserve design; species–area relationship.},

	abstract = {This paper demonstrates how the power form of the Species–Area Relationship (SAR) can be used to set conservation targets for land classes using biodiversity survey data. The log-transformation of the power model is a straight line; therefore, if one knows the average number of species recorded per survey site and can estimate the true species number present in the land class, using EstimateS software, it is possible to calculate the slope of the curve, or z-value. The z-value is the exponent in the power model and it can then be used to estimate the proportion of area required to represent a given proportion of species present in any land class. This application of the SAR is explored using phytosociological relevé data from South Africa’s Succulent Karoo biome. We also provide suggestions for extrapolating the estimated z-values to other land classes within a bioregion that lack sufficient survey data, using the relationship between z-values and remotely determined landscape variables such as habitat diversity (topographic diversity) and geographic location (latitude and longitude). The SAR predicts that for most Succulent Karoo vegetation types a conservation target of 10\% of the land area would not be sufficient to conserve the majority of species. We also demonstrate that not all land classes are equal from a plant biodiversity perspective, so applying one target to all land classes in a region will lead to significant gaps and inefficiencies in any reserve network based on this universal target.},

We used 33,890 scenes from 4 GLS epochs in order to delineate a seamless water body map, without cloud and ice/snow gaps. Permanent water bodies were distinguished from temporal water-covered areas by calculating the frequency of water body existence from overlapping, multi-temporal, Landsat scenes. By analyzing the frequency of water body existence at 3arc-second resolution, the G3WBM separates river channels and floodplains more clearly than previous studies. This suggests that the use of multi-temporal images is as important as analysis at a higher resolution for global water body mapping. The global totals of delineated permanent water body area and temporal water-covered area are 3.25 and 0.49millionkm2 respectively, which highlights the importance of river-floodplain separation using multi-temporal images. The accuracy of the water body classification was validated in Hokkaido (Japan) and in the contiguous United States using an existing water body databases. There was almost no commission error, and about 70\% of lakes {\textgreater}1km2 shows relative water area error {\textless}25\%. Though smaller water bodies ({\textless}1km2) were underestimated mainly due to omission of shoreline pixels, the overall accuracy of the G3WBM should be adequate for larger scale research in hydrology, biogeochemistry, and climate systems and importantly includes a quantification of the temporal nature of global water bodies.},

In the last century, we have been building disaster prevention infrastructure (artificial levees and dams, referred to as “grey infrastructure”) to protect human lives and assets from floods, but these hard protective measures will not function against mega-floods. Moreover, in a drastically depopulating society such as that in Japan, farmland abandonment prevails, and it will be more difficult to maintain grey infrastructure with a limited tax income. In this study, we propose the introduction of green infrastructure (GI) as an adaptation strategy for climate change. If we can use abandoned farmlands as GI, they may function to reduce disaster risks and provide habitats for various organisms that are adapted to wetland environments. First, we present a conceptual framework for disaster prevention using a hybrid of GI and conventional grey infrastructure. In this combination, the fundamental GI, composed of forests and wetlands in the catchment (GI-1) and additional multilevel GIs such as flood control basins that function when floodwater exceeds the planning level (GI-2) are introduced. We evaluated the flood attenuation function (GI-1) of the Kushiro Wetland using a hydrological model and developed a methodology for selecting suitable locations of GI-2, considering flood risk, biodiversity and the distribution of abandoned farmlands, which represent social and economic costs. The results indicated that the Kushiro Wetland acts as a large natural reservoir that attenuates the hydrological peak discharge during floods and suitable locations for introducing GI-2 are concentrated in floodplain areas developing in the downstream reaches of large rivers. Finally, we discussed the network structure of GI-1 as a hub and GI-2 as a dispersal site for conservation of the Red-crowned Crane, one of the symbolic species of Japan.},

These floral trait changes can be regarded as honest signals of reward states for pollinators. Previous studies have hypothesized that these signals are used to maintain plant-level attractiveness to pollinators, but the evolutionary conditions leading to the development of honest signals have not been well investigated from a theoretical basis. We examined conditions leading to the evolution of honest reward signals in flowers by applying a theoretical model that included pollinator response and signal accuracy. We assumed that pollinators learn floral traits and plant locations in association with reward states and use this information to decide which flowers to visit. While manipulating the level of associative learning, we investigated optimal flower longevity, the proportion of reward and rewardless flowers, and honest- and dishonest-signalling strategies. We found that honest signals are evolutionarily stable only when flowers are visited by pollinators with both high and low learning abilities. These findings imply that behavioural variation in learning within a pollinator community can lead to the evolution of an honest signal even when there is no contribution of rewardless flowers to pollinator attractiveness.},

Here, we present a fundamental reconception of the framework that explicitly links local coexistence theory to the spatial processes inherent to metacommunity theory, allowing for a continuous range of competitive community dynamics. These dynamics emerge from the three underlying processes that shape ecological communities: (1) density-independent responses to abiotic conditions, (2) density-dependent biotic interactions and (3) dispersal. Stochasticity is incorporated in the demographic realisation of each of these processes. We formalise this framework using a simulation model that explores a wide range of competitive metacommunity dynamics by varying the strength of the underlying processes. Using this model and framework, we show how existing theories, including the traditional metacommunity archetypes, are linked by this common set of processes. We then use the model to generate new hypotheses about how the three processes combine to interactively shape diversity, functioning and stability within metacommunities.},

We stress the importance of space-mediated stability for the coexistence of competing species and explore the ecological consequences of spaceinduced instabilities (Turing instabilities) for spatial pattern formation in predator–prey systems. Throughout, we link existing theory to recent developments in discrete spatially structured metapopulations, such as our understanding of how ecological dynamics occurring on a network can be analyzed using the Laplacian matrix and its associated eigenvalue spectrum.

Although metacommunity theory has considered trophic dynamics in the past, it has been performed idiosyncratically with a wide selection of possible dynamics. Trophic metacommunity theory needs a synthesis of a few inﬂuential axis to simplify future predictions and tests. We propose an extension of metacommunity ecology that addresses these shortcomings by incorporating variability among trophic levels in ‘spatial use properties’. We deﬁne ‘spatial use properties’ as a set of traits (dispersal, migration, foraging and spatial information processing) that set the spatial and temporal scales of organismal movement, and thus scales of interspeciﬁc interactions. Progress towards a synthetic predictive framework can be made by (1) documenting patterns of spatial use properties in natural food webs and (2) using theory and experiments to test how trophic structure in spatial use properties affects metacommunity dynamics.},

	abstract = {The reed Phragmites australis Cav. is aggressively invading salt marshes along the Atlantic Coast of North America. We examined the interactive role of habitat alteration (i.e., shoreline development) in driving this invasion and its consequences for plant richness in New England salt marshes. We surveyed 22 salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, and quantified shoreline development, Phragmites cover, soil salinity, and nitrogen availability. Shoreline development, operationally defined as removal of the woody vegetation bordering marshes, explained {\textgreater}90\% of intermarsh variation in Phragmites cover. Shoreline development was also significantly correlated with reduced soil salinities and increased nitrogen availability, suggesting that removing woody vegetation bordering marshes increases nitrogen availability and decreases soil salinities, thus facilitating Phragmites invasion. Soil salinity (64\%) and nitrogen availability (56\%) alone explained a large proportion of variation in Phragmites cover, but together they explained 80\% of the variation in Phragmites invasion success. Both univariate and aggregate (multidimensional scaling) analyses of plant community composition revealed that Phragmites dominance in developed salt marshes resulted in an almost three-fold decrease in plant species richness. Our findings illustrate the importance of maintaining integrity of habitat borders in conserving natural communities and provide an example of the critical role that local conservation can play in preserving these systems. In addition, our findings provide ecologists and natural resource managers with a mechanistic understanding of how human habitat alteration in one vegetation community can interact with species introductions in adjacent communities (i.e., flow-on or adjacency effects) to hasten ecosystem degradation.},

	abstract = {Summary 1. We examined the effects of habitat fragmentation caused by dams on freshwater fish species using a database of 7848 fish presence/absence surveys, conducted between 1953–2003 in Hokkaido, Japan. 2. A series of generalised linear models showed that for 11 of 41 taxa examined, the probability of occurrence had been influenced either negatively (eight taxa) or positively (three taxa) by the presence of a dam downstream from their habitat. 3. Maps of modelled predictions revealed that dams had had widespread negative impacts on certain taxa, while for other taxa the impact was limited to specific basins. Two of the three taxa whose probability of occurrence was increased in areas above dams have long been transplanted into reservoirs in Japan. 4. For four of the eight taxa whose probability of occurrence was reduced above dams and all three taxa whose probability of occurrence increased above dams, the temporal length of habitat isolation (i.e. the number of years between dam construction and sampling) was also a significant predictor of the probability of occurrence. This pattern indicates that these taxa experienced a gradual rather than an instantaneous population impact as a result of dam construction. 5. The eight taxa whose probability of occurrence was reduced as a consequence of dams all exhibit migratory life cycles. Although migratory taxa are probably more susceptible to the negative effect of dams, we could not detect significant relationships between migration life histories and the effect of fragmentation by dams. 6. These analyses enable stream and fisheries managers to quantify the impacts of habitat fragmentation because of dams for individual species. The spatially explicit nature of our analyses also enables identification of the areas of the impact at broad geographical scales. Using our results, managers can take effective conservation and restoration measures to predict, mitigate or remove the impact of dams. For example, our results can be used to prioritise dams for removal or to predict losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services in advance of dam construction.},

Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of thep value procedure. In particular,p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover,p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews thesep value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to thesep value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

	abstract = {Species expanding into new habitats as a result of climate change or human introductions will frequently encounter resident competitors. Theoretical models suggest that such interspecific competition can alter the speed of expansion and the shape of expanding range boundaries. However, competitive interactions are rarely considered when forecasting the success or speed of expansion, in part because there has been no direct experimental evidence that competition affects either expansion speed or boundary shape. Here we demonstrate that interspecific competition alters both expansion speed and range boundary shape. Using a two-species experimental system of the flour beetles
              Tribolium castaneum
              and
              Tribolium confusum
              , we show that interspecific competition dramatically slows expansion across a landscape over multiple generations. Using a parameterized stochastic model of expansion, we find that this slowdown can persist over the long term. We also find that the shape of the moving range boundary changes continuously over many generations of expansion, first steepening and then becoming shallower, due to the competitive effect of the resident and density-dependent dispersal of the invader. This dynamic boundary shape suggests that current forecasting approaches assuming a constant shape could be misleading. More broadly, our results demonstrate that interactions between competing species can play a large role during range expansions and thus should be included in models and studies that monitor, forecast, or manage expansions in natural systems.},

Human disturbance is rapidly altering the spatial and temporal niches of animals, but the impact of humans on resource consumption and partitioning—arguably the most important niche axis—is poorly understood. We assessed resource consumption and trophic niche partitioning as a function of human disturbance at the individual, population, and community levels using stable isotope analysis of 684 carnivores from seven communities in North America. We detected significant responses to human disturbance at all three levels of biological organization: individual carnivores consumed more human food subsidies in disturbed landscapes, leading to significant increases in trophic niche width and trophic niche overlap among species ranging from mesocarnivores to apex predators. Trophic niche partitioning is the primary mechanism regulating coexistence in many communities, and our results indicate that humans fundamentally alter resource niches and competitive interactions among terrestrial consumers. Among carnivores, niche overlap can trigger interspecific competition and intraguild predation, while the consumption of human foods significantly increases human–carnivore conflict. Our results suggest that human disturbances, especially in the form of food subsidies, may threaten carnivores by increasing the probability of both interspecific competition and human–carnivore conflict. Ultimately, these findings illustrate a potential decoupling of predator–prey dynamics, with impacts likely cascading to populations, communities, and ecosystems.},

In forested stream sites allochthonous resources fuel food webs, whereas autochthonous resources support biomass in grassland (open-canopy) stream sites. However, some studies suggest that autochthonous carbon (of highest quality) is preferentially assimilated regardless of riparian cover and that the food-chain length (FCL) may be larger in grassland than in forested sites. We used stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in adjacent grassland and forested reaches to compare the contribution of autochthonous vs. allochthonous resources to the biomass of the whole macroinvertebrate assemblage and to the most abundant taxa. Moreover, we compared the FCL between forested and grassland sites by estimating the trophic position of brown trout, Salmo trutta. Autochthonous support to macroinvertebrate biomass was higher in grassland than in forested sites, often changing from a dominantly autochthonous to an allochthonous-generated biomass from grassland to forested. This held true for the whole macroinvertebrate assemblage and for specific species. FCL remained similar between reach types. Our study suggests that autochthonous resources are assimilated to a higher extent when their availability increases with canopy openness but allochthonous carbon sustain macroinvertebrate biomass in forested reaches.},

We studied the propensity for ballooning dispersal in spiders under standardized laboratory conditions. The 1269 tested individuals belonged to 124 species and originated from 16 sites with wide variation in habitat type. Spiders from disturbed habitats ballooned 5.5 times more than spiders from stable habitats. In Meioneta rurestris , for which we had enough data for a single-species analysis, individuals were most dispersive if they originated from highly disturbed habitats. While the data for the other species were not sufficient for single-species analyses, a hierarchical model that included the data simultaneously on all species suggested that dispersal propensity generally increases within species with the level of habitat disturbance. Dispersal probability showed a trend to increase with niche width, but the higher commonness of species with wide niches provides an alternative explanation for this pattern. As the prevalence of especially dispersive species was highest in disturbed habitats, variation in dispersal propensity was influenced by both inter- and intraspecific factors. We conclude that the positive correlation between niche width and dispersal propensity enables generalist species to utilize highly disturbed habitats, whereas the persistence of specialist species with restricted dispersal ability requires the conservation of stable habitats.},

	abstract = {Climate warming affects the phenology, local abundance and large-scale distribution of plants and pollinators. Despite this, there is still limited knowledge of how elevated temperatures affect plant-pollinator mutualisms and how changed availability of mutualistic partners influences the persistence of interacting species. Here we review the evidence of climate warming effects on plants and pollinators and discuss how their interactions may be affected by increased temperatures. The onset of flowering in plants and first appearance dates of pollinators in several cases appear to advance linearly in response to recent temperature increases. Phenological responses to climate warming may therefore occur at parallel magnitudes in plants and pollinators, although considerable variation in responses across species should be expected. Despite the overall similarities in responses, a few studies have shown that climate warming may generate temporal mismatches among the mutualistic partners. Mismatches in pollination interactions are still rarely explored and their demographic consequences are largely unknown. Studies on multi-species plant-pollinator assemblages indicate that the overall structure of pollination networks probably are robust against perturbations caused by climate warming. We suggest potential ways of studying warming-caused mismatches and their consequences for plant-pollinator interactions, and highlight the strengths and limitations of such approaches.},

	abstract = {Within a metacommunity, both environmental and spatial processes regulate variation in local community structure. The strength of these processes may vary depending on species traits (e.g., dispersal mode) or the characteristics of the regions studied (e.g., spatial extent, environmental heterogeneity). We studied the metacommunity structuring of three groups of stream macroinvertebrates differing in their overland dispersal mode (passive dispersers with aquatic adults; passive dispersers with terrestrial adults; active dispersers with terrestrial adults). We predicted that environmental structuring should be more important for active dispersers, because of their better ability to track environmental variability, and that spatial structuring should be more important for species with aquatic adults, because of stronger dispersal limitation. We sampled a total of 70 stream riffle sites in three drainage basins. Environmental heterogeneity was unrelated to spatial extent among our study regions, allowing us to examine the effects of these two factors on metacommunity structuring. We used partial redundancy analysis and Moran's eigenvector maps based on overland and watercourse distances to study the relative importance of environmental control and spatial structuring. We found that, compared with environmental control, spatial structuring was generally negligible, and it did not vary according to our predictions. In general, active dispersers with terrestrial adults showed stronger environmental control than the two passively dispersing groups, suggesting that the species dispersing actively are better able to track environmental variability. There were no clear differences in the results based on watercourse and overland distances. The variability in metacommunity structuring among basins was not related to the differences in the environmental heterogeneity and spatial extent. Our study emphasized that (1) environmental control is prevailing in stream metacommunities, (2) dispersal mode may have an important effect on metacommunity structuring, and (3) some factors other than spatial extent or environmental heterogeneity contributed to the differences among the basins.},

Experimental work has demonstrated the impact of species interactions on the species involved, but it remains unclear whether these effects can also be detected in long-term time series across heterogeneous landscapes. We analyzed a 19-year time series of patch occupancy by the Glanville fritillary butterfly Melitaea cinxia, its specialist parasitoid wasp Cotesia melitaearum, and the specialist fungal pathogen Podosphaera plantaginis infecting Plantago lanceolata, a host plant of the Glanville fritillary. These species share a network of more than 4,000 habitat patches in the Åland islands, providing a metacommunity data set of unique spatial and temporal resolution. To assess the influence of interactions among the butterfly, parasitoid, and mildew on metacommunity dynamics, we modeled local colonization and extinction rates of each species while including or excluding the presence of potentially interacting species in the previous year as predictors. The metapopulation dynamics of all focal species varied both along a gradient in host plant abundance, and spatially as indicated by strong effects of local connectivity. Colonization and to a lesser extent extinction rates depended also on the presence of interacting species within patches. However, the directions of most effects differed from expectations based on previous experimental and modeling work, and the inferred influence of species interactions on observed metacommunity dynamics was limited. These results suggest that although local interactions among the butterfly, parasitoid, and mildew occur, their roles in metacommunity spatiotemporal dynamics are relatively weak. Instead, all species respond to variation in plant abundance, which may in turn fluctuate in response to variation in climate, land use, or other environmental factors.},

As a result, interactions between species can become disrupted, with potentially detrimental effects. Predicting these consequences has proven challenging. We apply structured population models to a well-characterised great tit-caterpillar model system and identify thresholds of temporal asynchrony, beyond which the predator population will rapidly go extinct. Our model suggests that phenotypic plasticity in predator breeding timing initially maintains temporal synchrony in the face of environmental change. However, under projections of climate change, predator plasticity was insufficient to keep pace with prey phenology. Directional evolution then accelerated, but could not prevent mismatch. Once predator phenology lagged behind prey by more than 24 days, rapid extinction was inevitable, despite previously stable population dynamics. Our projections suggest that current population stability could be masking a route to population collapse, if high greenhouse gas emissions continue.},

For almost 50 years, we have been able to remotely sense key water quality constituents like total suspended sediment, dissolved organic carbon, chlorophyll a, and Secchi disk depth. Nonetheless, remote sensing of water quality is poorly integrated into inland water sciences, in part due to a lack of publicly available training data and a perception that remote estimates are unreliable. Remote sensing models of water quality can be improved by training and validation on larger data sets of coincident field and satellite observations, here called matchups. To facilitate model development and deeper integration of remote sensing into inland water science, we have built AquaSat, the largest such matchup data set ever assembled. AquaSat contains more than 600,000 matchups, covering 1984–2019, of ground-based total suspended sediment, dissolved organic carbon, chlorophyll a, and SDDSecchi disk depth measurements paired with spectral reflectance from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 collected within ±1 day of each other. To build AquaSat, we developed open source tools in R and Python and applied them to existing public data sets covering the contiguous United States, including the Water Quality Portal, LAGOS-NE, and the Landsat archive. In addition to publishing the data set, we are also publishing our full code architecture to facilitate expanding and improving AquaSat. We anticipate that this work will help make remote sensing of inland water accessible to more hydrologists, ecologists, and limnologists while facilitating novel data-driven approaches to monitoring and understanding critical water resources at large spatiotemporal scales.},

	abstract = {Abstract Where inter-specific facilitation favors the establishment of high densities of a beneficiary species, strong intra-specific competition may subsequently impede beneficiary performance. Consequently, the negative influence of intra-specific competition between beneficiary individuals could potentially outweigh the positive influence of inter-specific facilitation when, for example, higher densities of a beneficiary are negated by the negative effect of crowding on beneficiary reproduction. The aim of this study was, therefore, to examine the impact of an inter-specific interaction on the outcome of intra-specific interactions within the context of plant-plant facilitation. We used the cushion-forming Azorella selago and a commonly co-occurring dominant perennial grass species, Agrostis magellanica, on sub-Antarctic Marion Island as a model system. We assessed the impact of an inter-specific interaction (between A. selago and A. magellanica) on the outcome of intra-specific interactions (between A. magellanica individuals), by testing if the impact of A. magellanica density on A. magellanica performance is mediated by its interaction with A. selago. We observed evidence for competition among A. magellanica conspecifics, with a decreasing proportion of A. magellanica individuals being reproductive under higher conspecific density. This negative intra-specific effect was greater on A. selago than on the adjacent substrate, suggesting that the facilitative effect of A. selago changes the intensity of intra-specific interactions between A. magellanica individuals. However, experimentally reducing A. magellanica density did not affect the species’ performance. We also observed that the effect of A. selago on A. magellanica was positive, and despite the negative effect of intra-specific density on the proportion of reproductive A. magellanica individuals, the net reproductive effort of A. magellanica (i.e. the density of reproductive individuals) was significantly greater on A. selago than on the adjacent substrate. These results highlight that, in abiotically-severe environments, the positive effects of inter-specific facilitation by a benefactor species may outweigh the negative effects of intra-specific competition among beneficiaries. More broadly, these results suggest that both positive inter- and intra-specific biotic interactions may be key to consider when examining spatial and temporal variation in species’ performance.},

We trained soils with five individually grown native species and used amplicon sequencing to analyze the resulting bacterial and fungal soil communities. We mixed the soils to create trained soils from one, two or four native species. We then grew four alien species separately on these differently trained soils. In the soil-conditioning phase, the five native species built species-specific bacterial and fungal communities in their rhizospheres. In the test phase, it did not matter for biomass of alien plants whether the soil had been trained by one or two native species. However, the alien species achieved 11.7\% (95\% CI: 3.7–20.1\%) less aboveground biomass when grown on soils trained by four native species than on soils trained by two native species. Our results revealed soil-microbes-mediated apparent competition as a mechanism underlying the negative relationship between diversity and invasibility.},

	abstract = {Movement behavior is an essential element of fundamental ecological processes such as competition and predation. Although intraspecific trait variation (ITV) in movement behaviors is pervasive, its consequences for ecological community dynamics are still not fully understood. Using a newly developed individual-based model, we analyzed how given and constant ITVs in foraging movement affect differences in foraging efficiencies between species competing for common resources under various resource distributions. Further, we analyzed how the effect of ITV on emerging differences in competitive abilities ultimately affects species coexistence. The model is generic but mimics observed patterns of among-individual covariation between personality, movement and space use in ground-dwelling rodents. Interacting species differed in their mean behavioral types along a slow–fast continuum, integrating consistent individual variation in average behavioral expression and responsiveness (i.e. behavioral reaction norms). We found that ITV reduced interspecific differences in competitive abilities by 5–35\% and thereby promoted coexistence via an equalizing mechanism. The emergent relationships between behavioral types and foraging efficiency are characteristic for specific environmental contexts of resource distribution and population density. As these relationships are asymmetric, species that were either ‘too fast’ or ‘too slow’ benefited differently from ITV. Thus, ITV in movement behavior has consequences for species coexistence but to predict its effect in a given system requires intimate knowledge on how variation in movement traits relates to fitness components along an environmental gradient.},

However, the accurate description of food webs requires significant effort in time and resources, limiting their widespread use in ecological studies. Newly published methods allow for the inference of feeding interactions using proxy variables. Here, we compare the accuracy of two recently described methods, as well as describe a composite model of the two, for the inference of feeding interactions using a large, well-described dataset. Both niche and neutral processes are involved in determining whether or not two species will form a feeding link in communities. Three different models for determining niche constraints of feeding interactions are compared, and all three models are extended by incorporating neutral processes, based on relative abundances. The three models compared here infer niche processes through (a) phylogenetic relationships, (b) local species trait distributions (e.g., body size), and (c) a composite of phylogeny and local traits. We show that all three methods perform well at predicting individual species interactions, and that these individual predictions scale up to the network level, resulting in food web structure of inferred networks being similar to their empirical counterparts. Our results indicate that inferring food web structure using phylogenies can be an efficient way of getting summary webs with minimal data, and offers a conservative test of changes in food web structure, particularly when there is low species turnover between sites. Inferences made using traits require more data, but allows for greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying trophic interactions. A composite model of the two methods provides a framework for investigating the importance of how phylogeny, trait distributions, and relative abundances, affect species interactions, and network structure.},

More specifically, we consider evolutionary responses in host species involved in different types of interaction, that is parasitism or commensalism, and for low or high costs of a temperature tolerance–fertility trade-off (cost of generalization). We find that host species potentially evolve all three traits simultaneously in response to increasing temperature but that the evolutionary response interacts and may be compensatory depending on the conditions. The evolutionary adjustment of temperature preference is slower in the parasitism than in commensalism scenario. Parasitism, in turn, selects for higher temperature tolerance and increased dispersal. High costs for temperature tolerance (i.e. generalization) restrict evolution of tolerance and thus lead to a faster response in temperature preference than that observed under low costs. These results emphasize the possible role of biotic interactions and the importance of ‘multidimensional’ evolutionary responses to climate change.},

Data were retrieved from a Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) database. The scaling relationships were established with ordinary least square (OLS) and standard major axis (SMA) regressions. The focus was on the SMA regressions because this method provides better estimates of the slope. The overall empirical regressions derived were highly significant (p {\textless} 0.01). Average discharge (Q) and maximum discharge (Qmax) scaled to catchment area (A) with SMA slopes of 1.23 (r2 = 0.40) and 0.99 (r2 = 0.41), respectively. Average discharge (Q) scaled to length (L) with a slope of 2.16 (r2 = 0.40), while catchment area (A) scaled to main-stem length (L) with a slope of 1.76 (r2 = 0.91). The addition of precipitation (P), yielding a multiple regression of discharge versus catchment area and precipitation, improved the explained variability to r2 = 0.56 and r2 = 0.52 for average and maximum discharge, respectively. Slopes of climate zone-specific regressions tended to be similar to the slopes of the overall relationships.

We briefly review the conceptual background of Hill numbers along with two approaches to standardization. We present an R package iNEXT (iNterpolation/EXTrapolation) which provides simple functions to compute and plot the seamless rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves for the three most widely used members of the Hill number family (species richness, Shannon diversity and Simpson diversity). Two types of biodiversity data are allowed: individual-based abundance data and sampling-unit-based incidence data.

The Canadian government closed the directed fishing for northern cod in July 1992, but even after a decade-long offshore moratorium, population sizes remain historically low4. Here we show that, up until the moratorium, the life history of northern cod continually shifted towards maturation at earlier ages and smaller sizes. Because confounding effects of mortality changes and growth-mediated phenotypic plasticity are accounted for in our analyses, this finding strongly suggests fisheries-induced evolution of maturation patterns in the direction predicted by theory5,6.

Based on sample species abundance or replicated incidence records from each of the N communities, we derive in this article a nonparametric approach to constructing a lower bound for the number of species shared by N (N≥2) communities. The approach is valid for all types of species abundance distributions (for abundance data) or species detection probabilities (for replicated incidence data). Variance estimators for the proposed lower bounds are obtained by using typical asymptotic theory. Simulation results are reported to examine the performance of the lower bounds. Replicated incidence data of ciliate species collected in three areas from Namibia, southwest Africa, are used for illustration.

Analyses have focused on variations in the log abundances of species, with mean logarithmic growth rates when rare, Er, used as metrics for persistence. However, invasion probabilities and the times to extinction are not single-valued functions of Er and, in some cases, decrease as Er increases. Here, we present a synthesis of stochasticity-induced stabilization (SIS) phenomena based on the ratio between the expected arithmetic growth μ and its variance g. When the diffusion approximation holds, explicit formulas for invasion probabilities and persistence times are single-valued, monotonic functions of μ/g. The storage effect in the lottery model, together with other well-known examples drawn from population genetics, microbiology, and ecology (including discrete and continuous dynamics, with overlapping and non-overlapping generations), are placed together, reviewed, and explained within this new, transparent theoretical framework. We also clarify the relationships between life-history strategies and SIS, and study the dynamics of extinction when SIS fails.},

Assuming that (i) available space restricts predator body size, (ii) mass-specific energy needs of predators scale with their body size, and (iii) energy availability scales with prey biomass, we predicted that predator biomass per unit area would scale with habitat size (quarter-power exponent) and prey biomass (three-quarter–power exponent). We found that total predator biomass scaled with habitat size and prey resources as expected across 29 New Zealand rivers, such that a unit of habitat in a small ecosystem supported less predator biomass than an equivalent unit in a large ecosystem. The lower energetic costs of large body size likely mean that a unit of prey resource supports more biomass of large-bodied predators compared to small-bodied predators. Thus, contracting habitat size reduces the predator mass that can be supported because of constraints on predator body size, and this may be a powerful mechanism exacerbating reductions in biodiversity due to habitat loss.},

	abstract = {In the face of ongoing global climate and land use change, organisms have multiple possibilities to cope with the modification of their environment. The two main possibilities are to either adapt locally or disperse to a more suitable habitat. The evolution of both local adaptation and dispersal interacts and can be influenced by the spatial and temporal variation (of e.g. temperature or precipitation). In an individual based model (IBM), we explore evolution of phenotypes in landscapes with varying degree of spatial relative to global temporal variation in order to examine its influence on the evolution of dispersal, niche optimum and niche width. The relationship between temporal and spatial variation did neither influence the evolution of local adaptation in the niche optimum nor of niche widths. Dispersal probability is highly influenced by the spatio-temporal relationship: with increasing spatial variation, dispersal probability decreases. Additionally, the shape of the distribution of the trait values over patch attributes switches from hump- to U-shaped. At low spatial variance more individuals emigrate from average habitats, at high spatial variance more from extreme habitats. The comparatively high dispersal probability in extreme patches of landscapes with a high spatial variation can be explained by evolutionary succession of two kinds of adaptive response. Early in the simulations, extreme patches in landscapes with a high spatial variability act as sink habitats, where population persistence depends on highly dispersive individuals with a wide niche. With ongoing evolution, local adaptation of the remaining individuals takes over, but simultaneously a possible bet-hedging strategy promotes higher dispersal probabilities in those habitats. Here, in generations that experience extreme shifts from the temporal mean of the patch attribute, the expected fitness becomes higher for dispersing individuals than for philopatric individuals. This means that under certain circumstances, both local adaptation and high dispersal probability can be selected for for coping with the projected environmental changes in the future.},

Here, we provide examples from published research demonstrating the importance of year effects during community assembly across study systems. We further quantify these year effects with two case studies—a grassland restoration experiment and a study of postfire conifer recruitment—finding that the effects of initiation year on community composition can dictate community as much, if not more, than the effects of experimental treatments or site. The evidence strongly suggests that year effects are pervasive and profound, and that year effects early in community assembly can drive strong and enduring divergence in community structure and function. Explicit attention to year effects in ecological research serves to illuminate basic ecological principles, allowing for better understanding of contingencies in ecology. These dynamics also have strong implications for applied ecological research, offering new insights into ecological restoration as well as future climate change.},

Generalizable tests of these hypotheses have been limited by heterogeneous sampling designs and a narrow focus on estimates of species richness that are strongly dependent on scale. Here we analyse 123 studies of assemblage-level abundances of focal taxa taken from multiple habitat fragments of varying size to evaluate the influence of passive sampling and ecosystem decay on biodiversity loss. We found overall support for the ecosystem decay hypothesis. Across all studies, ecosystems and taxa, biodiversity estimates from smaller habitat fragments—when controlled for sampling effort—contain fewer individuals, fewer species and less-even communities than expected from a sample of larger fragments. However, the diversity loss due to ecosystem decay in some studies (for example, those in which habitat loss took place more than 100 years ago) was less than expected from the overall pattern, as a result of compositional turnover by species that were not originally present in the intact habitats. We conclude that the incorporation of non-passive effects of habitat loss on biodiversity change will improve biodiversity scenarios under future land use, and planning for habitat protection and restoration.},

We show how this new approach allows us to estimate a probability of persistence for single species in local communities; to understand and interpret this probability conditional on the information we have concerning a system; and to provide out-of-sample predictions of species persistence as good as the best experimental approaches without the need of extensive amounts of data.},

	abstract = {Stable isotopes are increasingly being used as tracers in environmental studies. One application is to use isotopic ratios to quantitatively determine the proportional contribution of several sources to a mixture, such as the proportion of various pollution sources in a waste stream. In general, the proportional contributions of n+1 different sources can be uniquely determined by the use of n different isotope system tracers (e.g., δ13C, δ15N, δ18O) with linear mixing models based on mass balance equations. Often, however, the number of potential sources exceeds n+1, which prevents finding a unique solution of source proportions. What can be done in these situations? While no definitive solution exists, we propose a method that is informative in determining bounds for the contributions of each source. In this method, all possible combinations of each source contribution (0–100\%) are examined in small increments (e.g., 1\%). Combinations that sum to the observed mixture isotopic signatures within a small tolerance (e.g., ±0.1‰) are considered to be feasible solutions, from which the frequency and range of potential source contributions can be determined. To avoid misrepresenting the results, users of this procedure should report the distribution of feasible solutions rather than focusing on a single value such as the mean. We applied this method to a variety of environmental studies in which stable isotope tracers were used to quantify the relative magnitude of multiple sources, including (1) plant water use, (2) geochemistry, (3) air pollution, and (4) dietary analysis. This method gives the range of isotopically determined source contributions; additional non-isotopic constraints specific to each study may be used to further restrict this range. The breadth of the isotopically determined ranges depends on the geometry of the mixing space and the similarity of source and mixture isotopic signatures. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the estimated ranges vary only modestly with different choices of source increment and mass balance tolerance parameter values. A computer program (IsoSource) to perform these calculations for user-specified data is available at http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/models.htm.},

Many ecosystem functions are measured only at local scales, while their effects occur at a landscape level. Here we investigate how landscape-scale predictions of ecosystem function depend on intraspecific competition, a fine-scale process, by manipulating intraspecific density of shredding macroinvertebrates and examining effects on leaf litter decomposition, a key function in freshwater ecosystems. For two species, we found that per capita leaf processing rates declined with increasing density following power functions with negative exponents, likely due to interference competition. To demonstrate consequences of this nonlinearity, we scaled up estimates of leaf litter processing from shredder abundance surveys in 10 replicated headwater streams. In accordance with Jensen?s inequality, applying density-dependent consumption rates reduced estimates of catchment-scale leaf consumption by an order of magnitude relative to density-independent rates. Density-dependent consumption estimates aligned closely with metabolic requirements in catchments with large?but not small?shredder populations. Importantly, shredder abundance was not limited by leaf litter availability, and catchment-level leaf litter supply was much higher than estimated consumption. Thus leaf litter processing was not limited by resource supply. Our work highlights the need for scaling up, which accounts for intraspecific interactions.},

To obtain a more nuanced understanding of trophic control over large scales, we explored long-term time-series data from 13 globally distributed lakes and used empirical dynamic modelling to quantify interaction strengths between zooplankton and phytoplankton over time within and across lakes. Across all lakes, top-down effects were associated with nutrients, switching from negative in mesotrophic lakes to positive in oligotrophic lakes. This result suggests that zooplankton nutrient recycling exceeds grazing pressure in nutrient-limited systems. Within individual lakes, results were consistent with a ‘seasonal reset’ hypothesis in which top-down and bottom-up interactions varied seasonally and were both strongest at the beginning of the growing season. Thus, trophic control is not static, but varies with abiotic conditions – dynamics that only become evident when observing changes over large spatial and temporal scales.},

However, while there is general consensus on the scale-dependent and interacting nature of ecological processes, there is limited knowledge about the relative importance of CNDD across spatial scales and on its interaction with other processes, such as dispersal and immigration. While many studies have detected CNDD at local scales, it remains unknown whether its effects on biodiversity maintenance scale-up to landscapes and regions. Here, we use a generic dynamic and spatially-explicit simulation model to assess the interacting relative effects of local-scale CNDD and immigration from a metacommunity for biodiversity maintenance across spatial scales. For this purpose, we systematically varied immigration rates, the average strength and the variation of CNDD among species. We found that CNDD only determined species richness in strongly isolated communities with little or no interspecific variation in CNDD. In closed communities, plausible interspecific variation in CNDD led to a strong reduction in species richness. In open communities, realistic levels of immigration overwhelmed the effects of CNDD on diversity maintenance. From these results, we suggest that local CNDD is unlikely to be a main driver of biodiversity in real communities, especially at larger spatial scales. This study provides a first step towards improved integration of local-scale coexistence theory with large-scale metacommunity theory and highlights the importance of considering the interacting and scale-dependent nature of ecological processes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Identifying the drivers of population fluctuations in spatially distinct populations remains a significant challenge for ecologists. Whereas regional climatic factors may generate population synchrony (i.e. the Moran effect), local factors including the level of density dependence may reduce the level of synchrony. Although divergences in the scaling of population synchrony and spatial environmental variation have been observed, the regulatory factors that underlie such mismatches are poorly understood. Few previous studies have investigated how density-dependent processes and population-specific responses to weather variation influence spatial synchrony at both local and regional scales. We addressed this issue in a pond-breeding amphibian, the great crested newt Triturus cristatus. We used capture–recapture data collected through long-term surveys in five T. cristatus populations in Western Europe. In all populations—and subpopulations within metapopulations—population size, annual survival and recruitment fluctuated over time. Likewise, there was considerable variation in these demographic rates between populations and within metapopulations. These fluctuations and variations appear to be context-dependent and more related to site-specific characteristics than local or regional climatic drivers. We found a low level of demographic synchrony at both local and regional levels. Weather has weak and spatially variable effects on survival, recruitment and population growth rate. In contrast, density dependence was a common phenomenon (at least for population growth) in almost all populations and subpopulations. Our findings support the idea that the Moran effect is low in species where the population dynamics more closely depends on local factors (e.g. population density and habitat characteristics) than on large-scale environmental fluctuation (e.g. regional climatic variation). Such responses may have far-reaching consequences for the long-term viability of spatially structured populations and their ability to respond to large-scale climatic anomalies.},

	abstract = {Abstract Competition is a widespread interaction among carnivores, ultimately manifested through one or more dimensions of the species' ecological niche. One of the most explicit manifestations of competitive interactions regards spatial displacement. Its interpretation under a theoretical context provides an important tool to deepen our understanding of biological systems and communities, but also for wildlife management and conservation. We used Bayesian multispecies occupancy models on camera-trapping data from multiple sites in Southwestern Europe (SWE) to investigate competitive interactions within a carnivore guild, and to evaluate how species' ecological traits are shaping coexistence patterns. Seventeen out of 26 pairwise interactions departed from a hypothesis of independent occurrence, with spatial association being twice as frequent as avoidance. Association behaviors were only detected among mesocarnivores, while avoidance mainly involved mesocarnivores avoiding the apex predator (n = 4) and mesocarnivore-only interactions (n = 2). Body mass ratios, defined as the dominant over the subordinate species body mass, revealed an important negative effect ( β{\textasciicircum}=-0.38;CI95=-0.81to-0.06) on co-occurrence probability, and support that spatially explicit competitive interactions are mostly expressed by larger species able to dominate over smaller ones, with a threshold in body mass ratios of {\textasciitilde}4, above which local-scale intraguild coexistence is unlikely. We found a weak relationship between pairwise trophic niche overlap and the probability of coexistence ( β{\textasciicircum}=-0.19;CI95=-0.58to0.21), suggesting that competition for feeding resources may not be a key driver of competition, at least at the scale of our analysis. Despite local-scale avoidance, regional-scale coexistence appears to be maintained by the spatial structuring of the competitive environment. We provide evidence that SWE ecosystems consist of spatially structured competitive environments, and propose that coexistence among near-sized species is likely achieved through the interplay of “facultative” and “behavioral” character displacements. Factors influencing carnivore coexistence likely include context-dependent density and trait-mediated effects, which should be carefully considered for a sound understanding of the mechanisms regulating these communities.},

Anguillid eels were the widest topographically-distributed species ranging from near the mouth to the upper reaches of rivers. Moreover, stable isotopic analyses indicated that eels are likely one of the highest-order predators in freshwater ecosystems. A significant positive relationship was found between the density of eels and the number of other diadromous species collected. However, the optimal models revealed that both the density of eels and the number of other diadromous species were significantly negatively correlated with distance from the river mouth and cumulative height of trans-river structures from the river mouth to each site. This suggests the positive relationship between eel density and number of other diadromous species was indirect and related to river-ocean connectivity.

The complexity of ecological data often suggests implementation of (statistical) models with a commensurately rich structure of effects, including crossed or nested (i.e., hierarchical or multi-level) structures of fixed and/or random effects. Yet, our experience suggests that most ecologists are not familiar with subtle but important problems that often arise with such models and with their implementation in popular software. Of foremost consideration for us is the notion of effect identifiability, which generally concerns how well data, models, or implementation approaches inform about, i.e., identify, quantities of interest. In this paper, we focus on implementation pitfalls that potentially misinform subsequent inference, despite otherwise informative data and models. We illustrate the aforementioned issues using random effects regressions on synthetic data. We show how to diagnose identifiability issues and how to remediate these issues with model reparameterization and computational and/or coding practices in popular software, with a focus on JAGS, OpenBUGS, and Stan. We also show how these solutions can be extended to more complex models involving multiple groups of nested, crossed, additive, or multiplicative effects, for models involving random and/or fixed effects.

But steep environmental gradients may be nested within larger-scale, regional conditions that could influence these processes at the local scale. Therefore, we hypothesized that phenotypic differentiation along a steep environmental gradient would vary among regions. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment on rocky intertidal shores, a habitat characterized by gradients in abiotic and biotic stress, in three regions of the Gulf of Maine. We used the ubiquitous and ecologically important rockweed species Fucus vesiculosus to quantify differentiation in growth, tissue nitrogen, and nitrogen productivity between upper and lower intertidal individuals. We found that phenotypic differentiation between tide heights varied among traits and regions. Although tissue nitrogen did not vary among any treatment combinations, growth and nitrogen productivity response were region specific. A strong effect of transplant height was found in all regions; however, an effect of home (source) height was only detectable in the central Gulf of Maine. Our study reveals that intraspecific responses to steep environmental gradients vary among populations, but the mechanisms underlying these patterns remain unknown.

We hypothesized that multiple mechanisms might cause trophic niche ‘compression’, as indicated by changes in realized trophic roles. Food-web properties based on consumer stable isotope data (δ13C and δ15N) showed that increasing sediment disturbance was associated with reduced trophic diversity. In particular, the aquatic invertebrate community occupied a smaller area in isotopic niche space along the sedimentation gradient that was best explained by a narrowing of the invertebrate community δ13C range. Decreased niche partitioning, driven by increasing habitat homogeneity, environmental filtering and resource scarcity all seemingly lead to greater trophic equivalency caused by the collapse of the autochthonous food-web channel. Bayesian mixing-model analyses supported this contention with invertebrate consumers increasingly reliant on detritus along the sedimentation gradient, and predatory invertebrates relying more on the prey using these basal resources. The narrowing of the fish community δ13C range along the sedimentation gradient contributed to an apparent ‘trophic shift’ towards terrestrial carbon, further indicating the loss of the autochthonous food-web channel. On the vertical trophic niche axis, fish became increasingly separated from aquatic invertebrates with an increase in their estimated trophic position. In combination, these responses were most likely mediated through reduced fish densities and a diminished reliance on aquatic prey. Although species losses remain a major threat to ecosystem integrity, the functional roles of biota that persist dictate how food webs and ecosystem functioning respond to environmental change. Sedimentation was associated with nonlinear reductions in trophic diversity which could affect the functioning and stability of aquatic ecosystems. Our study helps explain how multiple mechanisms may radically reshape food-web properties in response to this type of disturbance.},

	abstract = {Abstract In the USA, the Topeka shiner (Notropis topeka) is a federally listed endangered species that has been in decline for decades. A key reason for the decline is the alteration of naturally flowing streams and associated oxbow habitats resulting from land-use changes. The focus of recent conservation efforts for Topeka shiners has been the restoration of oxbow habitats by removing sediment from natural oxbows until a groundwater connection is re-established. This restoration practice has become common in portions of Iowa and south-west Minnesota. The goals of this study were to compare the occurrence and abundance of Topeka shiners in restored and unrestored oxbows and to determine the characteristics that influenced their presence in these systems. In 2016–2017, 34 unrestored and 64 restored oxbows in the Boone, Beaver Creek, North Raccoon and Rock River basins in Iowa and Minnesota were sampled for their fish assemblages and abiotic features. Topeka shiners were present more often and with higher average relative abundances in restored oxbows. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordinations indicated that fish assemblages found in oxbows where Topeka shiners were present were less variable than assemblages found at oxbows where they were absent, but that abiotic characteristics were similar between oxbow types. Logistic regression models suggested that the presence of Topeka shiners in oxbows was positively associated with species richness, brassy minnow (Hybognathus hankinsoni) catch per unit effort (no. fish/100 m2; CPUE), orangespotted sunfish (Lepomis humilis) CPUE, dissolved oxygen and turbidity, and negatively associated with oxbow wetted length. These results highlight the use of restored oxbows by Topeka shiners while also providing new information to help guide restoration and conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {The production and transfer of biomass through trophic relationships is a core ecosystem function. The movement of energy through the food web is mediated by organisms operating in their niche space. For generalists, the size of this niche space is inherently plastic and changes in response to available food sources. Therefore, this relationship between ecosystem productivity and niche size is an important determinant of ecosystem function. Competing theories about the nature of this relationship predict that as productivity increases niche size will either increase as species capitalize on a general increase in resource availability or decrease as it becomes viable to focus on preferred production channels. Here, we test these two competing theoretical frameworks using a novel approach to determine trophic niche size using stable isotope analysis and hypervolume metrics. Resource use is quantified in two generalist fish species at three productivity levels in a seagrass ecosystem. Niche size of both species was inversely related to seagrass productivity, consistent with the hypothesis that increasing productivity allows species to focus on a narrower diet. This pattern describes the relationship between ecosystem production and niche size and provides an empirical ecological explanation for the resource maximization behaviors commonly observed in nature.},

Habitats are dynamic and vary across both space and time. Such variation can help to facilitate long-term persistence of species by allowing local movement in search of the best conditions. Brennan et al. clearly demonstrate the benefit of the habitat mosaic to Pacific salmon by characterizing how both climate and population productivity vary over time and space in an Alaskan river system.Science, this issue p. 783Watersheds are complex mosaics of habitats whose conditions vary across space and time as landscape features filter overriding climate forcing, yet the extent to which the reliability of ecosystem services depends on these dynamics remains unknown. We quantified how shifting habitat mosaics are expressed across a range of spatial scales within a large, free-flowing river, and how they stabilize the production of Pacific salmon that support valuable fisheries. The strontium isotope records of ear stones (otoliths) show that the relative productivity of locations across the river network, as both natal- and juvenile-rearing habitat, varies widely among years and that this variability is expressed across a broad range of spatial scales, ultimately stabilizing the interannual production of fish at the scale of the entire basin.},

In this paper we use a decision-theory framework to examine a fundamental management question: Should we focus on decreasing the local extinction probability of subpopulations by increasing the size of their patch, or should metapopulation viability be improved by constructing more patches? Using a spatially implicit stochastic metapopulation model and stochastic dynamic programming (SDP), we found the optimal solution to this problem for both the finite- and infinite-time horizon cases. We showed that the SDP solutions outperform a range of heuristic management strategies. The optimal strategy for a given parameter set depends heavily on metapopulation parameters, and it is difficult to make generalizations about the optimal restoration strategy a priori. Although heuristic strategies perform well in some cases, it is not possible to judge their performance until the SDP solution has been computed, and for this reason we advocate the use of SDP as a management tool in restoration. We demonstrate the use of SDP by deriving an optimal management strategy for a population of the Mount Lofty Ranges Southern Emu-wren (Stipiturus malachurus intermedius).},

Our results showed that both controls operated in terrestrial habitats and that their relative importance switched as habitat size changed. Habitat loss initially removed predators of rodents that released rodent populations and triggered massive seed predation (top-down control), leading to reduced seedling establishment. A further reduction in habitat size led to decrease in rodent population that was supposed to increase seedling survival of the tree species, but the decline in habitat size deteriorated the abiotic environments (bottom-up control) that severely prevented seedling recruitment. As the ongoing global land use change is creating increasing number of small-sized forest fragments, our findings provide novel insights into the restoration of seriously fragmented forests.},

	abstract = {Understanding host–pathogen dynamics requires realistic consideration of transmission events that, in the case of directly transmitted pathogens, result from contacts between susceptible and infected individuals. The corresponding contact rates are usually heterogeneous due to variation in individual movement patterns and the underlying landscape structure. However, in epidemiological models, the roles that explicit host movements and landscape structure play in shaping contact rates are often overlooked. We adapted an established agent-based model of classical swine fever (CSF) in wild boar Sus scrofa to investigate how explicit representation of landscape heterogeneity and host movement between social groups affects invasion and persistence probabilities. We simulated individual movement both phenomenologically as a correlated random walk (CRW) and mechanistically by representing interactions of the moving individuals with the landscape and host population structure. The effect of landscape structure on the probability of invasion success and disease persistence depended remarkably on the way host movement is simulated and the case fatality ratio associated with the pathogen strain. The persistence probabilities were generally low with CRW which ignores feedbacks to external factors. Although the basic reproduction number R0, a measure of the contagiousness of an infectious disease, was kept constant, these probabilities were up to eight times higher under mechanistic movement rules, especially in heterogeneous landscapes. The increased persistence emerged due to important feedbacks of the directed movement on the spatial variation of host density, contact rates and transmission events to distant areas. Our findings underscore the importance of accounting for spatial context and group size structures in eco-epidemiological models. Our study highlights that the simulation of explicit, mechanistic movement behaviour can reverse predictions of disease persistence in comparison to phenomenological rules such as random walk approaches. This can have severe consequences when predicting the probability of disease persistence and assessing control measures to prevent outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Abstract Ecological drift can override the effects of deterministic niche selection on small populations and drive the assembly of some ecological communities. We tested this hypothesis with a unique data set sampled identically in 200 streams in two regions (tropical Brazil and boreal Finland) that differ in macroinvertebrate community size by fivefold. Null models allowed us to estimate the magnitude to which β-diversity deviates from the expectation under a random assembly process while taking differences in richness and relative abundance into account, i.e., β-deviation. We found that both abundance- and incidence-based β-diversity was negatively related to community size only in Brazil. Also, β-diversity of small tropical communities was closer to stochastic expectations compared with β-diversity of large communities. We suggest that ecological drift may drive variation in some small communities by changing the expected outcome of niche selection, increasing the chances of species with low abundance and narrow distribution to occur in some communities. Habitat destruction, overexploitation, pollution, and reductions in connectivity have been reducing the size of biological communities. These environmental pressures might make smaller communities more vulnerable to novel conditions and render community dynamics more unpredictable. Incorporation of community size into ecological models should provide conceptual and applied insights into a better understanding of the processes driving biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Abstract To make adaptive foraging decisions, predators need to gather information about the profitability of prey. As well as learning from prey encounters, recent studies show that predators can learn about prey defences by observing the negative foraging experiences of conspecifics. However, predator communities are complex. While observing heterospecifics may increase learning opportunities, we know little about how social information use varies across predator species. Social transmission of avoidance among predators also has potential consequences for defended prey. Conspicuous aposematic prey are assumed to be an easy target for naïve predators, but this cost may be reduced if multiple predators learn by observing single predation events. Heterospecific information use by predators might further benefit aposematic prey, but this remains untested. Here we test conspecific and heterospecific information use across a predator community with wild-caught blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tits (Parus major). We used video playback to manipulate social information about novel aposematic prey and then compared birds’ foraging choices in ‘a small-scale novel world’ that contained novel palatable and aposematic prey items. We expected that blue tits would be less likely to use social information compared to great tits. However, we found that both blue tits and great tits consumed fewer aposematic prey after observing a negative foraging experience of a demonstrator. In fact, this effect was stronger in blue tits compared to great tits. Interestingly, blue tits also learned more efficiently from watching conspecifics, whereas great tits learned similarly regardless of the demonstrator species. Together, our results indicate that social transmission about novel aposematic prey occurs in multiple predator species and across species boundaries. This supports the idea that social interactions among predators can reduce attacks on aposematic prey and therefore influence selection for prey defences.},

We first outline the conditions under which biotic interactions can result in range shifts that proceed faster or slower than climate velocity and result in ecological surprises. Next, we use our own work to demonstrate that experimental studies documenting the strength of biotic interactions across large environmental gradients are a critical first step for understanding whether they will influence climate change–induced range shifts. Further progress could be made by integrating results from these studies into modeling frameworks to predict how or generalize when biotic interactions mediate how changing climates influence range shifts. Finally, we argue that many more case studies like those described here are needed to explore the importance of biotic interactions during climate change–induced range shifts.},

We examined the distribution of orchard species (apples, pears, plums and other top fruits) and their pollinators in Great Britain, for present and future climatic conditions projected for 2050 under the SRES A1B Emissions Scenario. We used a relative index of pollinator availability as a proxy for pollination service. At present, there is a large spatial overlap between orchards and their pollinators, but predictions for 2050 revealed that the most suitable areas for orchards corresponded to low pollinator availability. However, we found that pollinator availability may persist in areas currently used for fruit production, which are predicted to provide suboptimal environmental suitability for orchard species in the future. Our results may be used to identify mitigation options to safeguard orchard production against the risk of pollination failure in Great Britain over the next 50 years; for instance, choosing fruit tree varieties that are adapted to future climatic conditions, or boosting wild pollinators through improving landscape resources.

We selected 10 and 5 small ponds in similar environmental conditions, but with and without exotics, respectively. The numbers of fish, crustaceans, and nymphal odonates were smaller in ponds where exotics were found and some species were considered to be locally extinct in several ponds. On the other hand, the numbers of benthic organisms, i.e. tadpoles, chironomids, chaoborids, and Oligochaeta were more abundant in ponds with exotics. These two groups of organisms were separated clearly on the first axis of DCA, which indicats that this difference was mainly induced by bass predation. This result suggests a trophic cascade in which top-down effects induced by exotics propagated to fish, crustaceans, and nymphal odonates directly and to some benthic organisms indirectly. Therefore, when one is to conserve native organisms, attention should be paid not only to direct negative effects, but also to indirect effects propagating to various trophic levels. Because farm ponds are typical Japanese small lentic systems having rich biodiversities and bass and bluegill have been shown to change farm pond communities widely, conservational treatments including eradication of exotic fish should be conducted immediately.},

Although rarely quantified, effective population size (Ne) and genetic diversity should influence the magnitude of plastic and genetic changes manifested in captivity that reduce wild fitness. Sexually dimorphic traits might also mediate consequences of captivity. To evaluate these relationships, we generated {\textgreater}600 full- and half-sibling families from nine wild brook trout populations, reared them for one generation under common, captive environmental conditions and contrasted several fitness-related traits in wild versus captive lines. We found substantial variation in lifetime success (lifetime survival and reproductive success) and life history traits among wild populations after just one captive generation (fourteen- and threefold ranges across populations, respectively). Populations with lower heterozygosity showed lower captive lifetime success, suggesting that captivity generates maladaptation within one generation. Greater male-biased mortality in captivity occurred in populations having disproportionately higher growth rates in males than females. Wild population Ne and allelic diversity had little or no influence on captive trait expression and lifetime success. Our results have four conservation implications: (i) Trait values and lifetime success were highly variable across populations following one generation of captivity. (ii) Maladaptation induced by captive breeding might be particularly intense for the very populations practitioners are most interested in conserving, such as those with low heterozygosity. (iii) Maladaptive sex differences in captivity might be associated with population-dependent growth costs of reproduction. (iv) Heterozygosity can be a good indicator of short-term, intraspecific responses to novel environmental change.},

Thus, we aimed to analyse the impact of future climate change on the geographical distributions of 11 cactus species from the southern Central Andes and their spatial match with their pollinators. We used species distribution modelling to forecast the geographic range shifts of these cactus species and their pollinators under two future scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) for the years 2050 and 2070. We predicted geographic range contractions under future scenarios that reached almost 80\% for some cactus species. Our results indicate that the geographical distributions of cacti would be constrained by the presence of the pollinator species on which they depend in the present; however, climate change would not cause spatial mismatch between cacti and their animal pollinators in the future. For most cactus species, we predicted an increase in the spatial match with their mutualists under future scenarios. This is the first study that estimates the geographic range of cacti using both abiotic and biotic factors.

	abstract = {Summary Movement and dispersal are critical processes for almost all organisms in natural populations. Understanding their causes and consequences is therefore of high interest. While both theoretical and empirical work suggest that dispersal, more exactly emigration, is plastic and may be a function of local population density, the functional relationship between the underlying movement strategies and population density has received less attention. We here present evidence for the shape of this reaction norm and are able to differentiate between three possible cues: the relative number of individuals, the presence of metabolites (chemical cues) and resource availability. We performed microcosm experiments with the ciliate model organism Tetrahymena in order to understand the plasticity of movement strategies with respect to local density while controlling for possible confounding effects mediated by the availability of different cues. In addition, we investigated how an Allee effect can influence movement and dispersal plasticity. Our findings suggest that movement strategies in Tetrahymena are plastic and density-dependent. The observed movement reaction norm was U-shaped. This may be due to an Allee effect which led to negative density dependence at low population densities and generally positive density dependence at high population densities due to local competition. This possibly adaptive density-dependent movement strategy was likely mediated by chemical cues. Our experimental work in highly controlled conditions indicates that both environmental cues as well as inherent population dynamics must be considered to understand movement and dispersal.},

	abstract = {Summary Survival is often estimated from capture–recapture data using Cormack–Jolly–Seber (CJS) models, where mortality and emigration cannot be distinguished, and the estimated apparent survival probability is the product of the probabilities of true survival and of study area fidelity. Consequently, apparent survival is lower than true survival unless study area fidelity equals one. Underestimation of true survival from capture–recapture data is a main limitation of the method. We develop a spatial version of the CJS model that allows estimation of true survival. Besides the information about whether a specific individual was encountered at a given occasion, it is often recorded where the encounter occurred. Thus, information is available about the fraction of dispersal that occurs within the study area, and we use it to model dispersal and estimate true survival. Our model is formulated hierarchically and consists of survival, dispersal and observation submodels, assuming that encounters are possible anywhere within a study area. In a simulation study, our new spatial CJS model produced accurate estimates of true survival and dispersal behaviour for various sizes and shapes of the study area, even if emigration is substantial. However, when the information about dispersal is scarce due to low survival, low recapture probabilities and high emigration, the estimators are positively biased. Moreover, survival estimates are sensitive to the assumed dispersal kernel. We applied the spatial CJS model to a data set of adult red-backed shrikes (Lanius collurio). Apparent survival of males (c. 0·5) estimated with the CJS model was larger than in females (c. 0·4), but the application of the spatial CJS model revealed that both sexes had similar survival probabilities (c. 0·6). The mean breeding dispersal distance in females was c. 700 m, while males dispersed only c. 250 m between years. Spatial CJS models enable study of dispersal and survival independent of study design constraints such as imperfect detection and size of the study area provided that some of the dispersing individuals remain in the study area. We discuss possible extensions of our model: alternative dispersal models and the inclusion of covariates and of a habitat suitability map.},

	abstract = {Understanding what maintains species and perpetuates their coexistence in a network of feeding relationships (the food web) is of great importance for biodiversity conservation. A food web can be viewed as consisting of a number of simple subunits called trophic modules. Intraguild predation (IGP), in which a prey and its predator compete for the same resource, is one of the best-studied trophic modules. According to theory, there are two ways to yield a large persistent system from such modules: (i) to use persistent subunits as building blocks or (ii) to arrange the subunits in a way that externally supports the nonpersistent subunits. Here, I show that the complex food web of the Caribbean marine ecosystem is constructed in both ways. I show that IGP modules, which convey internal persistence because of the fact that prey are superior competitors for the resources, are overrepresented in the Caribbean ecosystem. The other modules, consisting of competitively inferior prey, are not persistent in isolation. However, competitively inferior prey in these modules tend to receive more advantage from extra-module interactions, which allows persistence of the IGP module. In addition, those exterior interactions tend to be provided by intrinsically persistent IGP modules to prevent cascading extinction of interacting IGP modules. The food web can be viewed as a set of interacting modules, nonrandomly arranged to enhance the maintenance of biodiversity.},

For many species, this information is lacking even for basic demographic rates such as survival and movement. When survival and movement estimates are available, they are often derived from mixed demographic groups and do not consider differences among life stages or sexes, which is critical, because life stages and sexes often contribute differentially to population dynamics. We used hierarchical models informed with spatial capture–mark–recapture data of Ascaphus montanus (Rocky Mountain tailed frog) in five streams and A. truei (coastal tailed frog) in one stream to estimate variation in survival and movement by sex and age, represented by size. By incorporating survival and movement into a single model, we were able to estimate both parameters with limited bias. Annual survival was similar between sexes of A. montanus [females = 0.885 (95\% CI 0.614–1), males = 0.901 (0.657–1)], but was slightly higher for female A. truei [0.836 (0.560–0.993)] than for males [0.664 (0.354–0.962)]. Survival of A. montanus peaked at mid-age, suggesting that lower survival of young and actuarial senescence may influence population demographics. Our models suggest that younger A. montanus moved farther than older individuals, and that females moved farther than males in both species. Our results provide uncommon insight into age- and sex-specific rates of survival and movement that are crucial elements of life-history strategies and are important for modeling population growth and prescribing conservation actions.},

	abstract = {Summary Capture–recapture (CR) techniques are commonly used to gain information about population dynamics, demography and life-history traits of populations. However, traditional CR models cannot separate mortality from emigration. Recently developed spatial–capture–recapture (SCR) models explicitly incorporate spatial information into traditional CR models, thus allowing for individuals' movements to be modelled explicitly. In this paper, we extend SCR models using robust-design data to allow for both processes in which individuals can disappear from the population, mortality and dispersal, to be estimated separately. We formulate a general robust-design spatial capture–recapture (RD-SCR) model, explore the properties of the model in a simulation study and compare the results to a Cormack–Jolly–Seber model and a non-spatial robust-design model with temporary emigration. In the case study, we fit several versions of the general model to data on field voles (Microtus agrestis) and compare the results with those from the non-spatial models fitted to the same data. We also evaluate assumptions of the fitted models with a series of simulation-based posterior predictive goodness-of-fit checks that are applicable to the SCR models in general and the RD-SCR model in particular. The simulation results show that the model preforms well under a wide range of dispersal distances. Our model outperforms the traditional CR models in terms of both accuracy and precision for survival. The case study showed that adult females have an c. 3·5 times higher mortality rate than adult males. Males have larger home ranges and disperse longer distances than females, but both males and females mostly move their activity centres within their previous home range between trapping sessions at 3-week intervals. Our RD-SCR model has several advantages compared to other approaches to estimate ‘true’ survival instead of only ‘apparent’ survival. Additionally, the model extracts information about space use and dispersal distributions that are relevant for behavioural studies as well as studies of life-history variation, population dynamics and management. The model can be widely applied due to the flexible framework, and other variations of the model could easily be implemented.},

	abstract = {Summary Movement is influenced by landscape structure, configuration and geometry, but measuring distance as perceived by animals poses technical and logistical challenges. Instead, movement is typically measured using Euclidean distance, irrespective of location or landscape structure, or is based on arbitrary cost surfaces. A recently proposed extension of spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models resolves this issue using spatial encounter histories of individuals to calculate least-cost paths (ecological distance: Ecology, 94, 2013, 287) thereby relaxing the Euclidean assumption. We evaluate the consequences of not accounting for movement heterogeneity when estimating abundance in highly structured landscapes, and demonstrate the value of this approach for estimating biologically realistic space-use patterns and landscape connectivity. We simulated SCR data in a riparian habitat network, using the ecological distance model under a range of scenarios where space-use in and around the landscape was increasingly associated with water (i.e. increasingly less Euclidean). To assess the influence of miscalculating distance on estimates of population size, we compared the results from the ecological and Euclidean distance based models. We then demonstrate that the ecological distance model can be used to estimate home range geometry when space use is not symmetrical. Finally, we provide a method for calculating landscape connectivity based on modelled species-landscape interactions generated from capture-recapture data. Using ecological distance always produced unbiased estimates of abundance. Explicitly modelling the strength of the species-landscape interaction provided a direct measure of landscape connectivity and better characterised true home range geometry. Abundance under the Euclidean distance model was increasingly (negatively) biased as space use was more strongly associated with water and, because home ranges are assumed to be symmetrical, produced poor characterisations of home range geometry and no information about landscape connectivity. The ecological distance SCR model uses spatially indexed capture-recapture data to estimate how activity patterns are influenced by landscape structure. As well as reducing bias in estimates of abundance, this approach provides biologically realistic representations of home range geometry, and direct information about species-landscape interactions. The incorporation of both structural (landscape) and functional (movement) components of connectivity provides a direct measure of species-specific landscape connectivity.},

Spatial capture–recapture (SCR) represents an individual-based analytic framework for overcoming this fundamental obstacle that has limited the utility of ecological theory. SCR methods make explicit use of spatial encounter information on individuals in order to model density and other spatial aspects of animal population structure, and they have been widely adopted in the last decade. We review the historical context and emerging developments in SCR models that enable the integration of explicit ecological hypotheses about landscape connectivity, movement, resource selection, and spatial variation in density, directly with individual encounter history data obtained by new technologies (e.g. camera trapping, non-invasive DNA sampling). We describe ways in which SCR methods stand to advance the study of animal population ecology.},

	abstract = {Summary 1.  Random dispersal leads to spatial coexistence via two mechanisms (emigration-mediated and source–sink), both of which involve the movement of organisms from areas of higher to lower fitness. What is not known is whether such coexistence would occur if organisms dispersed non-randomly, using cues such as density and habitat quality to gauge fitness differences between habitats. Here, I conduct a comparative analysis of random and non-random dispersal strategies in a foodweb with a basal resource, top predator, and two intermediate consumers that exhibit a trade-off between competitive ability and predator susceptibility. 2.  I find a striking contrast between density- and habitat-dependent dispersal in their effects on spatial coexistence. Dispersal in response to competitor and predator density facilitates coexistence while dispersal in response to habitat quality (resource productivity and predator pressure) inhibits it. Moreover, density-dependent dispersal changes species’ distribution patterns from interspecific segregation to interspecific aggregation, while habitat-dependent dispersal preserves the interspecific segregation observed in the absence of dispersal. Under density-dependent dispersal, widespread spatial coexistence results in an overall decline in the abundance of the inferior competitor that is less susceptible to predation and an overall increase in the abundance of the superior competitor that is more susceptible to predation. Under habitat-dependent dispersal, restricted spatial coexistence results in species’ abundances being essentially unchanged from those observed in the absence of dispersal. 3.  A key outcome is that when the superior competitor moves in the direction of increasing fitness but the inferior competitor does not, spatial coexistence is possible in both resource-poor and resource-rich habitats. However, when the inferior competitor moves in the direction of increasing fitness but the superior competitor does not, spatial coexistence is precluded in resource-poor habitats and greatly reduced in resource-rich habitats. This suggests that species-specific differences may play an important role in driving spatial coexistence patterns. 4.  The comparative framework yields predictions that can be tested with experiments that manipulate the relative mobilities of interacting species, or observational data on relative abundances and distribution patterns.},

We predicted how riparian bird communities changed in response to long-term changes in floodplain landscapes such as woodland expansion (i.e. rapid increases in vegetation cover on gravel bars and the progress of vegetation succession due to a decrease in the frequency and magnitude of flood disturbance). To test the hypothesis that woodland expansion after dam construction reduces the abundance of gravel bar-nesting birds and increases the abundance of forest-nesting birds, we estimated historical changes between past and present bird abundances using species distribution models across multiple rivers that were either unregulated or regulated by dams. We created past and present vegetation maps from remote sensing images and used habitat quantities as explanatory variables in the species distribution models. As we hypothesized, the estimated abundance of gravel bar-nesting birds decreased and that of forest-nesting birds increased because of woodland expansion in some regulated rivers. This suggests that anthropogenic alterations of riverine conditions (e.g. dam construction) can affect terrestrial ecosystems (e.g. riparian bird communities) through changes in floodplains (e.g. woodland expansion). In addition, our findings highlight the efficacy of combining spatial and temporal analyses when examining long-term ecological dynamics. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We combined this equation with concepts drawn from disturbance ecology to create a general model for population dynamics in disturbance-prone systems.

	abstract = {Ecological theory and observational evidence suggest that symbiotic interactions such as cleaning symbioses can shift from mutualism to parasitism. However, field experimental evidence documenting these shifts has never been reported for a cleaning symbiosis. Here, we demonstrate shifts in a freshwater cleaning symbiosis in a system involving crayfish and branchiobdellid annelids. Branchiobdellids have been shown to benefit their hosts under some conditions by cleaning material from host crayfish’s gill filaments. The system is uniquely suited as an experimental model for symbiosis due to ease of manipulation and ubiquity of the organisms. In three field experiments, we manipulated densities of worms on host crayfish and measured host growth in field enclosures. In all cases, the experiments revealed shifts from mutualism to parasitism: host crayfish growth was highest at intermediate densities of branchiobdellid symbionts, while high symbiont densities led to growth that was lower or not significantly different from 0-worm controls. Growth responses were consistent even though the three experiments involved different crayfish and worm species and were performed at different locations. Results also closely conformed to a previous laboratory experiment using the same system. The mechanism for these shifts appears to be that branchiobdellids switched from cleaning host gills at intermediate densities of worms to consuming host gill tissue at high densities. These outcomes clearly demonstrate shifts along a symbiosis continuum with the maximum benefits to the host at intermediate symbiont densities. At high symbiont densities, benefits to the host disappear, and there is some evidence for a weak parasitism. These are the first field experimental results to demonstrate such shifts in a cleaning symbiosis.},

	abstract = {The role of positive interactions in structuring plant and animal communities is increasingly recognized, but the generality of current theoretical models has remained practically unexplored in animal communities. The stress gradient hypothesis predicts a linear increase in the intensity of facilitation as environmental conditions become increasingly stressful, whereas other theoretical models predict a maximum at intermediate environmental stress. We tested how competition and facilitation between herbivores change over a manipulated gradient of nutrient availability. We studied the effect of grazing by pond snails (Lymnaea stagnalis L.) as bulk grazers on aquatic caterpillars (Acentria ephemerella Denis and Schiffermüller) as small specialist grazers along an experimental gradient of environmental nutrient concentration. Higher nutrient levels increased overall total plant biomass but induced a shift toward dominance of filamentous algae at the expense of macrophytes. Facilitation of caterpillars by snail presence peaked at intermediate nutrient levels. Both caterpillar biomass and caterpillar grazing on macrophytes were highest at intermediate nutrient levels. Snails facilitated caterpillars possibly by removing filamentous algae and increasing access to the macrophyte resource, whereas they did not affect macrophyte biomass or C : nutrient ratios, a measure of food quality. We conclude that competition and facilitation in herbivore communities change along nutrient availability gradients that affect plant biomass and community composition. Understanding how interspecific interactions may change in strength and direction along environmental gradients is important to predict how the diversity and structure of communities may respond to the introduction or removal of herbivore species in ecosystems.},

We conducted a playback experiment of mobbing calls to examine the probabilities of forest birds to cross a distance of 50m over urban matrix with different land-cover types in an urban area. We treated the reciprocal of the crossing probabilities as a movement resistance for forest birds. We drew resistance surfaces based on the land-cover maps of urban Sapporo. We applied a circuit theory to examine the relative role of a detour route consisting of a riparian corridor and urban matrix for dispersing forest bird individuals from continuous forest to an isolated green space in the midst of an urban area. Our results showed that wood cover had the highest crossing probability, while open land (grassland and pavement) had the lowest probabilities. Buildings and water surface displayed an intermediate probability. Resistance surfaces and flow maps at 25- and 50-m resolutions were very similar and suggested that dispersing individuals are likely to use the intervening building areas that dominate the urban matrix rather than detour through riparian corridors. Our results showed the useful combination of experimental approaches and circuit theory, and the importance of the spatial configuration of corridors, as well as the composition and management of dispersal habitats, to landscape connectivity.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00442-004-1609-0},
	abstract = {Predator induced morphological defenses are marked morphological shifts induced directly by cues associated with a predator. Generally, remote cues, i.e., chemical substances emitted from predators or injured conspecifics, are considered to be ideal signals to induce morphological change in aquatic environments rather than close cues, i.e., close chemical or tactile cues, since chemical substances that can propagate over relatively long distances and persist for a long period may allow organisms to keep safe and to deliberately change their morph. In fact, most organisms adopting an inducible morphological defense utilize remote chemical cues to detect predation risk and to produce morphological defenses. In this paper, we report a unique and functionally well designed inducible morphological defense strategy where the induction process requires close cues from a predator. The tadpoles of Rana pirica exhibited a bulgy bodied morphology when threatened with predation by larval salamanders, Hynobius retardatus, in close proximity. Predation trials and a function experiment showed that the induced bulgy morph is an adaptive defense phenotype against the gape-limited predator larval H. retardatus. Furthermore, R. pirica tadpoles use two adaptive strategies in terms of cost saving, i.e., adjustment of the extent of bulginess according to predation risk and reversibility by actual shrink of bulgy body after removing the predation threat. In general, R. pirica hatch earlier than H. retardatus. In natural ponds, during the early developmental stage R. pirica tadpoles live in close proximity to young H. retardatus larvae. As they grow, the salamanders gradually become serious predators and the predator–prey interaction becomes intimate. After a while, predation, cannibalism and metamorphosis decrease the number of salamanders in the ponds, and the predator–prey interaction weakens. Such a phenology in the predator–prey interaction allows the evolution of a close-cue detection system and adaptive cost-saving strategies. Our results highlight that the characteristics of the inducible defense depend on the intensity and specificity of the predator–prey system.},

These mechanisms have rarely been demonstrated directly, and most evidence of the rescue effect is from relationships between isolation and extinction. We determined the frequency of recolonisation rescue for metapopulations of black rails (Laterallus jamaicensis) and Virginia rails (Rallus limicola) from occupancy surveys conducted during and between breeding seasons, and assessed the reliability of inferences about the occurrence of rescue drawn from isolation–extinction relationships, including autologistic isolation measures that corrected for unsurveyed patches and imperfect detection. Recolonisation rescue occurred at expected rates, but was elevated during periods of disturbance that resulted in non-equilibrium metapopulation dynamics. Inferences from extinction–isolation relationships were unreliable, particularly for autologistic measures and for the more vagile Virginia rail.},

	abstract = {Many threatened species including elephants, sturgeons, and bluefin tunas are harvested for high-value products. Species can be driven extinct if incentives to harvest do not diminish as populations decline; this occurs if harvest prices rise faster than costs with declining stock. Whereas recent conservation attention for these species has largely focused on market demand, we show—using a theoretical model and an empirical review—that contractions in species’ geographic ranges, which stabilize costs and may be especially common among terrestrial species, might often play a larger role in maintaining harvest incentives. Forces impacting ranges—such as patchy and declining habitats, schooling/herding behavior, and climate change—therefore merit greater attention in assessing overharvesting threats.Economic incentives to harvest a species usually diminish as its abundance declines, because harvest costs increase. This prevents harvesting to extinction. A known exception can occur if consumer demand causes a declining species’ harvest price to rise faster than costs. This threat may affect rare and valuable species, such as large land mammals, sturgeons, and bluefin tunas. We analyze a similar but underappreciated threat, which arises when the geographic area (range) occupied by a species contracts as its abundance declines. Range contractions maintain the local densities of declining populations, which facilitates harvesting to extinction by preventing abundance declines from causing harvest costs to rise. Factors causing such range contractions include schooling, herding, or flocking behaviors—which, ironically, can be predator-avoidance adaptations; patchy environments; habitat loss; and climate change. We use a simple model to identify combinations of range contractions and price increases capable of causing extinction from profitable overharvesting, and we compare these to an empirical review. We find that some aquatic species that school or forage in patchy environments experience sufficiently severe range contractions as they decline to allow profitable harvesting to extinction even with little or no price increase; and some high-value declining aquatic species experience severe price increases. For terrestrial species, the data needed to evaluate our theory are scarce, but available evidence suggests that extinction-enabling range contractions may be common among declining mammals and birds. Thus, factors causing range contraction as abundance declines may pose unexpectedly large extinction risks to harvested species.},

However, the supporting evidence is unclear, especially regarding the survival of hyporheic refugees and their contribution to the recovery of post-disturbance populations. Moreover, few studies have focused on the importance of the hyporheic refuge for aquatic vertebrates such as fish. In this study, we present evidence that the hyporheic zone acts as a refuge for a small benthic fish (Cobitis shikokuensis) following surface drying in an intermittent river. We examined its survival during and recolonization after dry periods by direct hyporheic sampling and mark-and-recapture surveys. When the streambed dried, hyporheic sampling was conducted 58 times across 33 locations in the intermittent reach and 31 individuals of C. shikokuensis were captured from extracted hyporheic water. Mark-and-recapture surveys revealed that recolonizers after re-wetting included C. shikokuensis individuals that had survived dry periods in the hyporheic refuge. The condition factor of C. shikokuensis significantly declined after dry periods, suggesting that most recolonizers suffered from physiological stress, probably within the hyporheic refuge. These results clearly support the long-debated, hyporheic refuge hypothesis, and provide a striking example of the critical role of the hyporheic zone in population maintenance of lotic organisms.},

Specifically, we suggest that in wetlands that never dry (permanent), predators limit mosquito abundance, whereas in wetlands that dry yearly (temporary), competitors that are well adapted to predictable drying, limit mosquito abundance. However, in wetlands that dry only during drought years (semi-permanent), mosquito predators and competitors are eliminated and must recolonize following a drought, and the abundance of wetland mosquitoes can skyrocket. We present supportive evidence for this hypothesis from surveys of natural wetlands and from a controlled mesocosm experiment. We conclude that this framework may provide a reliable way to predict and prepare for year-to-year variation in mosquito abundances at large spatial scales.},

Consequently, ecologists wish to identify environmental settings that promote such variation. Theory predicts that environments with greater resource diversity favour ecological diversity among consumers (via disruptive selection or plasticity). Alternatively, niche variation might be a side-effect of neutral genomic diversity in larger populations. We tested these alternatives in a metapopulation of threespine stickleback. Stickleback consume benthic and limnetic invertebrates, focusing on the former in small lakes, the latter in large lakes. Intermediate-sized lakes support generalist stickleback populations using an even mixture of the two prey types, and exhibit greater among-individual variation in diet and morphology. In contrast, genomic diversity increases with lake size. Thus, phenotypic diversity and neutral genetic polymorphism are decoupled: trophic diversity being greatest in intermediate-sized lakes with high resource diversity, whereas neutral genetic diversity is greatest in the largest lakes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Research focusing on among-individual differences in behaviour (‘animal personality’) has been blooming for over a decade. Central theories explaining the maintenance of such behavioural variation posits that individuals expressing greater “risky” behaviours should suffer higher mortality. Here, for the first time, we synthesize the existing empirical evidence for this key prediction. Our results did not support this prediction as there was no directional relationship between riskier behaviour and greater mortality; however there was a significant absolute relationship between behaviour and survival. In total, behaviour explained a significant, but small, portion (5.8\%) of the variance in survival. We also found that risky (vs. “shy”) behavioural types live significantly longer in the wild, but not in the laboratory. This suggests that individuals expressing risky behaviours might be of overall higher quality but the lack of predation pressure and resource restrictions mask this effect in laboratory environments. Our work demonstrates that individual differences in behaviour explain important differences in survival but not in the direction predicted by theory. Importantly, this suggests that models predicting behaviour to be a mediator of reproduction-survival trade-offs may need revision and/or empiricists may need to reconsider their proxies of risky behaviours when testing such theory.},

We investigated how different levels of connectedness affect trait evolution in experimental metapopulations of the two-spotted spider mite. We separated local- and metapopulation-level selection and linked trait divergence to population dynamics. With lower connectedness, an increased starvation resistance and delayed dispersal evolved. Reproductive performance evolved locally by transgenerational plasticity or epigenetic processes. Costs of dispersal, but also changes in local densities and temporal fluctuations herein are found to be putative drivers. In addition to dispersal, demographic traits are able to evolve in response to metapopulation connectedness at both the local and metapopulation level by genetic and/or non-genetic inheritance. These trait changes impact the persistence of spatially structured populations.},

	abstract = {Abstract A fundamental goal of disease ecology is to determine the landscape and environmental processes that drive disease dynamics at different biological levels to guide management and conservation. Although ranaviruses (family Iridoviridae) are emerging amphibian pathogens, few studies have conducted comprehensive field surveys to assess potential drivers of ranavirus disease dynamics. We examined the factors underlying patterns in site-level ranavirus presence and individual-level ranavirus infection in 76 ponds and 1,088 individuals representing five amphibian species within the East Bay region of California. Based on a competing-model approach followed by variance partitioning, landscape and biotic variables explained the most variation in site-level presence. However, biotic and individual-level variables explained the most variation in individual-level infection. Distance to nearest ranavirus-infected pond (the landscape factor) was more important than biotic factors at the site level; however, biotic factors were most influential at the individual level. At the site level, the probability of ranavirus presence correlated negatively with distance to nearest ranavirus-positive pond, suggesting that the movement of water or mobile taxa (e.g., adult amphibians, birds, reptiles) may facilitate the movement of ranavirus between ponds and across the landscape. Taxonomic richness associated positively with ranavirus presence at the site level, but vertebrate richness associated negatively with infection prevalence in the host population. This might reflect the contrasting influences of diversity on pathogen colonisation versus transmission among hosts. Amphibian host species differed in their likelihood of ranavirus infection: American bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) had the weakest association with infection while rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa) had the strongest. After accounting for host species effects, hosts with greater snout–vent length had a lower probability of infection. Our study demonstrates the array of landscape, environmental, and individual-level factors associated with ranavirus epidemiology. Moreover, our study helps illustrate that the importance of these factors varies with biological level.},

Projected effects of climate change and land alterations suggest headwater streams may become more intermittent and less predictable, consequently altering biological processes (i.e. dispersal or movement) that govern population dynamics. Few studies have provided insight into movement dynamics of nongame fishes in small headwater streams that commonly experience intermittent conditions. The purpose of this study was to investigate movement of a fish species adapted to intermittent stream conditions. Our objectives were to (i) describe the general movement patterns of creek chub, Semotilus atromaculatus, in an intermittent stream and (ii) investigate which ecological factors may influence movement in patchy environments. Creek chub displayed some of the longest distances moved compared to many other stream fishes in perennial streams (179–1069 m seasonal averages; 4678 m maximum distance). Directional movement was significant only in May with more individuals moving upstream. The probability of creek chub movement was inversely related to habitat complexity and pool area. Creek chub adapted to intermittent stream conditions not only exhibited increases in the frequency and distance of movement compared to other nongame fishes, but also exhibited movements in relation to local habitat metrics. These results demonstrate some of the potential adaptations that are likely to promote the survival and persistence of populations in highly dynamic environments such as intermittent streams.},

Over 2-week intervals, 44\% of recaptured fish changed patches. Net distances moved ranged from 4 to 606 m, median distance moved was 49 m. Of fish recaptured repeatedly during the four sampling periods, most (65\%) changed patches at least once, but few were consistently mobile. Inter-patch distance was an important variable with a negative effect on creek chub movements. Inter-patch cover was less important, but had a positive effect on movements. Frequent, short-distance movements among habitat patches in summer are a component of the ecology of creek chubs and the spatial arrangement of patches, and intervening stream conditions appear to mediate those movements.},

We investigated the relationship between the primary productivity of lake ecosystems and the number of species for lacustrine phytoplankton, rotifers, cladocerans, copepods, macrophytes, and fish. Our study includes two parts: (1) a survey of 33 well-studied lakes for which data on six major taxonomic groups were available; and (2) a comparison of the effects of short- and long-term whole-lake nutrient addition on primary productivity and planktonic species richness. In the survey, species richness of all six taxa showed a significant quadratic response to increased annual primary productivity (14C estimate, g C·m−2·yr−1) when lake area is taken into account. However, the richness–productivity relationship for phytoplankton and fish was strongly dependent on lake area. The relationship for phytoplankton, rotifers, cladocerans, copepods, and macrophytes was significantly unimodal. Species richness generally peaked at levels of primary productivity in the range of 30–300 g C·m−2·yr−1. For the average lake size, the highest biodiversity tended to occur in lakes with relatively low primary productivity, such as those found in the Northern Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in the upper Midwest (United States) and in the Experimental Lakes Area of Ontario (Canada). Based on short-term (3 yr) and long-term (21–24 yr) experiments, we tested whether individual lakes respond to whole-lake enrichment experiments in the manner suggested by analyses of survey data. Experimental addition of nutrients produced varied and unpredictable responses in species richness, probably due to transient dynamics and time lags. Responses to nutrient addition were taxon and lake specific. Phytoplankton showed a variety of relationships between species richness and pelagic primary productivity (PPR), depending on the history of enrichment and recovery. No significant effect of primary productivity on rotifer richness occurred in any of the experimental lakes, whereas richness of crustacean zooplankton was negatively correlated with primary productivity in both the short- and long-term experiments.},

	abstract = {Abstract Dispersers are often not a random draw from a population, dispersal propensity being conditional on individual phenotypic traits and local contexts. This non-randomness consequently results in phenotypic differences between dispersers and non-dispersers and, in the context of biological invasions, in an invasion front made of individuals with a biased phenotype. This bias of phenotypes at the front may subsequently modulate the strength of ecological effects of an invasive species on invaded communities. We recently demonstrated that more asocial mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), one of the 100 worst invasive species, disperse further, suggesting a sociability-biased invasion front. As behavioural types are related to the strength of interspecific interactions, an invasion by a biased subset of individuals should have important ecological implications for native communities. Here, we tested the impact of phenotypic biases in dispersing individuals (relative to non-dispersers) on prey communities in experimental mesocosms. We show that dispersers reduce prey abundance more than do non-dispersers during the first 4 weeks after introduction, and that the disperser's social types are likely drivers of these differences. These differences in prey communities disappeared after 8 weeks suggesting prey community resilience against predation in these mesocosm ecosystems. Consequently, we call for the integration of non-random dispersal, dispersal syndromes and more generally intraspecific variation into studies predicting the impacts of invasions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Little is known about the effect of short-term flow changes on the movement of northern pike (Esox lucius L.). We conducted a comparative study in two rivers with different flow regimes (i.e. one regulated and one unregulated) to evaluate the extent to which adult northern pike movement is influenced by short-term river flow conditions. Data on northern pike hourly movement were collected in northeastern Ontario on 40 individuals in the Mississagi River, a river subjected to extreme daily flow variations associated with hydro-electric operations (i.e. hydropeaking), and the Aubinadong River, an unregulated river. Using manual tracking by radio-telemetry, we found that northern pike moved at a higher rate in the river subjected to short-term changes in river flow than in the unregulated river. Results also show that the relationship between movement of northern pike and flow can vary among rivers. In the Mississagi River, flow had a significant positive effect on northern pike activity, while the effect of flow in the Aubinadong River depended on water temperature. Moreover, fish in the Mississagi River utilized a restricted river section and travelled more laterally in comparison to fish inhabiting the Aubinadong River, where longer upstream-downstream movements were more common. The present study contributes to our understanding of the effects of short-term changes in flow on fish movement. This constitutes the first step towards assessing the effect of flow on fish habitat use, and eventually developing flow management strategies to mitigate impacts on fish.

	abstract = {Successful dispersal can enhance both individual fitness and population persistence, but the process of dispersal is often inherently risky. The interplay between the costs and benefits of dispersal are poorly documented for species with complex life histories due to the difficulty of tracking dispersing individuals. Here we investigate variability in dispersal histories of a freshwater fish, Awaous stamineus, across the species' entire geographic range in the Hawaiian archipelago. Like many animals endemic to tropical island streams, these gobies have an amphidromous life cycle in which a brief marine larval phase enables dispersal among isolated freshwater habitats. Using otolith microchemistry, we document three distinct marine dispersal pathways, all of which are observed on every island. Surprisingly, we also find that 62\% of individuals complete their life cycle entirely within freshwater, in contrast to the assumption that amphidromy is obligate in Hawaiian stream gobies. Comparing early life history outcomes based on daily otolith growth rings, we find that individuals with marine dispersal have shorter larval durations and faster larval growth, and their growth advantage over purely freshwater counterparts continues to some degree into adult life. These individual benefits of maintaining a marine dispersal phase presumably balance against the challenge of finding and reentering an island stream from the ocean. The facultative nature of amphidromy in this species highlights the selective balance between costs and benefits of dispersal in life history evolution. Accounting for alternative dispersal strategies will be essential for conservation of the amphidromous species that often dominate tropical island streams, many of which are at risk of extinction.},

	abstract = {Most spatial population models assume constant rates of dispersal. However, in a given community, dispersal may not only depend on the density of conspecifics, i.e. density-dependent dispersal, but also on the density of other species, a phenomenon we term ‘community-dependent dispersal’. We co-vary the densities of both the beetle host Callosobruchus chinensis and its parasitoid wasp, Anisopteromalus calandrae, in a laboratory study and record the proportions of each species that disperse within a two-hour period. The parasitoid in these systems exhibits community-dependent dispersal – dispersing more frequently when parasitoid density is high and larval host density is low. This supported our prediction that individuals should disperse according to competition for available resources. However, in this study the host's dispersal was independent of density. We suggest that this may be due to less intense selection acting on host dispersal strategies than on the parasitoid. We consider some possible consequences of community-dependent dispersal for a number of spatial population processes. A well-known host-parasitoid metapopulation model is expanded so that it includes a greater range of dispersal functions. When the model is parameterised with the parasitoid community-dependent dispersal function observed in the empirical study, similar population dynamics are obtained as when fixed-rate dispersal functions are applied. The importance of dispersal functions for invasions of both competitive and host-parasitoid systems is also considered. The model results demonstrate that understanding how individuals disperse in response to different species’ population densities is important in determining the rate of spread of an invasion. We suggest that more empirical studies are needed to establish what determines dispersal rate and distance in a range of species, combined with theoretical studies investigating the role of the dispersal function in determining spatial population processes.},

	abstract = {Response of species to their environment is dependent on the scales that individuals interact with landscapes. Several life-history traits have been suggested to influence scales of response to landscapes, but little empirical work has addressed this issue, limiting our ability to predict the relevant scale(s) at which species respond to their environment. Body size is frequently hypothesized to be relevant for predicting the effects of landscape structure on species given correlations between body size and various measures of mobility or perceptual range, yet evidence of this relationship remains equivocal. We conducted a meta-analysis of 22 studies to address the question of whether body size is related to the characteristic scale at which bird species respond to landscape structure. On the basis of correlation coefficients and linear mixed models, we show that body size is positively related to the characteristic scale of response to landscapes. The strength of this relationship is less than body size – dispersal allometries, suggesting that response to landscapes may be influenced, in part, by factors other than dispersal (e.g. territory size). However, the strength of the observed body size – scale relationship may have been affected by several factors, including limitations in the range of body sizes and landscape extents tested. Our findings suggest that life-history traits mediate aspects of the scales at which species respond to the landscape and contribute to developing a more predictive framework for investigating scalar relationships in nature.},

	abstract = {The services provided within a community can change as the species composition of that community changes. For example, ant–seed dispersal mutualisms can be disrupted in habitats dominated by invasive ants. We propose that this disruption is related to changes in mean ant body size, given that invasive ants are smaller than most native seed-dispersing ants. We demonstrate that the mean and maximum distances that ants transport seeds adapted for ant dispersal increase with worker body size, and that this relationship is an accelerating power function. This pattern is consistent among three ant subfamilies that include most seed-dispersing ants as well as most invasive ant species, is generalizable across ant species and communities, and is independent of diaspore mass. Using a case study, we demonstrate that both the mean body size of seed-collecting ants and seed dispersal distances are decreased in sites invaded by Solenopsis invicta, the imported red fire ant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mean size of seed-collecting ants at a seed depot or within a community is a useful predictor of mean seed dispersal distances at those sites. Last, we show that small seed-collecting ants and decreased seed dispersal distances are common features of sites occupied by invasive ants. The link between ant body size and seed dispersal distance, combined with the dominance of invaded communities by typically small ants, predicts the disruption of native ant–seed dispersal mutualisms in invaded habitats.},

We sampled quarterly over a 3-year period (1985–1988) at six 800- to 2300-m-long sites in 2 streams near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Overall, distances between successive captures were {\textless} 100 m for approximately two-thirds of all fishes. Only rarely did we document movements over long distances; distances of 17.0-17.6 km between successive captures were obtained for 5 fishes (1 redbreast sunfish, 1 largemouth bass and 3 bluegill), and only one other fish moved {\textgreater} 10 km. In general, all species were highly sedentary in both streams, with rock bass and redbreast sunfish being the most sedentary and bluegill and largemouth bass being the least. In most instances, redbreast sunfish showed the same distribution of distances between captures regardless of the interval between captures (1 week, 3 months, 6 months or more). This species also tended to be more mobile in the spring and less mobile in the winter, with large fish exibiting the greatest distances between captures. Some redbreast sunfish showed a very restricted home range, being captured 3 or more times over ≥ 6 months in the same 50-m section of stream. A few individuals moved 4-9 km only to return to their original location, but most fish exhibited behaviors intermediate between these extremes. For all species, upstream and downstream movements were equally common, although movements in one direction predominated at some sites for limited periods of time. Knowledge of movement patterns and differences in behavior among species is important not only in understanding the basic ecology of the species but also in designing, conducting and interpreting environmental monitoring studies.},

We used a large-scale field experiment (32 small islands sampled over 5 years) to probe how the frequency and magnitude of pulsed seaweed inputs drives temporal variation in the top–down effects of lizard predators. Short-term weakening of lizard effects on spiders and plants (the latter via a trophic cascade) were associated with lizard diet shifts, and were more pronounced with larger seaweed inputs. Long-term strengthening of lizard effects was associated with lizard numerical responses and plant fertilisation. Increased pulse frequency reinforced the strengthening of lizard effects on spiders and plants. These results underscore the temporally variable nature of top–down effects and highlight the role of resource pulses in driving this variation.},

	abstract = {Abstract The foundational ecosystem processes of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) cannot be measured directly but can be modeled in aquatic ecosystems from subdaily patterns of oxygen (O2) concentrations. Because rivers and streams constantly exchange O2 with the atmosphere, models must either use empirical estimates of the gas exchange rate coefficient (K600) or solve for all three parameters (GPP, ER, and K600) simultaneously. Empirical measurements of K600 require substantial field work and can still be inaccurate. Three-parameter models have suffered from equifinality, where good fits to O2 data are achieved by many different parameter values, some unrealistic. We developed a new three-parameter, multiday model that ensures similar values for K600 among days with similar physical conditions (e.g., discharge). Our new model overcomes the equifinality problem by (1) flexibly relating K600 to discharge while permitting moderate daily deviations and (2) avoiding the oft-violated assumption that residuals in O2 predictions are uncorrelated. We implemented this hierarchical state-space model and several competitor models in an open-source R package, streamMetabolizer. We then tested the models against both simulated and field data. Our new model reduces error by as much as 70\% in daily estimates of K600, GPP, and ER. Further, accuracy benefits of multiday data sets require as few as 3 days of data. This approach facilitates more accurate metabolism estimates for more streams and days, enabling researchers to better quantify carbon fluxes, compare streams by their metabolic regimes, and investigate controls on aquatic activity.},

We evaluated the difference in the apparent survival rates of semi-native and domesticated juvenile char after their stocking in mountain streams. The analysis used multi-site variable time-series data with a Bayesian multi-variate state-space model reflecting the characteristics of the data, including time-series variation, site-specific effects, and observation error. The resulting odds ratio, which represents the general and potential strain effect of the semi-native char stocking, was 2.49 (95\% CI = 2.12–2.94), implying that the apparent survival rate of the semi-native char was approximately 2.5 times higher than that of the domesticated char in the mountain streams studied.

Here, we investigate how stream network geometry constrains the spatial influence of aquatic insect subsidies in terrestrial ecosystems. We also explore potential factors (i.e., climate, topography, soils, and vegetation) that could produce variation in stream network geometry and thus change the extent of aquatic insect subsidies from one region to another. The stream signature is the percentage of aquatic insect subsidies traveling a given distance into the terrestrial ecosystem, relative to what comes out of the stream. We use this concept to model the spatial extent (area) and distribution (spatial patterning) of aquatic subsidies in terrestrial ecosystems across the contiguous United States. Our findings suggest that at least 8\% of the subsidies measured at the aquatic–terrestrial boundary (i.e., the 8\% stream signature) are typically transferred throughout the entire watershed and that variation in this spatial extent is largely influenced by the drainage density of the stream network. Moreover, we found stream signatures from individual stream reaches overlap such that the spatial extent of the 8\% stream signature often includes inputs from multiple stream reaches. Landscape-scale stream network characteristics increased the area of overlapping stream signatures more than reach-scale channel properties. Finally, we found runoff was an important factor influencing stream network geometry suggesting a potential effect of climate on aquatic-to-terrestrial linkages that have been understudied.},

In total, our data set spans 559 observations across 147 lakes from the boreal to subtropics. By predicting terrestrial resource support from within-lake and catchment-level characteristics, we found that half of all consumer observations that is, the median were composed of at least 42\% terrestrially derived material. In general, terrestrial support of zooplankton was greatest in lakes with large physical and hydrological connections to catchments that were rich in aboveground and belowground organic matter. However, some consumers responded less strongly to terrestrial resources where within-lake production was elevated.

We also translate the proposed framework into an explicit community dynamic model and use the model as a tool for generating testable predictions concerning how landscape properties interact with species traits in determining the shape of HDRs. Our main finding is that, despite the enormous complexity of such interactions, the predicted HDRs are rather simple, ranging from positive to unimodal patterns in a highly consistent and predictable manner.},

We outline three methods for calculating atmospheric reaeration but concentrate on the use of statistical estimation to simultaneously estimate reaeration and metabolic rates using Bayesian model fitting. While there are existing programs (ModelMaker and Bayesian Metabolic Model [BaMM]), these are either slow or unable to be used easily for fitting multiple days of metabolic data (one to many months).

To examine these possibilities, we estimated the ecosystem metabolism of 30 rivers located from 43.03°N to 32.38°N in Japan during summer using a Bayesian model with hourly changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations. In addition, we examined latitudinal trends of GPP, ER and NEP in a global scale by compiling and analyzing river metabolic data estimated in previous studies. Our analysis showed that both GPP and ER tended to increase with latitude, although these rates were positively related to water temperature in Japanese rivers. Global dataset of GPP and ER also showed increasing trend towards higher latitude. In addition, contrary to our initial expectations, NEP decreased with latitude and most rivers were net heterotrophic at both regional (Japanese rivers) and global scales. These results imply that the latitudinal temperature effect on river metabolism is masked by other factors not examined in this study, such as land use in the watershed, which play pivotal roles in explaining the latitudinal variation of river metabolism.},

At large spatial scales, we observed broad differences in periphyton δ13C among biomes and consistent longitudinal variation related to watershed area. Longitudinal increases in δ13C indicate the importance of in-stream processes on lotic carbon cycles and autotroph δ13C variation. At local spatial scales, periphyton δ13C was negatively related to canopy cover and water current velocity and positively related to chlorophyll a density. Autotroph δ13C varied among taxonomic groups. Cyanobacteria and red algae had significantly higher and lower δ13C than other taxa, respectively. A hierarchical model across spatial scales showed that local controls for periphyton δ13C were nested by regional controls, which suggested that productivity and CO2 availability determine δ13C.

Conceptual models predict that in situ primary production should vary with river characteristics, but the influence of autochthonous resource availability on the capacity for river reaches to support fish is poorly understood. We estimated primary production throughout the South Fork and Middle Fork of the John Day River, Oregon, by measuring diel cycles in dissolved oxygen (DO) during July 2013. Using these data, we (1) evaluated the extent to which juvenile salmonid abundance and resource limitation correlated with areas of high gross primary production (GPP), (2) developed models to predict GPP from both site-level measurements and remotely sensed data, and (3) made predictions of GPP across the entirety of the Middle Fork John Day River (MFJD) network and assessed the utility of these spatially continuous predictions for describing variation fish densities at broad scales. We produced reliable estimates of GPP at sites where DO loggers were deployed using measurements of solar exposure, water temperature, and conductivity measured at each site, as well as surrogates for these data estimated from remote sensing data sources. Estimates of GPP across fish sampling sites explained, on average, 58–63\% of the variation in juvenile salmonid densities during the summer sampling period, and 51–83\% during the fall sampling period, while continuous network predictions of GPP explained 44\% of the variation in fish densities across 29 km of the MFJD. Further, GPP explained nearly half of the variation in juvenile steelhead dietary resource limitation, as inferred from bioenergetics modeling results. These results comprise a first effort at quantifying variation in autochthonous production across an entire river network and, importantly, provide a much-needed food-web context for guiding more effective fish and habitat management.},

In the forested watershed of a river under a mediterranean hydrologic regime, we examined the influence of longitudinal changes in environmental conditions on water-column nutrient composition during summer base flow across a network of sites ranging from strongly heterotrophic headwater streams to larger, more autotrophic sites downstream. Small streams (0.1–10 km2 watershed area) had longitudinally similar nutrient concentration and composition with low (∼2) dissolved nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) ratios. Abrupt deviations from this pattern were observed in larger streams with watershed areas {\textgreater}100 km2 where insolation and algal abundance and production rapidly increased. Downstream, phosphorus and silica concentrations decreased by {\textgreater}50\% compared to headwater streams, and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen increased by ∼3–6 times. Decreasing dissolved P and increasing dissolved N raised stream-water N:P to 46 at the most downstream sites, suggesting a transition from N limitation in headwaters to potential P limitation in larger channels. We hypothesize that these changes were mediated by increasing algal photosynthesis and N fixation by benthic algal assemblages, which, in response to increasing light availability, strongly altered stream-water nutrient concentration and stoichiometry in larger streams and rivers.},

While the δ13C and δ15N values have many advantages as a natural tracer, the controls over their high spatial and temporal variability in stream periphyton are not well known. Here, we present the global dataset of δ13C and δ15N values of lotic periphyton from 54 published and two unpublished sources, including 978 observations from 148 streams/rivers in 38 regions around the world, from arctic to tropical sites. The 54 published sources were articles recorded during the period of 1994–2016 in 25 academic journals. The two unpublished sources were from the authors’ own data. The dataset showed that δ13C and δ15N values of periphyton ranged from −47.3 to −9.3‰ and from −5.6 to + 22.6‰, respectively. The dataset also includes physicochemical factors (altitude, coordinates, catchment area, width, depth, geology, vegetation, canopy coverage, biome, season, presence of anadromous salmon, temperature, pH, current velocity, and discharge), nutrient data (nitrate and ammonium concentrations), and algal attributes (chlorophyll a concentration, algal species compositions, and carbonates removal) in streams/rivers studied, all of which may help interpret the δ13C and δ15N values of periphyton. The metadata file outlines structure of all the data and with references for data sources, providing a resource for future food web studies in stream and river ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Abstract In fisheries management, intensive stocking programs are commonly used to enhance population abundance and maintain stock productivity. However, such practices are increasingly raising concerns as multiple studies documented adverse genetic and evolutionary impacts of stocking on wild populations. Improvement of stocking management relies on a better understanding of the dynamic of introgressive hybridization between wild and domestic population and on assessment of the genetic state of wild populations after stocking cessation. In Québec, Canada, over five million captive-reared Brook Charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) are stocked every year to support recreational fishing activities. Here, we investigated how variation in stocking history and environmental variables, including water temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen, may influence the impact of stocking practices on the genetic integrity of wild Brook Charr populations. We collected DNA samples (n = 862, average of 30 individuals per lake) from 29 lakes that underwent different stocking intensity through time and also collected environmental parameters for each sampled lake. An average of 4,580 high-quality filtered SNPs was obtained for each population using genotyping by sequencing (GBS), which were then used to quantify the mean domestic membership of each sampled population. An exhaustive process of model selection was conducted to obtain a best-fitted model that explained 56\% of the variance observed in mean domestic genetic membership. The number of years since the mean year of stocking was the best explanatory variable to predict variation in mean domestic genetic membership whereas environmental characteristics had little influence on observed patterns of admixture. Our model predictions also revealed that each sampled wild population could potentially return to a wild genetic state (absence of domestic genetic background) after stocking cessation. Overall, our study provides new insights on factors determining level of introgressive hybridization and suggests that stocking impacts could be reversible with time.},

As research has expanded, it has become clear that these globally used insecticides directly affect other ecosystem components, including vertebrates. Yamamuro et al. now show that these compounds are indirectly affecting species through trophic cascades (see the Perspective by Jensen). Since the application of neonicotinoids to agricultural fields began in the 1990s, zooplankton biomass has plummeted in a Japanese lake surrounded by these fields. This decline has led to shifts in food web structure and a collapse of two commercially harvested freshwater fish species. The authors argue that such dynamics are likely occurring widely.Science, this issue p. 620; see also p. 566Invertebrate declines are widespread in terrestrial ecosystems, and pesticide use is often cited as a causal factor. Here, we report that aquatic systems are threatened by the high toxicity and persistence of neonicotinoid insecticides. These effects cascade to higher trophic levels by altering food web structure and dynamics, affecting higher-level consumers. Using data on zooplankton, water quality, and annual fishery yields of eel and smelt, we show that neonicotinoid application to watersheds since 1993 coincided with an 83\% decrease in average zooplankton biomass in spring, causing the smelt harvest to collapse from 240 to 22 tons in Lake Shinji, Shimane Prefecture, Japan. This disruption likely also occurs elsewhere, as neonicotinoids are currently the most widely used class of insecticides globally.},

Dispersal has long been assumed to homogenise populations in structured landscapes by generating maladapted gene flows, making spatial heterogeneity of phenotypes traditionally considered resulting from local adaptation or plasticity. However, there is accumulating evidence that individuals, instead of dispersing randomly in the landscapes, adjust their dispersal decisions according to their phenotype and the environmental conditions. Specifically, individuals might move in the landscape to find and settle in the environmental conditions that best match their phenotype, therefore maximizing their fitness, a hypothesis named habitat matching. Although habitat matching and associated non-random gene flows can produce spatial phenotypic heterogeneity, their potential consequences for metapopulation and metacommunity functioning are still poorly understood. Here, we discuss evidence for intra and interspecific drivers of habitat matching, and highlight the potential consequences of this process for metapopulation and metacommunity functioning. We conclude that habitat matching might deeply affect the eco-evolutionary dynamics of meta-systems, pointing out the need for further empirical and theoretical research on its incidence and implications for species and communities evolution under environmental changes.},

Results showed an increase in genetic diversity and a twofold decrease in the extent of genetic differentiation among stocked populations when compared to unstocked. Stocked populations were characterized by significant admixture at both population and individual levels. Moreover, levels of admixture in stocked populations were strongly correlated with stocking intensity and a threshold value of total homogenization between source and stocked populations was identified. Our results also suggest that under certain scenarios, the genetic impacts of stocking could be of short duration.

	abstract = {Abstract Parasites are more diverse and numerous than their hosts and commonly control population dynamics. Whether parasites also regulate key ecosystem processes, such as resistance to climate stress, is unclear. In southern U.S. salt marshes, drought interacts synergistically with keystone grazing to generate extensive ecosystem die-off. Field manipulations of parasite prevalence and salt stress in sediments in healthy marshes demonstrated that trematode parasites, by suppressing feeding activity of grazers that overgraze on drought-stressed plants, have the potential to slow the rate of ecosystem loss. Surveys along 1,000 km of coastline during an intense drought event revealed parasitism is common in grazers on die-off borders and that increasing infection prevalence along marsh die-off borders is negatively correlated with per capita grazing. Combined, results from this field experiment and survey suggested, but did not show, that parasites could affect rates of drought-driven salt marsh die-off. To test whether parasites can indeed protect marshes under real drought conditions, we experimentally manipulated parasite prevalence in grazers over a month-long period on active die-off borders in three North Carolina marshes. Experimentally reducing parasite prevalence markedly increased the rate of plant ecosystem decline, an effect that scaled positively with prevalence. Thus parasites, by generating a trophic cascade, indirectly enhanced ecosystem resistance to overgrazing under intense drought in these North Carolina marshes. The generality of these results across the entire range of this keystone grazer in the southeastern United States needs to be tested, employing both experiments and extensive surveys that examine how the rate of ecosystem decline is mediated by parasitism. Given the ubiquity of parasites in ecosystems, our results suggest that more research effort should be invested in examining the possible roles for parasitism in regulating ecosystem function and stability.},

	abstract = {AbstractIn this work, Grinnellian niche theory (a body of theory about geographic distributions of species in terms of noninteracting niche variables) is used to demonstrate that species-area relationships emerge with both size of environmental space and size of geographic area. As environmental space increases, more species’ fundamental niches are included, thus increasing the number of species capable of living in the corresponding region. This idea is made operational by proposing a size measure for multidimensional environmental space and approximating fundamental niches with minimum volume ellipsoids. This framework allows estimating a presence-absence matrix based on the distribution of fundamental niches in environmental space, from which many biodiversity measures can be calculated, such as beta diversity. I establish that Whittaker’s equation for beta diversity is equivalent to MacArthur’s formula relating species numbers and niche breadth; this latter equation provides a mechanism for the species–niche space relationship. I illustrate the theoretical results via exploration of niches of the terrestrial mammals of North America (north of Panama). Each world region has a unique structure of its environmental space, and the position of fundamental niches in niche space is different for different clades; therefore, species-area relationships depend on the clades involved and the region of focus, mostly as a function of MacArthur’s niche beta diversity. Analyzing species-area relationships from the perspective of niche position in environmental space is novel, shifting emphasis from demographic processes to historical, geographic, and climatic factors; moreover, the Grinnellian approach is based on available data and is computationally feasible.},

In contrast to widespread assumptions, the relationship between body size and trophic level of consumers—from protists to large vertebrates—was not significant per se but varied among ecosystem types and animal groups. The correlation between body size and trophic level was strong in marine consumers, weak in freshwater consumers, and absent in terrestrial consumers, which was also observed at the scale of local food webs. Vertebrates occupied higher trophic positions than invertebrates, and green trophic chains were longer than brown ones in aquatic (primarily marine) but not in terrestrial food webs. Variations in body size of top predators suggest that terrestrial and many freshwater food webs are size compartmentalized, implying different trophic dynamics and responses to perturbations than in size-structured marine food webs.},

Optimal foraging theory (OFT) has previously been applied to understand the emergence of food-web structure through a consumer-centric consideration of diet choice. However, the resource-centric viewpoint, where species adjust their behaviour to reduce the risk of predation, has not been considered. We develop a mechanistic model that merges metabolic theory with OFT to incorporate the effect of predation risk on diet choice to assemble food webs. This ‘predation-risk-compromise’ (PR) model better captures the nestedness and modularity of empirical food webs relative to the classical optimal foraging model. Specifically, compared with optimal foraging alone, risk-mitigated foraging leads to more-nested but less-modular webs by broadening the diet of consumers at intermediate trophic levels. Thus, predation risk significantly affects food-web structure by constraining species’ ability to forage optimally, and needs to be considered in future work.},

Our method eliminates these two assumptions. In addition, the method can also accommodate mortality during a sampling period. This new method uses integrodifference equations to express the probability of spatial mark-recapture data; associated dispersal, survival, and recapture parameters are then estimated using a maximum likelihood method.

	abstract = {A key challenge for community ecology is to understand to what extent observational data can be used to infer the underlying community assembly processes. As different processes can lead to similar or even identical patterns, statistical analyses of non-manipulative observational data never yield undisputable causal inference on the underlying processes. Still, most empirical studies in community ecology are based on observational data, and hence understanding under which circumstances such data can shed light on assembly processes is a central concern for community ecologists. We simulated a spatial agent-based model that generates variation in metacommunity dynamics across multiple axes, including the four classic metacommunity paradigms as special cases. We further simulated a virtual ecologist who analysed snapshot data sampled from the simulations using eighteen output metrics derived from beta-diversity and habitat variation indices, variation partitioning and joint species distribution modelling. Our results indicated two main axes of variation in the output metrics. The first axis of variation described whether the landscape has patchy or continuous variation, and thus was essentially independent of the properties of the species community. The second axis of variation related to the level of predictability of the metacommunity. The most predictable communities were niche-based metacommunities inhabiting static landscapes with marked environmental heterogeneity, such as metacommunities following the species sorting paradigm or the mass effects paradigm. The most unpredictable communities were neutral-based metacommunities inhabiting dynamics landscapes with little spatial heterogeneity, such as metacommunities following the neutral or patch sorting paradigms. The output metrics from joint species distribution modelling yielded generally the highest resolution to disentangle among the simulated scenarios. Yet, the different types of statistical approaches utilized in this study carried complementary information, and thus our results suggest that the most comprehensive evaluation of metacommunity structure can be obtained by combining them.},

	abstract = {Species can persist when the environment changes by shifting their ranges through dispersal or by adapting to the new conditions that they experience. Thus, we might expect that dispersal and adaptation in combination would increase persistence. Using a simulation model, we show that this may not be the case. Instead, species competition causes dispersal and adaptation to have conflicting contributions to biodiversity maintenance. Dispersal and adaptation each independently increase biodiversity maintenance. But when species both disperse and evolve, faster adapting species persist in their current ranges, preventing others from shifting their ranges to track environmental change. These findings highlight the need to consider ecological and evolutionary processes together, or we risk underestimating how global change will impact biodiversity.Dispersal and adaptation both allow species to persist in changing environments. Yet, we have limited understanding of how these processes interact to affect species persistence, especially in diverse communities where biotic interactions greatly complicate responses to environmental change. Here we use a stochastic metacommunity model to demonstrate how dispersal and adaptation to environmental change independently and interactively contribute to biodiversity maintenance. Dispersal provides spatial insurance, whereby species persist on the landscape by shifting their distributions to track favorable conditions. In contrast, adaptation allows species to persist by allowing for evolutionary rescue. But, when species both adapt and disperse, dispersal and adaptation do not combine positively to affect biodiversity maintenance, even if they do increase the persistence of individual species. This occurs because faster adapting species evolve to hold onto their initial ranges (i.e., monopolization effects), thus impeding slower adapting species from shifting their ranges and thereby causing extinctions. Importantly, these differences in adaptation speed emerge as the result of competition, which alters population sizes and colonization success. By demonstrating how dispersal and adaptation each independently and interactively contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity, we provide a framework that links the theories of spatial insurance, evolutionary rescue, and monopolization. This highlights the expectation that the maintenance of biodiversity in changing environments depends jointly on rates of dispersal and adaptation, and, critically, the interaction between these processes.},

We examined these hypotheses using movement data from four populations of migratory mule deer (n = 91). Spatial memory had an extraordinary influence on migration, affecting movement 2–28 times more strongly than tracking spring green-up or autumn snow depth. Importantly, with only an ability to track resources, simulated deer were unable to recreate empirical migratory routes. In contrast, simulated deer with memory of empirical routes used those routes and obtained higher foraging benefits. For migratory terrestrial mammals, spatial memory provides knowledge of where seasonal ranges and migratory routes exist, whereas resource tracking determines when to beneficially move within those areas.},

To evaluate its utility, we should verify that such ‘bioacoustics’ can accurately detect ecological signal in spatiotemporal acoustic data. Targeting the ‘Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project’ sites in Brazil, we ask: What is the relative contribution of the spatial, temporal and habitat dimension to variation in bird acoustic communities in a previously fragmented tropical rainforest? Does the functional diversity of bird communities scale similarly to space and time as does species diversity, when both are recorded by bioacoustics means? Overall, is the imprint of landscape fragmentation 30 years ago still audible in the present-day soundscape? We sampled forty-four sites in secondary forest and 107 sites in old-growth forest, resulting in 11 000 h of audio recordings. We detected 60 bird species with satisfactory precision and recovered a linear log–log relation between sampling time and species diversity. Sites in primary forest host more species than sites in secondary forest, but the difference decreased with sampling time, as the slope was slightly higher in secondary than primary forests. Functional diversity, as exposed by vocalizing birds, accumulates faster than does species diversity. The similarity among local communities decreases with distance in both time and space, but stability in time is remarkably high: two acoustic samples from the same site one year (or more) apart prove more similar than two samples taken at the same time but from sites situated just a few hundred meters apart. These findings suggest that habitat modification can be heard as a long-lasting imprint on the soundscape of regenerating habitats and identify soundscape–area and soundscape–time relations as a promising tool for biodiversity research, applied biomonitoring and restoration ecology.},

	abstract = {Abstract Enhancing our understanding of fish dispersal is central to the success of modern-day conservation efforts in freshwater ecosystems. However, methods seeking to estimate dispersal are diverse; ranging from direct estimation of individual movements, computation of dispersal kernels, to indirect assessment using measures of gene flow across riverscapes. An important question is whether results from these different approaches provide a consistent picture of the spatial scales of dispersal. Here, we performed a review and meta-analysis of the literature reporting both individual movements and genetic data to characterize patterns of dispersal for riverine fishes globally. Across all the studies considered (Ndirect = 206; Nindirect = 205), our results suggest restricted magnitudes of dispersal for riverine fishes, but highlight a large heterogeneity among species, taxonomic orders and geographies. For instance, we found that the maximum parent–offspring dispersal distances varied from 69 m to 1,086 km (median = 12 km; Nspecies = 107), whereas the dispersal spread derived from isolation-by-distance slopes (σIBD) from genetic data ranged from 19 m to 250 km (median = 1 km; Nspecies = 56). Comparisons of species-specific values also revealed significant and positive relationships between direct and indirect estimates of dispersal distances, indicating that organismal movement ability often translates into effective transmission of genes. Finally, this global overview pointed to important geographic and taxonomic disparities in the study of dispersal for riverine fishes. We thus encourage researchers to broaden the taxonomic and geographical scope of future investigations and identify emerging research frontiers where new scientific efforts are needed.},

	doi = {10.1002/ecy.2719},
	abstract = {Abstract Because natural ecosystems are complex, it is difficult to predict how their variability scales across space and levels of organization. The species-insurance hypothesis predicts that asynchronous dynamics among species should reduce variability when biomass is aggregated either from local species populations to local multispecies communities, or from metapopulations to metacommunities. Similarly, the spatial-insurance hypothesis predicts that asynchronous spatial dynamics among either local populations or local communities should stabilize metapopulation biomass and metacommunity biomass, respectively. In combination, both species and spatial insurance reduce variation in metacommunity biomass over time, yet these insurances are rarely considered together in natural systems. We partitioned the extent that species insurance and spatial insurance reduced the annual variation in macroalgal biomass in a southern California kelp forest. We quantified variability and synchrony at two levels of organization (population and community) and two spatial scales (local plots and region) and quantified the strength of species and spatial insurance by comparing observed variability and synchrony in aggregate biomass to null models of independent species or spatial dynamics based on cyclic-shift permutation. Spatial insurance was weak, presumably because large-scale oceanographic processes in the study region led to high spatial synchrony at both population- and community-level biomass. Species insurance was stronger due to asynchronous dynamics among the metapopulations of a few common species. In particular, a regional decline in the dominant understory kelp species Pterygophora californica was compensated for by the rise of three subdominant species. These compensatory dynamics were associated with positive values of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, indicating that differential species tolerances to warmer temperature and nutrient-poor conditions may underlie species insurance in this system. Our results illustrate how species insurance can stabilize aggregate community properties in natural ecosystems where environmental conditions vary over broad spatial scales.},

The beneficial effects of phenotypic variability are strongest when there are substantial differences among phenotypes and when phenotypes are inherited with moderately high fidelity; yet even low levels of variation lead to significant increases in diversity, stability, and robustness.

We find that both species types contribute to the recovery of communities following generic perturbations (i.e. perturbations affecting all species). Yet, when perturbations are selective (i.e. affects only one species), perturbations to rare species have the most pronounced effect on community stability. We show that this is due to the strong indirect effects induced by perturbations to rare species. Because indirect effects typically set in at longer timescales, our results indicate that the importance of rare species may be easily overlooked and thus underrated.

Research and monitoring of its impacts are generally lacking, and the usefulness of hatchery release for fisheries and conservation objectives is unclear. Here, I evaluated positive and negative impacts of worldwide marine stock enhancement and sea ranching programmes in a systematic review associated with meta-analyses with the goal of reducing bias of the review. Vast numbers of individuals of more than 180 species are released into the wild each year, but most studies are at experimental stages to assess its potential, and empirical studies are sparse for evaluating the impact on fishery production. Most cases are economically unprofitable except for a few successful cases or unevaluated. The effects of releasing juveniles can be dwarfed by the magnitude of natural recruitment when the spawning stock produces much larger recruitment than released juveniles. Density-dependent growth caused by competition of food can be substantial, and growth rates of hatchery and wild fish and other competitive species can simultaneously be reduced when stocking exceeded the carrying capacity. Relative reproductive success can vary depending on the species, seed quality and environmental factors. Empirical studies show evidence of substantial gene flow from hatcheries, but fitness reduction in stocked populations has not been reported. The results represent the current state of worldwide marine stock enhancement and sea ranching activity and provide key information for growing fields of artificial propagation and conservation.},

Despite making no a priori assumptions regarding biotic spatial structure or the distribution of biomass across species, model metacommunities self-organise to reproduce well-documented patterns including characteristic species abundance distributions, range size distributions and species area relations. Also in agreement with observations, species richness in our model attains an equilibrium despite continuous species turnover. Crucially, it is in the neighbourhood of the equilibrium that we observe the emergence of these key macroecological patterns. Biodiversity equilibria in models occur due to the onset of ecological structural instability, a population-dynamical mechanism.

This article reviews and unifies previous work on this phenomenon. Some discrete models of density-dependent growth were shown to exhibit hydra effects in 1954, but the topic was then ignored for decades. Here the history of research on the hydra effect is reviewed, and the key factors producing it are explored. Mortality that precedes overcompensatory density dependence always has the potential to produce hydra effects. Even when mortality follows density dependence, hydra effects may occur in unstable systems due to changes in the amplitude and/or form of population cycles. An increase in resource productivity due to lower consumption rates following increased consumer mortality can also produce a hydra effect. Lower consumption can come about as the result of increased satiation of the consumers or changes in behaviour of either consumer or resource species that reduce the mean attack rate. Changes in species composition of a resource community may also decrease the average attack rate. Population structure can promote hydra effects by allowing separation of the timing of density dependence and mortality, although stage-specific density dependence usually decreases hydra effects.},

Marine growth was estimated using scales collected from 11 760 adults of age 0.3 (1980–2004). The growth and survival of each stock appeared to have a different suite of regulatory processes. Interannual variability in return rates was mainly regulated by size at release in two stocks from the Sea of Okhotsk. A similar relationship was found in one stock from the Sea of Japan, but growth during coastal residency also affected their return rates. In two stocks from the Pacific coast of Hokkaido, variability in return rates was not related to size at release or to the coastal growth of juveniles, but with offshore growth in the Sea of Okhotsk, the nursery area for juveniles after leaving Japanese coastal waters. Whereas coastal growth tended to be negatively correlated with size at release in some stocks, offshore growth was positively associated with the August–November sea surface temperature in all stocks. This study confirmed that mortality of juvenile salmon occurred in two phases, during the coastal residency and the late period of the growing season, but the relative importance of both phases varied by stock and region, which probably regulated year-class strength of Hokkaido chum salmon.},

Here, we couple multi-host preference experiments with a novel model of vector preference general to both single and multi-host communities. We show that viruliferous aphids exhibit strong preferences for healthy and long-lived hosts. Coupling experimental results with modelling to account for preference leads to a strong decrease in overall pathogen spread through multi-host communities due to non-random sorting of viruliferous vectors between preferred and non-preferred host species.

Complex interactions among species have rarely been explored in such studies. We extend network theory to the analysis of complex patterns of co-occurrence among species. The framework is used to explore the robustness of networks under climate change. With our data, we show that networks describing the geographic pattern of co-occurrence among species display properties shared by other complex networks, namely that most species are poorly connected to other species in the network and only a few are highly connected. In our example, species more exposed to climate change tended to be poorly connected to other species within the network, while species more connected tended to be less exposed. Such high connectance would make the co-occurrence networks more robust to climate change. The proposed framework illustrates how network analysis could be used, together with co-occurrence data, to help addressing the potential consequences of species interactions in studies of climate change and biodiversity. However, more research is needed to test for links between co-occurrence and network interactions.},

Functional structure was largely driven by inherent altitudinal variation influencing and cascading to regional scaled factors such as land use change and position in the riverine network, which, in turn, transformed local habitat structure variables. Those cascading effects across scales propagated through the biotic community, first affecting prey and, in turn, predators. Our results illustrate how seemingly less important local factors can act as essential transmission belts, propagating through direct and indirect pathways across scales to generate the specific context in which each functional group will strive or not, leading to characteristic landscape wide variations in functional community structure.},

We perturbed an empirical sagebrush steppe community model to remove the demographic effect of niche differences and quantify their impact on coexistence. With stabilizing mechanisms operating, all species showed positive growth rates when rare, generating stable coexistence. Fluctuation-independent mechanisms contributed more than temporal variability to coexistence and operated more strongly on recruitment than growth or survival. As expected, removal of stabilizing niche differences led to extinction of all inferior competitors. However, complete exclusion required 300–400 years, indicating small fitness differences among species. Our results show an ‘excess’ of niche differences: stabilizing mechanisms were not only strong enough to maintain diversity but were much stronger than necessary given the small fitness differences. The diversity of this community cannot be understood without consideration of niche differences.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of ecosystem responses to exceedingly large rare flood events is currently limited. We report the resilience of aquatic community to a 100-year record-high flood, and how it varies depending on levels of water pollution, in a fourth-order gravel-bed river in northern Japan. We used data on riparian landscape structure, channel morphology, and community structure of aquatic fauna, which were collected in sites with and without effluent before (1 month–3 years) and after (10 months) the flood. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of consumers and basal resources were measured only before (1 year) the flood. We observed aquatic food web with introduced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as the top predator, with variable relative contributions of basal resources and their pathways to the rainbow trout, under the effects of water pollution. Biofilm-originating dietary carbon became the more dominant resource, with a slightly shorter food-chain length in the polluted sites. The flood led to a loss of riparian forest and a substantial increase in the proportion of exposed gravel bars (5–24\%). While the average river-bed elevation changed a little, the localized scours of river bed down to {\textgreater} 2 m were observed with lateral shifts of channel thalweg. Despite the landscape-level physical and structural changes of ecosystem, aquatic community showed a remarkably high resilience exhibiting negligible changes in abundance, except in the polluted site where only fish abundance showed a slight decrease. This study suggests that the abundance of aquatic organisms in gravel-bed rivers is resilient to a flood of unprecedented magnitude in recent history.},

Although most previous research assumed competition as major local species interactions, growing empirical evidence suggests that facilitation is also an important driver of local community dynamics. Here, I explore how facilitation affects the shape of local-regional richness relationships, by incorporating local facilitation into a patch-occupancy model of metacommunity dynamics. I find that facilitation can generate local-regional richness relationships with the alternative stable states of mean local richness at intermediate to high levels of regional richness. These alternative stable states tend to occur in a metacommunity in moderately harsh environments. This result cautions against assuming that only competition can be primarily important local interactions when interpreting the shapes of local-regional richness relationships. Moreover, the possibility of alternative stable states suggests that gradual decline of regional species diversity might cause a sudden collapse of metacommunities with local facilitation.},

We examined (i) the species composition and habitat availability (e.g., water temperature and velocity) in reaches along an altitudinal gradient (elevation: 0–270 m, gradient: 0.6–11\%), (ii) microhabitat use at the individual level, and (iii) swimming stamina against a fixed water flow velocity using stamina tunnel tests in the Ohkamaya River, Hokkaido, Japan. The proportion of white-spotted charr increased in an upstream direction from 5 to 95\%, whereas summer water temperature and average velocity increased downstream (temperature: 15–18°C, velocity: 17–40 cm s−1). Underwater observations revealed that white-spotted charr used slow velocity microhabitat more than masu salmon under sympatric and allopatric conditions (charr: 7–13 cm s−1, salmon: 15–23 cm s−1). Masu salmon swam twice as long as white-spotted charr against a fixed-velocity (66 cm s−1).

Conspicuous colour patterns have been shown effective as warning signals, by promoting predator learning and memory. Unexpectedly, some butterfly species from the unpalatable tribe Ithomiini possess transparent wings, a feature rare on land but common in water, known to reduce predator detection. We tested whether transparency of butterfly wings was associated with decreased detectability by predators, by comparing four butterfly species exhibiting different degrees of transparency, ranging from fully opaque to largely transparent. We tested our prediction using both wild birds and humans in behavioural experiments. Vision modelling predicted butterfly detectability to be similar for these two predator types. In concordance with predictions, the most transparent species were almost never found first and were detected less often than the opaque species by both birds and humans, suggesting that transparency enhances crypsis. However, humans were able to learn to better detect the more transparent species over time. Our study demonstrates for the first time that transparency on land likely decreases detectability by visual predators. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

	abstract = {We examined the importance of temporal variability in top–down and bottom–up effects on the accumulation of stream periphyton, which are complex associations of autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms. Periphyton contributes to primary production and nutrient cycling and serves as a food resource for herbivores (grazers). Periphyton growth is often limited by the availability of nitrogen and phosphorus, and biomass can be controlled by grazers. In this study we experimentally manipulated nutrients and grazers simultaneously to determine the relative contribution of bottom–up and top–down controls on periphyton over time. We used nutrient diffusing substrates to regulate nutrient concentrations and an underwater electric field to exclude grazing insects in three sequential 16–17 day experiments from August to October in montane Colorado, USA. We measured algal biomass, periphyton organic mass, and algal community composition in each experiment and determined densities of streambed insect species, including grazers. Phosphorus was the primary limiting nutrient for algal biomass, but it did not influence periphyton organic mass across all experiments. Effects of nutrient additions on algal biomass and community composition decreased between August and October. Grazed substrates supported reduced periphyton biomass only in the first experiment, corresponding to high benthic abundances of a dominant mayfly grazer (Rhithrogena spp.). Grazed substrates in the first experiment also showed altered algal community composition with reduced diatom relative abundances, presumably in response to selective grazing. We showed that top–down grazing effects were strongest in late summer when grazers were abundant. The effects of phosphorus additions on algal biomass likely decreased over time because temperature became more limiting to growth than nutrients, and because reduced current velocity decreased nutrient uptake rates. These results suggest that investigators should proceed with caution when extending findings based on short-term experiments. Furthermore, these results support the need for additional seasonal-scale field research in stream ecology.},

In whole-ecosystem manipulations of small Caribbean islands on which brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) were the native top predator, we experimentally staged invasions by competitors (green anoles, Anolis smaragdinus) and/or new top predators (curly-tailed lizards, Leiocephalus carinatus). We show that curly-tailed lizards destabilized the coexistence of competing prey species, contrary to the classic idea of keystone predation. Fear-driven avoidance of predators collapsed the spatial and dietary niche structure that otherwise stabilized coexistence, which intensified interspecific competition within predator-free refuges and contributed to the extinction of green-anole populations on two islands. Moreover, whereas adding either green anoles or curly-tailed lizards lengthened food chains on the islands, adding both species reversed this effect—in part because the apex predators were trophic omnivores. Our results underscore the importance of top-down control in ecological communities, but show that its outcomes depend on prey behaviour, spatial structure, and omnivory. Diversity-enhancing effects of top predators cannot be assumed, and non-consumptive effects of predation risk may be a widespread constraint on species coexistence.},

Still, we know little about how warming affects these feedbacks. Using a dynamic stage-structured biomass model with food-, size- and temperature-dependent life history processes, we analyse how temperature affects coexistence, stability and size structure in a tri-trophic food chain, and find that warming effects on community stability depend on ecological interactions. Predator biomass densities generally decline with warming – gradually or through collapses – depending on which consumer life stage predators feed on. Collapses occur when warming induces alternative stable states via Allee effects. This suggests that predator persistence in warmer climates may be lower than previously acknowledged and that effects of warming on food web stability largely depend on species interactions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Modeling the dynamics of competition and coexistence between species is crucial to predict long-term impacts of invasive species on their native congeners. However, natural environments are often fragmented and variable in time and space. In such contexts, regional coexistence depends on complex interactions between competition, niche differentiation and stochastic colonization–extinction dynamics. Quantifying all these processes at landscape scale has always been a challenge for ecologists. We propose a new statistical framework to evaluate metapopulation parameters (colonization and extinction) in a two-species system and how they respond to environmental variables and interspecific competition. It requires spatial surveys repeated in time, but does not assume demographic equilibrium. We apply this model to a long-term survey of two snails inhabiting a network of freshwater habitats in the West Indies. We find evidence of reciprocal competition affecting colonization or extinction rates, modulated by species-specific sensitivity to environmental variables. Simulations using model estimates allow us to predict species dynamics and explore the role of various coexistence mechanisms described by metacommunity theory in our system. The two species are predicted to stably coexist, because niche partitioning, source–sink dynamics and interspecific differences in extinction–colonization parameters all contribute to reduce the negative impacts of competition. However, none of these mechanisms is individually essential. Regional coexistence is primarily facilitated by transient co-occurrence of the two species within habitat patches, a possibility generally not considered in theoretical metacommunity models. Our framework is general and could be extended to guilds of several competing species.},

	abstract = {Abstract Population dynamics models have long assumed that populations are composed of a restricted number of groups, where individuals in each group have identical demographic rates and where all groups are similarly affected by density-dependent and -independent effects. However, individuals usually vary tremendously in performance and in their sensitivity to environmental conditions or resource limitation, such that individual contributions to population growth will be highly variable. Recent efforts to integrate individual processes in population models open up new opportunities for the study of eco-evolutionary processes, such as the density-dependent influence of environmental conditions on the evolution of morphological, behavioral, and life-history traits. We review recent advances that demonstrate how including individual mechanisms in models of population dynamics contributes to a better understanding of the drivers of population dynamics within the framework of integrated population models (IPMs). IPMs allow for the integration in a single inferential framework of different data types as well as variable population structure including sex, social group, or territory, all of which can be formulated to include individual-level processes. Through a series of examples, we first show how IPMs can be beneficial for getting more accurate estimates of demographic traits than classic matrix population models by including basic population structure and their influence on population dynamics. Second, the integration of individual- and population-level data allows estimating density-dependent effects along with their inherent uncertainty by directly using the population structure and size to feedback on demography. Third, we show how IPMs can be used to study the influence of the dynamics of continuous individual traits and individual quality on population dynamics. We conclude by discussing the benefits and limitations of IPMs for integrating data at different spatial, temporal, and organismal levels to build more mechanistic models of population dynamics.},

In addition, a unique gradual distribution of the two forms has been developed below the waterfall, where the frequency of iwame increases with elevation. To explore the evolutionary process of iwame in this river, the population structure and phylogenetic relationships among subspecies of O. masou were investigated through AFLP and mtDNA analyses. Bayesian admixture analysis revealed two distinct subpopulations within the Ôno River, although both shared a single mtDNA haplotype. All iwame above the waterfall, as well as 87.5 \% of iwame below the waterfall, were estimated to have pure ancestry from one subpopulation with extremely low genetic diversity, suggesting that genetic drift could account for the fixation of the markless phenotypes (i.e., disappearance of amago) in this subpopulation. The remaining iwame and most amago below the waterfall showed admixture with another subpopulation. Gene flow from an adjacent branch stream occupied only by amago into the lower part of the lower reach below the waterfall may contribute to the maintenance of the gradual distribution of the two forms. Phylogenetic analysis based on AFLP data revealed that iwame were independently derived from amago in different river systems (i.e., polyphyletic). The present results may provide a framework for genetic management to prevent further loss of genetic diversity in the unique Ôno River iwame.},

	abstract = {Abstract Populations optimize the match of phenotype to environment by localized natural selection, adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and habitat choice. Habitat choice may also be achieved by several mechanisms, including matching habitat choice, where individuals distribute themselves based on self-assessment of the phenotype–environment match. Matching habitat choice is a relatively untested concept, but one that could advance our understanding of the interplay of movement ecology and intraspecific phenotypic variation. Morphology of the salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus differs in riffles and pools, the dominant habitats in headwater streams where this species occurs. Specifically, individuals found in riffles have shorter limbs than those found in pools. Here, we used 4 yr of spatially explicit capture–mark–recapture data from three streams to test the contributions of phenotypic plasticity and matching habitat choice to this phenotype–environment covariation. We quantified morphological variation in G. porphyriticus with size-corrected principal component (PC) scores and assessed phenotype–environment match based on the difference between habitats in these PC scores. We found that both phenotypic plasticity and matching habitat choice contribute to phenotype–environment covariation in G. porphyriticus. The phenotypes of individuals that switched habitats (i.e., riffle→pool, pool→riffle) changed to become better matched to the recipient habitat, indicating a plastic response to local habitat conditions. Consistent with matching habitat choice, individuals were also more likely to switch habitats if their initial phenotype was a better match to the alternative habitat, independent of subsequent changes in morphology due to plasticity. Realized performance, survival adjusted for the likelihood of remaining in each habitat, was higher in individuals with phenotypes matched to each habitat than in those with mismatched phenotypes, but performance was generally lower in riffles than pools, suggesting that other factors influence the use of riffles. Our results underscore the value of considering how matching habitat choice interacts with other mechanisms that allow organisms to maximize performance when faced with environmental heterogeneity. More broadly, our study shows that it is important to account for movement in any study of the causes or consequences of intraspecific trait variation, a challenge that may require novel research approaches and experimental designs.},

We show that use of a discrete-time model that preserves seasonal reproduction, whether stage-structured or non-stage-structured, always produces equilibria that are locally stable, whereas use of a continuous-time predator–prey model with an instantaneous approximation of seasonal reproduction can produce a limit cycle (self-sustained population fluctuations). This difference in dynamics results from the mismatch of life history properties between the mathematical model and the biological system under the continuous time model. We conclude that seasonal reproduction may be an important stabilizing factor in predator–prey interactions. Finally, with stage-structured predator–prey models, we show how life history parameters affect asymptotic dynamics of the system. Discrete-time models provide a more natural match to the biology of these systems.

	abstract = {Abstract Invasive nonindigenous species are defined by their impacts: they substantially change native communities or ecosystems. Accordingly, invasive species might transform their habitats in ways that eventually become unfavorable to them, causing population declines or even extirpations. Here we use over 40 yr of systematically collected data on the abundance of the invasive rusty crayfish Faxonius rusticus from 17 lakes in northern Wisconsin, USA to explore whether population declines of this invader are related to the prevalence of rocky habitat, which shelters crayfish from predators and is unchanged by crayfish. We predicted that lakes with rock-dominated substrates would be resistant to F. rusticus population declines, whereas lakes lacking rock-dominated substrates would experience F. rusticus declines due to crayfish destruction of shelter-providing macrophytes. We found that in nearly one-half (47\%) of the study lakes, F. rusticus experienced population declines over the study time period, and these lakes had significantly lower proportions of rock substrate than lakes that did not experience population declines. We recommend that more studies should investigate the potential for invasive species-mediated community or ecosystem feedbacks to eventually contribute to their own population declines.},

	abstract = {Abstract Identifying cross-scale patterns of ecological processes is imperative, especially in hierarchically structured riverine ecosystems. The role of abiotic factors in determining cross-scale spatial structure of stream fish populations and communities is well studied, but less is known about how species traits drive cross-scale patterns. We investigated the role of species traits for explaining autocorrelation of stream fish abundance at spatial scales ranging from local stream reaches to major basins. We calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) representing abundance autocorrelation within species (N = 47) at each of five spatial scales. A hierarchical Bayesian regression then modelled ICCs against spatial scale with the resulting regression coefficients modelled as functions of species traits. Finally, we ordinated the scale-by-species ICC matrix to calculate an overall metric describing species whose abundances were autocorrelated along a gradient of large to small scales, and modelled this metric as a function of species traits. Abundances of most species were autocorrelated at smaller spatial scales. Maximum fecundity had a significant positive relationship with abundance patterns across spatial scales. Species habitat affinities and body forms were significantly associated with overall abundance patterns across spatial scales: populations of upland/lotic-affiliated species adapted to streams with high flow correlated at small (≤10 km2) spatial scales. Lowland/lacustrine species with laterally compressed bodies showed little correlation across scales. The appropriate spatial scale for modelling abundance is determined not only by exogenous (e.g. environmental) factors, but also endogenous factors, like traits. Careful consideration of traits and life history will aid researchers in designing more effective and efficient surveys and analyses.},

	abstract = {Abstract Foodweb analyses can provide insight as to how species persist in naturally dynamic environments and how these communities may respond to anthropogenic alteration. In the remaining undammed rivers of the arid southwestern United States, it is thought that plasticity in feeding behavior allows native fishes to thrive in the context of natural fluctuations in temperature, sediment, and resource availability associated with extreme swings in season and hydrology. There have been few evaluations of this hypothesis, in part owing to the rarity of rivers that retain their natural environmental dynamics and complement of native species. We investigated the feeding ecology of the fish assemblage of one such river, the Little Colorado River, Arizona, focusing on four native species: bluehead sucker (Catostomus discobolus), flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis), speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus), and endangered humpback chub (Gila cypha). Over two years, we sampled fish diets in July, September, January, March, and June, encompassing turbid and clear-water conditions across seasons. We quantified food resource contributions to fish diets in fish-centered food webs, comparing diversity of trophic linkages and linkage-strength distribution across time. We used ordination analyses to investigate differences in diets among species and changes in diet composition across seasons and conducted seasonal comparisons of gut fullness. We observed a high diversity of dietary items (as absolute numbers and consumer–resource ratios) within a fish assemblage that was apparently resistant to extreme and recurrent environmental variability. Fish diet diversity was {\textasciitilde}2× that of the nearby dammed Colorado River's tailwater, and over 50\% of fish-resource linkages were weak ({\textless}1\% of species’ diet). Native fishes consumed a mix of terrestrial and aquatic resources. Notably, the water column-feeding humpback chub consumed the largest percentage of terrestrially derived food items and appeared to capitalize on food resources made available by a summer flash flood, consuming twice as much during this flood than during other seasons (based on gut fullness, corrected by estimates of food quality). Other fishes exhibited similar dietary variation. Such opportunist/generalist strategies, coupled with diverse food resources, may be important to the persistence of these and other native fishes in dynamic environments.},

Despite higher density and biomass, epilithic algae did not make large contributions to aquatic consumers due to the restriction of flow velocity, water depth and turbidity. Aquatic invertebrates specialized in utilization of terrestrial carbon sources, whereas fish varied from aquatic to riparian plants. Different resource use of aquatic consumers across the three reaches in the Irtysh River was ascribed to the spatial distribution of species and resource availability determined by flooding, flood scouring and dam construction. The trophic positions and food chain length at the upper reach were higher than those at the middle and lower reaches. These findings suggest that allochthonous carbon had an advantage over autochthonous carbon in supporting aquatic food webs of the Irtysh River. Higher availability of allochthonous particulate carbon might be relevant to intensive forest cover and high energy flood events in the Irtysh River.},

Statistical comparisons of isotopic niche space among functional groups suggested that macroinvertebrates obtained dietary C from both instream and riparian (terrestrial) sources and were more broadly dispersed in isotopic space than were fishes. Macroinvertebrates that fed on riparian sources were less likely to be consumed by fishes. Baseline isotopic ratios changed in nonlinear fashion across sites, as did isotopic values of local consumers, and maximum food-chain lengths. The Rio Grande food web appears to be controlled predominantly at the reach scale by point-source effects related to inflow from tributaries, dams, and wastewater return.},

	abstract = {Abstract Artificial lighting at night (ALAN) is a global phenomenon that can be detrimental to organisms at individual and population levels, yet potential consequences for communities and ecosystem functions are less resolved. Riparian systems may be particularly vulnerable to ALAN. We investigated the impacts of ALAN on invertebrate community composition and food web characteristics for linked aquatic-terrestrial ecosystems. We focused on food chain length (FCL), a central property of ecological communities that can influence their structure, function, and stability; and the contribution of aquatically derived energy (i.e., nutritional subsidies originating from stream periphyton). We collected terrestrial arthropods and emergent aquatic insects from a suite of stream and wetland sites in Columbus, Ohio, USA. Stable isotopes of carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N) were used to infer FCL and contribution of aquatically derived energy. We found that moderate-to-high levels of ALAN altered invertebrate community composition, favoring primarily predators and detritivores. Impacts of ALAN, however, were very taxon specific as illustrated, for example, by the negative impact of ALAN on the abundance of orb-web spiders belonging to the families Tetragnathidae and Araneidae: key invertebrate riparian predators. Most notably, we observed decreases in both invertebrate FCL and reliance on aquatically derived energy under ALAN (although aquatic energetic contributions appeared to increase again at higher levels of ALAN), in addition to shifts in the timing of reciprocal nutritional subsidies. Our study demonstrates that ALAN can alter the flows of energy between aquatic and terrestrial systems, thereby representing an environmental perturbation that can cross ecosystem boundaries. Given projections for global increases in ALAN, both in terms of coverage and intensity, these results have broad implications for stream ecosystem structure and function.},

Rivers vary widely in size, resources, and disturbance dimensions, even within the same catchment, providing an ideal platform to test ecological drivers of FCL in aquatic systems. In this study, we tested how resource availability (indicated by macroinvertebrate biomass), ecosystem size (indicated by basin area), and disturbance (indicated by daily water-level coefficients of variation) affected stable isotope-based estimates of FCL in subtropical rivers in the Province Jiangxi, China. The FCL varied widely among the studied rivers with a mean of 3.09 (range 2.00–3.99). Model-selection results indicated that resource availability could explain 60 \% of the observed variation in FCL. The FCL of the studied rivers was positively correlated with fish richness and the total area of fish community δ13C–δ15N bi-plot space, thereby indicating that an increase in fish diversity could influence the trophic structure within the food web and lead to a longer FCL. Taken together, our results suggest that resource availability could predict FCL in subtropical rivers and plays a significant role in maintaining longer FCLs by providing more energy to support upper trophic-level fishes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Large floodplain rivers in dryland regions are becoming increasingly modified through water resource developments. Identifying ecosystem responses in these systems is challenging because of their natural variability, limited data, and the myriad of ways they are modified. This study used organic samples from snail, mussel, and fish specimens obtained from museum collections for the determination of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios, for the Barwon-Darling River, Australia, between 1869 and 2005, a period of extensive water development. Three hypotheses were posed for this study: (1) The trophic status and food web character of the Barwon-Darling River will change in response to water resource developments; (2) responses in the trophic status and food web character will differ between different hydrogeomorphic zones identified along the river; and (3) food chain lengths will increase in response to water resource developments. Substantive changes in trophic status and components of the food web were detected between before and after water developments. Three lines of evidence support the conclusion of anthropogenically driven changes in the food web of this dryland floodplain-river system. Stable isotope ratios of fish, mussels, and snails differed between both hydrogeomorphic zones of the river and the before and after disturbance periods. Layman metrics, representing community niche space, differed between before and after disturbance periods. Also, both mean trophic position and food chain length differed between predisturbance and postdisturbance for the two functional process zones. The substantial shift in basal source contribution over time is a potential indicator of a state change and loss of resilience in this system.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Upper Zambezi, Kavango and Kwando are large floodplain rivers with substantial biodiversity, providing water and ecosystem services to a large tract of southern Africa. These rivers differ in hydrological regime. The Upper Zambezi and Kavango rivers are in flood for 4 months (March, April, May, June) while, in the Kwando River, floods are later and last for 1–2 months in July and August. The Upper Zambezi River has the largest annual flood pulse, followed by the Kavango River, while the Kwando River experiences small and unreliable floods. During years of exceptional flooding of the Upper Zambezi and Kavango rivers, the rivers are interconnected at peak flows and therefore share a common ichthyofauna. This provided a natural experiment to investigate the responses of fish communities comprised of the same species to differing flood regimes by comparing the fish assemblages and food-web structures between rivers. Fish assemblage structure was characterised by analysing biomass catch per unit effort data collected using gillnets in all water-level seasons for all three rivers. Whole ecosystem-stable isotope data collected once from each river were used to examine differences in food-web structure and fish feeding ecology between rivers. Due to temporal differences in hydrology, the Upper Zambezi and Kavango river food webs were characterised during the low and falling water seasons, while the Kwando River food web was sampled during the rising water season. In the Upper Zambezi and Kavango rivers, fish assemblages varied with hydrological season due to the homogenising influence of the flood pulse, while in the Kwando River fish assemblages did not change seasonally. The Upper Zambezi River food web had a restricted nitrogen range (NR = 0.90), with a reduced food chain length and predators did not occupy elevated trophic positions compared to those in the Kavango and Kwando river food webs (NR = 1.05 and 0.97 respectively). The Kwando and Kavango rivers are less exploited than the heavily fished Upper Zambezi River, where fishing has reduced the abundance of primary and tertiary consumers, potentially resulting in the observed reduction in food chain length. The Upper Zambezi and Kavango river food webs were based on differing basal resources compared to the Kwando River food web. The Upper Zambezi and Kavango river food webs were likely supported by 13C-enriched resources such as C4 riparian vegetation from the floodplain, while the Kwando River food web was likely based on 13C-depleted resources such as filamentous algae and aquatic macrophytes. The influence of the varying flood pulses on the fish communities of these three rivers supports the flood pulse concept. There is also evidence that food-web structures differ between rivers but, due to differing hydrological regimes in the rivers, further study is required to understand causal factors. These ecosystems are increasingly impacted by human population growth and development, as well as climate change, and improved predictions in fish community and food-web structure in relation to flood pulse changes are important for ecosystem management in future.},

Because proper selection of basal resources is essential, we performed stepwise model selection to decide which sources to include in the model. We estimated mean trophic level, food chain length and omnivory using a binary web (non-weighted trophic links) and a weighted web (trophic links weighted using stable isotopes). Model selection excluded macrophytes as relevant resources for the food web of this floodplain lake. In general, trophic links were relatively even, leading to similar estimations of mean trophic level and omnivory in both binary and weighted webs. Food chain length, however, was higher for the binary web, which was caused by the strong link of top predators with lower-trophic level prey in this ecosystem. Overall, the estimate of food chain length in the Paraná River was not particularly high, despite the high productivity and size of this ecosystem. We suggest that the periodical hydrological fluctuations of large rivers could be a major factor precluding the occurrence of long food chains.},

The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the relative importance of planktonic and benthic energy pathways is a major factor affecting FCL in the Middle Paraná River. Samples were obtained from in eight waterbodies, measuring chlorophyll-a concentrations and the abundance of benthic invertebrates and the trophic position of top predators by stable isotope analysis. There was no evidence that resource availability, disturbances or ecosystem size limited FCL. Similarly, the body size and trophic position of predators were not correlated. However, the relative abundance of planktonic and benthic resources was correlated with FCL. In addition, stable isotopes analysis showed that the benthic reliance of top predators is correlated with their trophic position. The results of the present study indicate that because the major benthic primary consumer is a large fish (Prochilodus lineatus), the size structure of individual food chains is an important factor determining FCL. Whereas in floodplain rivers large detritivorous fishes are targets of commercial fishing, overfishing in the Middle Paraná River could be expected to increase FCL, the opposite effect to that seen in marine environments.},

	abstract = {Multiple anthropogenic pressures including the widespread introductions of non-native species threaten biodiversity and ecosystem functioning notably by modifying the trophic structure of communities. Here, we provided a global evaluation of the impacts of non-native species on the isotopic structure (δ13C and δ15N) of freshwater fish communities. We gathered the stable isotope values (n = 4030) of fish species in 496 fish communities in lentic (lakes, backwaters, reservoirs) and lotic (running waters such as streams, rivers) ecosystems throughout the world and quantified the isotopic structure of communities. Overall, we found that communities containing non-native species had a different isotopic structure than communities without non-native species. However, these differences varied between ecosystem types and the trophic positions of non-native species. In lotic ecosystems, communities containing non-native species had a larger total isotopic niche than communities without non-native species. This was primarily driven by the addition of non-native predators at the top of the food chain that increased δ15N range without modifying the isotopic niche size of native species. In lentic ecosystems, non-native primary consumers increased δ15N range and this was likely driven by an increase of resource availability for species at higher trophic levels, increasing food chain length. The introduction of non-native secondary consumers at the centre of the isotopic niche of recipient communities decreased the core isotopic niche size, the δ13C range of recipient communities and the total isotopic niche of coexisting native species. These results suggested a modified contribution of the basal resources consumed (e.g. multi-chain omnivory) and an increase level of competition with native species. Our results notably imply that, by affecting the isotopic structure of freshwater fish communities at a global scale, non-native species represent an important source of perturbations that should be accounted for when investigating macro-ecological patterns of community structure and biotic interactions.},

	abstract = {Summary 1. Riverscapes consist of the main channel and lateral slackwater habitats along a gradient of hydrological connectivity from maximum connection in main channel habitats to minimum connection in backwaters. Spatiotemporal differences in water currents along this gradient produce dynamic habitat conditions that influence species diversity, population densities and trophic interactions of fishes. 2. We examined the importance of lateral connectivity gradients for food web dynamics in the Upper Mississippi River during spring (high flow, moderately low temperatures) and summer (low flow, higher temperatures). We used literature information and gut contents analyses to determine feeding guilds and stable isotope analysis to estimate mean trophic position of local fish assemblages. During June and August 2006, we collected over 1000 tissue samples from four habitats (main channel, secondary channels, tertiary channels and backwaters) distributed within four hydrologic connectivity gradients. 3. Mean trophic position differed among feeding guilds and seasons, with highest values in spring. Mean trophic position of fish assemblages, variability in trophic position and food chain length (maximum trophic position) of the two dominant piscivore species (Micropterus salmoides and M. dolomieu) in both seasons were significantly associated with habitat along the lateral connectivity gradient. Food chain length peaked in tertiary channels in both seasons, probably due to higher species diversity of prey at these habitats. We infer that food chain length and trophic position of fish assemblages were lower in backwater habitats in the summer mainly because of the use of alternative food sources in these habitats. 4. A greater number of conspecifics exhibited significant among-habitat variation in trophic position during the summer, indicating that low river stages can constrain fish movements in the Upper Mississippi River. 5. Results of this study should provide a better understanding of the fundamental structure of large river ecosystems and an improved basis for river rehabilitation and management through knowledge of the importance of lateral complexity in rivers.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Hydrological connectivity is an important driver of ecosystem structure in floodplain rivers; however, little is known of how hydrological connectivity affects the structure and functioning of food webs in these systems. This study examines aquatic food web structure in 10 floodplain lakes on a dryland river floodplain in eastern Australia across a connectivity gradient. Results for fishes suggest that benthic carbon sources are more important in high connectivity billabongs than in low connectivity billabongs and that pelagic sources are more important in low connectivity billabongs than in high connectivity billabongs. Fishes in less connected billabongs were also found to feed at higher trophic levels than in more connected billabongs. We hypothesize that in high connectivity billabongs, where suitable benthic primary sources are abundant, common fish species such as carp and bony bream feed as detritivores or herbivores; while in low connectivity billabongs, where benthic sources are less abundant, the same species feed as planktivores, insectivores or piscivores. This dietary difference may also be promoted by greater predation efficiency in less structurally complex low connectivity billabongs. The feeding behaviour of these fish species subsequently influences the trophic positions of fishes higher in the food chain and ultimately the total food chain lengths that high and low connectivity billabongs support. The results of this study highlight the importance of hydrological connectivity to the structure of food webs in these systems and the potential for them to be affected by water resource development.

Ecology of Freshwater Fish 2010: 19: 300–321. © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons A/S Abstract –  The upper Gila River basin is one of the few unimpounded drainage basins west of the Continental Divide, and as such is a stronghold for endemic fishes in the region. Nevertheless, multiple nonindigenous fishes potentially threaten the persistence of native fishes, and little is known of the trophic ecology of either native or nonnative fishes in this system. Gut contents and stable isotopes (13C and 15N) were used to identify trophic relationships, trophic niche overlap and evaluate potential interactions among native and nonnative fishes. Both native and nonnative fishes fed across multiple trophic levels. In general, adult native suckers had lower 15N signatures and consumed more algae and detritus than smaller native fish, including juvenile suckers. Adult nonnative smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), yellow bullhead (Ameiurus natalis) and two species of trout preyed on small-bodied fishes and predaceous aquatic invertebrates leading to significantly higher trophic positions than small and large-bodied native fishes. Thus, the presence of these nonnative fishes extended community food-chain lengths by foraging at higher trophic levels. Although predation on juvenile native fishes might threaten persistence of native fishes, the high degree of omnivory suggests that impacts of nonnative predators may be lessened and dependent on environmental variability.},

This can be problematic when comparing structure of assemblages in under-studied regions or habitats, such as watersheds in dry tropical forests. Here, we compared assemblage-wide trophic metrics and intraspecific variation for a subset of consumer traits across rivers and among different ecosystem types within the Grijalva and Usumacinta River basins of Mexico. The two rivers differ with respect to flow-regime alteration and climate: the Grijalva River has been hydrologically altered by a series of dams and has wet and dry tropical forests in its watershed, whereas the Usumacinta River remains unimpounded with a watershed dominated by tropical wet forest. Use of allochthonous resources was pervasive in Usumacinta basin tributaries, with stable isotope signatures suggesting that many fishes directly consumed riparian plants and detritus. In contrast, fish assemblages in Grijalva basin tributaries were supported by higher proportions of in-stream production. Food-chain length was highest in a Grijalva River reservoir fish assemblage, although trophic diversity was low in the impounded system compared to the mainstem Usumacinta River, where fishes consumed the broadest variety of food resources. We also observed differences in trophic ecology and body nutrient content within taxa across habitat types and basins. The differences we observed suggest that even in relatively intact watersheds, expectations for trophic structure in tropical streams should be adjusted based on factors such as discharge, climate, and riparian forest cover.},

Stable isotope and Se concentration data demonstrated that Se concentrations in aquatic primary producers and food chain lengths were comparable in lentic and lotic habitats. Enhanced formation of organoselenium and subsequent uptake and cycling via sediment–detrital pathways likely account for higher fish tissue Se concentrations in lentic than in lotic areas.},

	abstract = {Summary Dams fragment river systems worldwide, and Mediterranean-climate rivers, characterised by highly seasonal hydrographs and adapted biotas, are particularly impacted by flow regulation. Whereas the effects of flow regulation on hydrology, sediment transport and biodiversity have long been examined, responses at the food-web level remain understudied. Environmental variation is a key control of food-web structure. Thus, we predicted that flow regulation would impact food-chain length (FCL) via changes in the flow variation regime, and we tested this prediction in a set of flow unregulated to completely regulated reaches in a Mediterranean river basin. In each reach, we characterised flow variation, together with two other putative controls of FCL (productivity and habitat size). We combined community data with carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes to estimate food-chain length, and Bayesian mixing models allowed estimates of dietary proportions of consumers. Flow variation was paramount in controlling FCL in the studied river network, and this same control largely explained the degree of omnivory among top predators. Thus, omnivory mechanisms were the main proximate structural mechanism allowing shifts in food-web structure and linking disturbance regimes to FCL. Our results suggest that flow regulation in Mediterranean rivers may impact food-web structure even when no significant changes in community composition are observed. If highly variable Mediterranean streams become increasingly affected by flow regulation, the resulting more stable conditions could enhance intraguild predation and thus lengthen riverine food chains.},

	abstract = {Recent findings indicate that fishes from lakes in partially burned catchments contain greater mercury (Hg) concentrations than fishes from reference catchments. Increased methyl Hg (MeHg) concentrations in fishes can result in serious health problems for consumers. Here we show that a forest fire caused a 5-fold increase in whole-body Hg accumulation by rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and smaller Hg increases in muscle of several fish species in a mountain lake. The enhanced Hg accumulation was caused primarily by increased nutrient concentrations in the lake, which enhanced productivity and restructured the food web through increased piscivory and consumption of Mysis. This restructuring resulted in increases to the trophic positions and Hg concentrations of fishes. Forest fire also caused a large short-term release of total Hg (THg) and MeHg to streams and the lake. This release initiated a small pulse of MeHg in invertebrates that contributed to enhanced Hg accumulation by fishes. Climate change and prescribed burning to compensate for past fire suppression are predicted to increase future forest fire occurrence in North America, and increased Hg accumulation by fishes may be an unexpected consequence.δ15N,nitrogen stable isotope ratio;BAδ15N,baseline-adjusted δ15N;THg,total mercury;MeHg,methyl mercury;DOC,dissolved organic carbon.},

	abstract = {Fish assemblages in tropical river food webs are characterized by high taxonomic diversity, diverse foraging modes, omnivory, and an abundance of detritivores. Feeding links are complex and modified by hydrologic seasonality and system productivity. These properties make it difficult to generalize about feeding relationships and to identify dominant linkages of energy flow. We analyzed the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of 276 fishes and other food web components living in four Venezuelan rivers that differed in basal food resources to determine 1) whether fish trophic guilds integrated food resources in a predictable fashion, thereby providing similar trophic resolution as individual species, 2) whether food chain length differed with system productivity, and 3) how omnivory and detritivory influenced trophic structure within these food webs. Fishes were grouped into four trophic guilds (herbivores, detritivores/algivores, omnivores, piscivores) based on literature reports and external morphological characteristics. Results of discriminant function analyses showed that isotope data were effective at reclassifying individual fish into their pre-identified trophic category. Nutrient-poor, black-water rivers showed greater compartmentalization in isotope values than more productive rivers, leading to greater reclassification success. In three out of four food webs, omnivores were more often misclassified than other trophic groups, reflecting the diverse food sources they assimilated. When fish δ15N values were used to estimate species position in the trophic hierarchy, top piscivores in nutrient-poor rivers had higher trophic positions than those in more productive rivers. This was in contrast to our expectation that productive systems would promote longer food chains. Although isotope ratios could not resolve species-level feeding pathways, they did reveal how top consumers integrate isotopic variability occurring lower in the food web. Top piscivores, regardless of species, had carbon and nitrogen profiles less variable than other trophic groups.},

Several studies have investigated the mechanisms underlying FCL patterns, but none has specifically examined the effect of temperature variability. In river ecosystems, water temperature variability can modify community structure, individuals’ activity, and individuals’ physiological rates, among other things. As such, we expected that it would negatively influence FCL. To test this prediction, we took advantage of a dataset comprising five streams, which mainly differ according to their temperature variability. At each stream, we (i) studied the species composition of macroinvertebrates and fish, and using nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes, (ii) estimated realized FCL, and (iii) examined food web structure. For macroinvertebrates, but not for fish, species composition differed among sites displaying low and high temperature variability. FCL was negatively influenced by temperature variability. Confirming this trend, we found a highly significant linear relationship between FCL and temperature variability using data from the literature. As for food web structure, the trophic position of filter-feeders/shredders may explain the FCL differences among sites. Our study gives additional support to the “dynamic stability” hypothesis and advances a step further by suggesting that temperature variability alone may reduce FCL.},

	abstract = {Abstract Characterisation of food webs, by summarising energy transfer and trophic relationships, allows more functional measurement of ecosystems and may reveal threats (e.g., land-cover change) in sensitive environments that are not obvious from conventional biomonitoring. However, typical methods used to achieve this are time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, we tested the usefulness of fish-focused food-web proxies as functional measures, specifically mass–abundance relationships of fish assemblages and stable isotope (SI)-derived metrics in headwater stream reaches. These metrics have been trialled before for similar use in other settings, but have yielded varying results, and have not been employed in tandem in temperate freshwaters. Sampling reaches (N = 46) were spread across a variety of streams, and the effects of habitat predictors at multiple scales on metrics were assessed using model selection. We found that habitat size positively correlated with food-chain lengths in streams, possibly because of increased abundance of fish at multiple trophic levels in habitats with more space. Additionally, flood disturbance was negatively associated with fish mass–abundance and carbon range, likely due to the harshness of flood-prone streams. Riparian land-cover variables were correlated with multiple metrics, indicating the importance of terrestrial–aquatic linkages. Additionally, variations in all metrics were influenced by the presence of native, predatory longfin eels. Overall, we conclude that mass–abundance relationships and SI-derived metrics are sensitive to drivers of trophic organisation and likely reflect processes occurring at multiple spatial scales in freshwaters. Thus, these metrics could be an insightful monitoring tool for managers because they reflect functional measures of aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Summary Very little is known about the ecosystem impacts of river salinization despite expectations for global increases in salinization with growing water demand and climate change. In some rivers in the southwestern United States, salinization has occurred as a result of natural saline inputs exacerbated by flow alteration and other anthropogenic impacts. Salinization in the Pecos River has been linked to declines in fish diversity, but impacts on the structure of aquatic food webs have not been investigated. We assessed variation in local food webs along the longitudinal gradient of the main stem Pecos River by estimating carbon sources, trophic positions and assemblage-wide trophic structure for aquatic consumers at 12 sites using stable isotope analysis (δ13C and δ15N). Temporal variation across seasons was also examined for common fish species at a subset of sites. Consumer richness, food-chain length and assemblage-wide niche breadth were inversely related to specific conductivity. Mixing models revealed differences in sources of dietary carbon supporting fish production along the longitudinal fluvial gradient, with a shift towards reliance on algal production in the salinized reaches of the river. Trophic niche breadth was greatest for assemblages in less degraded sites with higher fish species richness. Local food webs in salinized sites were dominated by euryhaline species and had shorter food chains and narrower assemblage-wide niche breadths. Across seasons, δ13C and δ15N signatures remained fairly constant for five common fish species. Our results suggest that salinization in portions of the Pecos River constrains the diversity of consumers and trophic resources in local food webs. Characterising changes in food-web structure in relation to salinization and other environmental changes is important for habitat assessment, stream restoration and other conservation strategies.},

	abstract = {AbstractFood-chain length (FCL) is a key factor underlying patterns of energy flow and trophic structure in food webs. Natural gradients in resource availability, ecosystem size, and disturbance are thought to govern FCL in rivers. However, anthropogenic influences on FCL, including landscape modification (e.g., land-cover change) and river regulation (e.g., dams), remain unresolved. From 2010 to 2013 we characterized fish food webs at 12 river reaches along an ∼185-km section of the 6th-order Scioto River system (Ohio, USA) to assess the effects of natural and anthropogenic factors and the potential influence of shifts in foodweb structure (e.g., diversity, top-predator body size, intermediate predator richness) on fish FCL. Stable isotope-derived estimates of FCL ranged from 3.66 to 4.35, which are comparable to global values of FCL in rivers. A model-selection approach returned a set of linear regression models that explained 38 to 74\% of the variation in FCL. Local ecosystem size (i.e., channel width) was positively related to FCL and was the most common predictor in the model set. Total dissolved solids, riparian agricultural land cover, and drainage area were all positively associated with FCL, whereas developed land cover (i.e., urban) was negatively related to FCL. In addition, FCL was significantly lower in impounded vs free-flowing reaches. Impounded reaches had fewer top-predator taxa, reduced fish diversity, and notable shifts in assemblage composition. Overall, we interpret these results to suggest that although natural physical factors have strong influences on FCL in rivers, human alterations can be important determinants of FCL in regulated river systems. In particular, disruption of hydrogeomorphic gradients may integrate changes in energy flow and foodweb architecture, thereby shortening FCL and potentially destabilizing food webs.},

This result suggests shorter food chains that contain a diverse array of large-bodied herbivores and omnivores that act as prey for generalist predators, such as eels, in tropical systems. The resulting altered size spectrum limits the size and trophic position of top predators that can be supported in the face of constraints from known limits to FCL, including productivity, ecosystem size, and disturbance.

We conducted a field experiment and manipulated structural complexity and basal resource diversity to determine their effect on multiple aspects of community and food-web structure of degraded tropical streams. In-stream manipulations included the addition of woody debris (WD) and the addition of wood and leaf packs (WLP). The addition of structural complexity to degraded streams promoted detritus retention and had a positive effect on stream taxonomic richness, abundance and biomass. At the conclusion of the experiment, abundance and richness in the WD-treated reaches increased by over 110\% and 80\%, respectively, while abundance and richness in the WLP-treated reaches increased by over 280\% and 170\% respectively. Wood debris and leaves were consumed only by few taxa. Detritivorous taxa were the most abundant trophic guild at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. Food webs in treated reaches were relatively more complex in terms of links and species at the conclusion of the experiment, with highest maximum food chain length in the WD treatments and highest number of trophic species, links, link density, predators and prey at the WLP treatment. Despite differences observed in diet-based food webs, there was little variation in isotopic niche space, likely due to the high degree of omnivory and trophic redundancy, which was attributed to the importance of fine detritus that supported a broad range of consumers. Even in these degraded streams, aquatic taxa responded to the addition of increased complexity suggesting that these efforts may be an effective first step to restoring the structure and function of these food webs.},

Studies from Central Europe have shown a relationship between the impaired population status of threatened freshwater mussel species and elevated nitrate nitrogen (N−NO) concentrations in running waters. 2. Causal mechanisms, however, remain unknown, and no experimental data or comprehensive studies involving more species are available, which causes uncertainty in prioritizing conservation actions. 3. This study uses both descriptive and experimental approaches to identify the effects of nitrates on freshwater mussels and demonstrates the need for integrating different research methods for development of conservation strategies for threatened species. 4. Spatial co-occurrence of five native freshwater mussel species (Anodonta anatina, Pseudanodonta complanata, Unio pictorum, Unio tumidus, Unio crassus) and N−NO concentrations were examined in a 7th-order river catchment (Lužnice River, Czech Republic) with anthropogenically-induced increasing N−NO levels and declining populations of these species during the 20th century. 5. Acute toxicity of N−NO was then estimated for artificially reared juveniles of A. anatina and U. crassus using both lethal and sublethal test endpoints. 6. Results showed that the probability of occurrence of all species was significantly reduced in reaches with elevated N−NO levels. 7. In contrast, the results of toxicity testing revealed that the juvenile stages of the two tested species were less sensitive to N−NO than most previously tested freshwater macroinvertebrates. The detected 96-h median lethal N−NO concentrations were two orders of magnitude higher than the limits derived from distributional data. 8. Despite the probable absence of a direct negative effect of N−NO on freshwater mussel populations, N−NO has potential to be used as an effective indicator of biotope conditions. Identification of causal mechanisms responsible for the observed relationship between unionids and N−NO will require further research. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Here, we propose joint species movement modeling (JSMM) as an analogous approach that enables inferring both species- and community-level movement parameters from multispecies movement data. The species-level movement parameters are modeled as a function of species traits and phylogenetic relationships, allowing one to ask how species traits influence movements, and whether phylogenetically related species are similar in their movement behavior. We illustrate the modeling framework with two contrasting case studies: a stochastic redistribution model for direct observations of bird movements and a spatially structured diffusion model for capture–recapture data on moth movements. In both cases, the JSMM identified several traits that explain differences in movement behavior among species, such as movement rate increasing with body size in both birds and moths. We show with simulations that the JSMM approach increases precision of species-specific parameter estimates by borrowing information from other species that are closely related or have similar traits. The JSMM framework is applicable for many kinds of data, and it facilitates a mechanistic understanding of the causes and consequences of interspecific variation in movement behavior.},

	abstract = {Little is known about how mutualistic interactions affect the distribution of species richness on broad geographic scales. Because mutualism positively affects the fitness of all species involved in the interaction, one hypothesis is that the richness of species involved should be positively correlated across their range, especially for obligate relationships. Alternatively, if mutualisms involve multiple mutualistic partners, the distribution of mutualists should not necessarily be related, and patterns in species distributions might be more strongly correlated with environmental factors. In this study, we compared the distributions of plants and vertebrate animals involved in seed-dispersal mutualisms across the United States and Canada. We compiled geographic distributions of plants dispersed by frugivores and scatter-hoarding animals, and compared their distribution of richness to the distribution in disperser richness. We found that the distribution of animal dispersers shows a negative relationship to the distribution of the plants that they disperse, and this is true whether the plants dispersed by frugivores or scatter-hoarders are considered separately or combined. In fact, the mismatch in species richness between plants and the animals that disperse their seeds is dramatic, with plants species richness greatest in the in the eastern United States and the animal species richness greatest in the southwest United States. Environmental factors were corelated with the difference in the distribution of plants and their animal mutualists and likely are more important in the distribution of both plants and animals. This study is the first to describe the broad-scale distribution of seed-dispersing vertebrates and compare the distributions to the plants they disperse. With these data, we can now identify locations that warrant further study to understand the factors that influence the distribution of the plants and animals involved in these mutualisms.},

Terrestrial detritus is expected to have the greatest impact on food webs when water bodies are small and shallow with low levels of incident light. Temporary forested ponds fit this description and are often assumed to have a leaf detritus-based food web, but this has not been quantified. In a whole-ecosystem experiment, we traced the flow of isotopically enriched leaf litter to primary producers and consumers in a small, forested pond. We found that terrestrial leaves provided nutrients to algae, offering an indirect pathway in which leaf litter can enter the food web. Terrestrial leaves were also consumed directly, and larval caddisfly (Limnephilus sp.) shredders likely mobilized leaf nutrients to other consumers, a process overlooked in many previous small-scale experiments that did not incorporate shredders. Unexpectedly, most consumers relied heavily upon algal food pathways despite low light and net heterotrophic conditions. Overall, our study highlights the interconnectedness of algal and leaf litter pathways in small pond food webs, and emphasizes that algal pathways are prevalent and important even in small, shaded ponds with high loads of terrestrial leaf litter.},

To illustrate the approach, we explore two case studies: an experimental freshwater algal community and a long-term time series of displacement in an intertidal community. We demonstrate how our method helps recover observed coexistence patterns, capture the core dynamics of the system, and, in the latter case, predict the impacts of experimental extinctions.

To disentangle more complex patterns than those based on single species/ single populations, we quantified migration variability using two sympatric ungulate species differing in their foraging strategy, mating system and physiological constraints due to body size. We related observed variation to a set of hypotheses. We used GPS-collar data from 537 individuals in 10 roe Capreolus capreolus and 12 red deer Cervus elaphus populations spanning environmental gradients across Europe to assess variation in migration propensity, distance and timing. Using time-to-event models, we explored how the probability of migration varied in relation to sex, landscape (e.g. topography, forest cover) and temporally-varying environmental factors (e.g. plant green-up, snow cover). Migration propensity varied across study areas. Red deer were, on average, three times more migratory than roe deer (56\% versus 18\%). This relationship was mainly driven by red deer males which were twice as migratory as females (82\% versus 38\%). The probability of roe deer migration was similar between sexes. Roe deer (both sexes) migrated earliest in spring. While territorial male roe deer migrated last in autumn, male and female red deer migrated around the same time in autumn, likely due to their polygynous mating system. Plant productivity determined the onset of spring migration in both species, but if plant productivity on winter ranges was sufficiently high, roe deer were less likely to leave. In autumn, migration coincided with reduced plant productivity for both species. This relationship was stronger for red deer. Our results confirm that ungulate migration is influenced by plant phenology, but in a novel way, that these effects appear to be modulated by species-specific traits, especially mating strategies.},

These issues, together known as the modifiable areal unit problem, are well known in geography. These factors limit the degree to which results from different metacommunity and macro-ecological studies can be compared to draw new inferences, and yet these types of comparisons are widespread in community ecology. Using aquatic community datasets, we demonstrate that spatial context drives analytical results when landscapes are sub-divided. Next, we present a framework for using resampling and neighborhood smoothing to standardize datasets to allow for inferential comparisons. We then provide examples for how addressing these issues enhances our ability to understand the processes shaping ecological communities at landscape scales and allows for informative meta-analytical synthesis. We conclude by calling for greater recognition of issues derived from the modifiable areal unit problem in community ecology, discuss implications of the problem for interpreting the existing literature, and identify tools and approaches for future research.},

	abstract = {Water quality and contaminants have been frequently identified as critical stressors for freshwater mussels, many species of which are highly imperiled throughout North America and the world. Nutrient pollution, specifically nitrate, has become one of the most prevalent causes of water quality degradation globally, with increasing anthropogenic input from suburban and agricultural runoff, municipal wastewater, and industrial waste. Nitrate acute toxicity is generally low for aquatic species, but the potential effects of nitrate exposure are largely unknown for freshwater mussels, particularly during the parasitic stage of their complex lifecycle. Therefore, this study was designed to determine the effects of short-term nitrate exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations on juvenile production in two freshwater mussel species. Lampsilis siliquoidea and L. fasciola glochidia were exposed to nitrate (0, 11, or 56 mg NO3-N/L) for 24 h before inoculation on a primary host, Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides). Glochidia attachment, metamorphosis success, and total number of juveniles produced were monitored on individual fish. Exposure of L. siliquoidea glochidia to 56 mg NO3-N/L nitrate resulted in a significant (p = 0.02) 35\% reduction of total juveniles produced, a combined result of moderate decreases in both glochidia attachment and metamorphosis success. A similar trend (28\% reduction; p = 0.06) was evident with 11 mg NO3-N/L. No effects were apparent for L. fasciola, suggesting species-specific differences in responses even among closely related species. These results are the first to suggest that glochidia exposure to nitrate may adversely affect juvenile recruitment in some species. Findings from these studies are important for improving characterization of the hazards of nitrate pollution to aquatic life and this work will help better define the role of water quality in assessing habitat suitability for mussel conservation efforts.},

Twenty mussels were placed in chambers buried 2.5 cm into reference sediments to approximate pore-water exposure (sediment tests) or elevated above the bottom of the experimental units (water-only tests). In the sediment tests, a pH gradient existed between the overlying water (mean 8.0), sediment–water interface (mean 7.7), and 2.5 cm depth (mean 7.4). We assumed that mussels were exposed to ammonia in pore water and report effect concentrations in pore water, but if they were exposed to the higher pH water, more of the ammonia would be in the toxic un-ionized (NH3) form. The only differences in toxicity and growth between mussel species occurred in some of the water-only tests. In sediment tests, median lethal concentrations (LC50s) ranged from 124 to 125 μg NH3-N/L. In water-only tests, LC50s ranged from 157 to 372 μg NH3-N/L. In sediment tests, median effective concentrations (EC50s based on growth) ranged from 30 to 32 μg NH3-N/L. Juvenile mussels in the water-only tests grew poorly and did not exhibit a dose–response relation. These data demonstrate that growth is a sensitive and valuable endpoint for studies on ammonia toxicity with juvenile freshwater mussels and that growth should be measured via sediment tests.},

The changed behavior was especially valuable for protecting the most important and vulnerable members of the colony.Science, this issue p. 941Animal social networks are shaped by multiple selection pressures, including the need to ensure efficient communication and functioning while simultaneously limiting disease transmission. Social animals could potentially further reduce epidemic risk by altering their social networks in the presence of pathogens, yet there is currently no evidence for such pathogen-triggered responses. We tested this hypothesis experimentally in the ant Lasius niger using a combination of automated tracking, controlled pathogen exposure, transmission quantification, and temporally explicit simulations. Pathogen exposure induced behavioral changes in both exposed ants and their nestmates, which helped contain the disease by reinforcing key transmission-inhibitory properties of the colony’s contact network. This suggests that social network plasticity in response to pathogens is an effective strategy for mitigating the effects of disease in social groups.},

Variations among datasets in the slope, b, have been associated with multiple factors of central importance in ecology, including strength of competitive interactions and demographic rates. But these associations are not transparent, and the relative importance of these and other factors for TL slope variation is poorly studied. TL is thus a ubiquitously used indicator in ecology, the understanding of which is still opaque. The goal of this study was to provide tools to help fill this gap in understanding by providing proximate determinants of TL slopes, statistical quantities that are correlated to TL slopes but are simpler than the slope itself and are more readily linked to ecological factors. Using numeric simulations and 82 multi-decadal population datasets, we here propose, test and apply two proximate statistical determinants of TL slopes which we argue can become key tools for understanding the nature and ecological causes of TL slope variation. We find that measures based on population skewness, coefficient of variation and synchrony are effective proximate determinants. We demonstrate their potential for application by using them to help explain covariation in slopes of spatial and temporal TL (two common types of TL). This study provides tools for understanding TL, and demonstrates their usefulness.},

By conducting a field experiment in a temperate grassland, we found that both plant richness and temporal stability of community biomass increased with spatial scale, but N enrichment reduced richness and stability at the two scales considered. Reduced local-scale stability under N enrichment arose from N-induced reduction in population stability, which was partly attributable to the decline in local species richness, as well as reduction in asynchronous local population dynamics across species. Importantly, N enrichment did not alter spatial asynchrony among local communities, which provided similar spatial insurance effects at the larger scale, regardless of N enrichment levels. These results suggest that spatial variability among local communities, in addition to local diversity, may help stabilise ecosystems at larger spatial scales even in the face of anthropogenic environmental changes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Positive biodiversity–ecosystem-functioning (BEF) relationships are commonly found in experimental and observational studies, but how they vary in different environmental contexts and under the influence of coexisting life forms is still controversial. Investigating these variations is important for making predictions regarding the dynamics of plant communities and carbon pools under global change. We conducted this study across 433 shrubland sites in northern China. We fitted structural equation models (SEMs) to analyze the variation in the species-richness–biomass relationships of shrubs and herbs along a wetness gradient and general liner models (GLMs) to analyze how shrub or herb biomass affected the species-richness–biomass relationship of the other life form. We found that the positive species-richness–biomass relationships for both shrubs and herbs became weaker or even negative with higher water availability, likely indicating stronger interspecific competition within life forms under more benign conditions. After accounting for variation in environmental contexts using residual regression, we found that the benign effect of greater facilitation by a larger shrub biomass reduced the positive species-richness–biomass relationships of herbs, causing them to become nonsignificant. Different levels of herb biomass, however, did not change the species-richness–biomass relationship of shrubs, possibly because greater herb biomass did not alter the stress level for shrubs. We conclude that biodiversity in the studied plant communities is particularly important for plant biomass production under arid conditions and that it might be possible to use shrubs as nurse plants to facilitate understory herb establishment in ecological restoration.},

	abstract = {Abstract Emerging infectious diseases increasingly threaten wildlife populations. Most studies focus on managing short-term epidemic properties, such as controlling early outbreaks. Predicting long-term endemic characteristics with limited retrospective data is more challenging. We used individual-based modeling informed by individual variation in pathogen load and transmissibility to predict long-term impacts of a lethal, transmissible cancer on Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations. For this, we employed approximate Bayesian computation to identify model scenarios that best matched known epidemiological and demographic system properties derived from 10 yr of data after disease emergence, enabling us to forecast future system dynamics. We show that the dramatic devil population declines observed thus far are likely attributable to transient dynamics (initial dynamics after disease emergence). Only 21\% of matching scenarios led to devil extinction within 100 yr following devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) introduction, whereas DFTD faded out in 57\% of simulations. In the remaining 22\% of simulations, disease and host coexisted for at least 100 yr, usually with long-period oscillations. Our findings show that pathogen extirpation or host–pathogen coexistence are much more likely than the DFTD-induced devil extinction, with crucial management ramifications. Accounting for individual-level disease progression and the long-term outcome of devil–DFTD interactions at the population-level, our findings suggest that immediate management interventions are unlikely to be necessary to ensure the persistence of Tasmanian devil populations. This is because strong population declines of devils after disease emergence do not necessarily translate into long-term population declines at equilibria. Our modeling approach is widely applicable to other host–pathogen systems to predict disease impact beyond transient dynamics.},

	doi = {doi:10.1002/ecy.2583},
	abstract = {Abstract Determining the degree to which predation affects prey abundance in natural communities constitutes a key goal of ecological research. Predators can affect prey through both consumptive effects (CEs) and nonconsumptive effects (NCEs), although the contributions of each mechanism to the density of prey populations remain largely hypothetical in most systems. Common statistical methods applied to time-series data cannot elucidate the mechanisms responsible for hypothesized predator effects on prey density (e.g., differentiate CEs from NCEs), nor can they provide parameters for predictive models. State-space models (SSMs) applied to time-series data offer a way to meet these goals. Here, we employ SSMs to assess effects of an invasive predatory zooplankter, Bythotrephes longimanus, on an important prey species, Daphnia mendotae, in Lake Michigan. We fit mechanistic models in an SSM framework to seasonal time series (1994–2012) using a recently developed, maximum-likelihood–based optimization method, iterated filtering, which can overcome challenges in ecological data (e.g., nonlinearities, measurement error, and irregular sampling intervals). Our results indicate that B. longimanus strongly influences D. mendotae dynamics, with mean annual peak densities of B. longimanus observed in Lake Michigan estimated to cause a 61\% reduction in D. mendotae population growth rate and a 59\% reduction in peak biomass density. Further, the observed B. longimanus effect is most consistent with an NCE via reduced birth rates. The SSM approach also provided estimates for key biological parameters (e.g., demographic rates) and the contribution of dynamic stochasticity and measurement error. Our study therefore provides evidence derived directly from survey data that the invasive zooplankter B. longimanus is affecting zooplankton demographics and offer parameter estimates needed to inform predictive models that explore the effect of B. longimanus under different scenarios, such as climate change.},

	abstract = {Abstract Nutrient supply is a key bottom-up control of phytoplankton primary production in lake ecosystems. Top-down control via grazing pressure by zooplankton also constrains primary production and primary production may simultaneously affect zooplankton. Few studies have addressed these bidirectional interactions. We used convergent cross-mapping (CCM), a numerical test of causal associations, to quantify the presence and direction of the causal relationships among environmental variables (light availability, surface water temperature, NO3-N, and PO4-P), phytoplankton community composition, primary production, and the abundances of five functional zooplankton groups (large cladocerans, small cladocerans, rotifers, calanoids, and cyclopoids) in Lake Kasumigaura, a shallow, hypereutrophic lake in Japan. CCM suggested that primary production was causally influenced by NO3-N and phytoplankton community composition; there was no detectable evidence of a causal effect of zooplankton on primary production. Our results also suggest that rotifers and cyclopoids were forced by primary production, and cyclopoids were further influenced by rotifers. However, our CCM suggested that primary production was weakly influenced by rotifers (i.e., bidirectional interaction). These findings may suggest complex linkages between nutrients, primary production, and rotifers and cyclopoids, a pattern that has not been previously detected or has been neglected. We used linear regression analysis to examine the relationships between the zooplankton community and pond smelt (Hypomesus nipponensis), the most abundant planktivore and the most important commercial fish species in Lake Kasumigaura. The relative abundance of pond smelt was significantly and positively correlated with the abundances of rotifers and cyclopoids, which were causally influenced by primary production. This finding suggests that bottom-up linkages between nutrient, primary production, and zooplankton abundance might be a key mechanism supporting high planktivore abundance in eutrophic lakes. Because increases in primary production and cyanobacteria blooms are likely to occur simultaneously in hypereutrophic lakes, our study highlights the need for ecosystem management to resolve the conflict between good water quality and high fishery production.},

Despite the growing interest in the impacts of anthropogenic noise, how noise alters the permeability of different types of land cover to animal movement in fragmented landscapes is underappreciated. Here, we experimentally quantified the movement distances of a frog species in three types of land cover common to fragmented landscapes (lawns with or without canopy cover and artificial bare land) under two acoustic manipulations (traffic noise vs. a silent control). The results showed that the effects of noise on frog movements varied among land covers: with movement being impeded on bare land and unaffected on lawns with and without a closed canopy. These results suggest that anthropogenic noise and land cover types can interactively affect the functional connectivity of these anurans and increase our understanding of the complex ecological consequences of urbanization. Our finding emphasizes that the impacts of noise on animal movement in fragmented landscapes should be evaluated with consideration of land cover types.},

	doi = {doi:10.1111/1365-2435.13130},
	abstract = {Abstract Anthropogenic noise is widespread, and growing evidence suggests that it can negatively affect animals through many different mechanisms including masking of cues and signals, distraction, and aversion to noise. Acoustic masking has received the most attention from researchers and recent evidence suggests that masking effects can be mitigated by alteration of signal frequencies or amplitudes by signalers. Additionally, alteration can be a learned response via prior experience with noise exposure. However, it remains unclear whether distraction or aversive effects due to noise can be mitigated by prior experience with noise, especially among signal receivers. Here, we addressed this gap by separating mechanisms of noise disturbances on female phonotaxis towards male advertisement calls in anurans. To do this, we experimentally examined phonotaxis of gravid females that differ in their prior experience with noise under three acoustic manipulations: spectrally overlapping and non-overlapping noise that either mask or do not mask male advertisement calls respectively, plus a silent control. We confirm two experience-dependent responses of noisy-site individuals relative to quiet-site individuals: faster initiation of phonotaxis under non-overlapping noise and a stronger aversive response against overlapping noise. However, we showed that, for both noisy- versus quiet-site individuals, both overlapping and non-overlapping noise treatments resulted in delayed initiation and disorientation of phonotaxis relative to silent control treatments. Our study provides the first evidence to demonstrate that, although prior experience appears to mitigate the negative effects of distraction or aversion to noise, prior experience falls short of fully compensating for disrupted orientation through phonotaxis. Additionally, although most studies have emphasized masking of biologically relevant cues and signals as the most prominent mechanism by which noise negatively affects wild organisms, we show that non-overlapping noise, which cannot cause signal and cue masking, can have negative consequences via distraction or aversive responses. This finding suggests that noise impacts could extend well beyond contexts involving acoustic cue detection and discrimination and deserves increased attention by researchers.

Bivalves impact nutrient cycling, create and modify habitat, and affect food webs directly (i.e., prey) and indirectly (i.e., movement of nutrients and energy).

Freshwater mussel and oyster aggregations in rivers and estuaries are hot spots for biodiversity and biogeochemical transformations. Historically, human use includes food, tools, currency, and ornamentation. Bivalves provide direct benefits to modern cultures as food, building materials, and jewelry and provide indirect benefits by stabilizing shorelines and mitigating nutrient pollution.

Mussel propagation could be used to restore populations of common mussel species and their ecosystem services.

	abstract = {Abstract Extreme disturbances, those high magnitude events that are statistically rare in a particular system, may affect consumer resource use through multiple mechanisms, such as differential consumer mortality and modified resource availability and quality. Documenting the ecological importance of these rare events is difficult, but essential, as the frequency of extreme events is predicted to increase under many climate change scenarios. We quantified changes in stream insect resource use following intense, nonseasonal flooding in the Rocky Mountains of northern Colorado during September 2013. We hypothesised that taxonomic identity, functional feeding group membership and disturbance-caused alterations in resource quantity and quality (C:N ratios) would determine consumer reliance on autochthonous and allochthonous resources and community structure following the disturbance. In summer 2014, we collected basal resources and stream insects for carbon, nitrogen and deuterium bulk stable isotope analysis, and community composition. Basal resource quantity and quality (C:N ratios) were collected at seven headwater streams along a 2013 flood intensity gradient. Using stable isotope mixing models, we analysed consumer autochthony. We also used baseline community composition data from 2011 to compare functional feeding group abundance prior to and following the flood events. We found that consumer resource use was primarily associated with detrital resource quantity, which was positively correlated with disturbance intensity and elevation. Functional feeding group membership did not predict resource use. However, consumers in functional feeding groups did experience differential mortality following flooding. Herbivore relative abundance significantly declined along the disturbance gradient, and predator relative abundance generally declined across all streams from 2011 to 2014. Our results suggest that changes in resource quantity from extreme disturbances can be associated with shifts in consumer resource use. Following this flood event, detritus standing stocks increased, resulting in a concomitant increase in consumer reliance on allochthonous sources.},

We used linear mixed models and hierarchical partitioning to model and test the independent effects of each variable in explaining U. delphinus feces production, which was used as a proxy for nutrient enrichment. Unio delphinus responded to high temperatures with higher clearance and respiration rates, showing an increase in energy expenditure. Feces production varied significantly with each factor and there was an interactive effect between the factors; increasing with temperature and trophic condition, and declining in the presence of the invasive clam. The hierarchical partitioning model showed that the system trophic condition and C. fluminea were the most important factors explaining feces production and to a lesser extent water temperature. Depletion of energetic reserves to cope with increasing temperatures could compromise the tolerance to additional stressors such as competition with invasive species or food reduction.},

We sampled Echyridella menziesii (Hyriidae) in six lakes from two regions of the North Island of New Zealand to develop general allometric relationships for predicting filtration, excretion and biodeposition rates. Experimental containers were set up in the field (no-flow conditions) to measure filtration and biodeposition using natural phytoplankton communities, and excretion in filtered lake water. Filtration rates were 0.02–1.3 L mussel−1 h−1 and increased with increasing mussel size (R2 = 0.13, P = 0.023). Stable isotope analysis suggests that mussels also assimilate food from non-planktonic origins. Nitrogen excretion rates were 4–50 μg N mussel−1 h−1 and increased with mussel size (R2 = 0.70, P {\textless} 0.0001), with no difference between regions (ANCOVA, P {\textgreater} 0.3).

The reason for this regional difference is unclear, but suggests that mussels could contribute different N:P ratios to nearshore nutrient budgets in different types of lakes. Biodeposits represented 50–70\% of the N, and 25–70\% of the P recycled. Echyridella filters and excretes nutrients at rates similar to those measured in North American and European mussels (Unionidae, Margaritiferidae). Mussels could be important contributors of nutrients in areas where they are abundant, and their inclusion into nutrient budget models could improve the predictions of nearshore nutrient fluxes in lakes and reservoirs.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recent studies indicate that the density and diversity of freshwater mussels are declining in many large river systems, possibly from low-level chemical contamination. Exposure of Lam-psilis ventricosa (Barnes, 1823) to 0, 22, 111, and 305 μg/L of cadmium for 28 d in a proportional diluter resulted in a significant decrease (p ≤ 0.05) in respiration rate as cadmium concentration increased. Although variations in cadmium concentrations did not significantly affect food clearance rates or ammonia excretion rates, mussels exposed to 305 μg cadmium per liter showed a decrease in ammonia excretion rates and a decrease in food clearance rates over the 28-d study. Assimilation efficiencies increased during the test in all treatments. Oxygen-to-nitrogen ratios were significantly increased in mussels exposed to either 111 or 305 μg cadmium per liter by day 28. Tissue condition index (TCI) values were significantly lower in mussels in the toxicity test than those in a field sample. The significant change in respiration rate after only a 28-d exposure to cadmium suggests that freshwater mussels may be sensitive indicators of sublethal contaminant exposure. However, the large variability in other physiological responses indicates that the study of contaminant effects requires careful selection of appropriate physiological indicators.},

In particular, fine sediments have been suggested to play a crucial role in the declines of freshwater mussels which are considered keystone fauna of streams and rivers. Whereas the effects of deposited fine sediments on recruitment failure are well known, effects of suspended fine sediments on adult mussel behavior are less studied. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of fine sediment exposure on freshwater mussel behavior and on mussel-dependent ecosystem services. Unio pictorum mussels were used to test three behavioral endpoints: Hall activity, transition frequency and relative water clearance rate. Mussels were exposed to fine sediments of different particle size classes ({\textless}45μm, 45–63μm, 63–125μm) and different concentration (0–10gL−1) of the smallest particle size class. Hall sensor technology and turbidity measurements were used to detect mussel behavior in presence of suspended sediments. Results revealed that mussels improve clearance of suspended particles out of the water column by 35\%, independent of particle size class and concentration. Transition frequency was determined an unsuitable behavioral endpoint for non-soluble substances. Contrary to previous studies, we could demonstrate that fine sediments do not interfere with filtration by mussels and that mussels have a great influence on water purification, providing a valuable ecosystem service.},

When fed with single foods, U. douglasiae has similar clearance rates on the three algae populations, while C. fluminea has significantly lower clearance rate on toxic M. aeruginosa than those on the other two algae populations. When fed with mixture foods, both the mussels show significantly higher clearance rates than on single foods. The clearance rates of U. douglasiae on the different food mixtures are not significantly different, and C. fluminea has a significantly lower clearance rate on the toxic food mixtures than that on non-toxic food mixtures. Although the relative lower clearance rates of C. fluminea on toxic food, we may still deduce that both the mussels can exert grazing pressure on phytoplankton. The deduction is supported by the composition of the excretion products. The excretion products (faeces and pseudofaeces) of both mussels contained mainly S. obliquus. In both mixed-food treatments, the ratios of S. obliquus to M. aeruginosa in the excrete products are significantly higher than those in the foods. Therefore, it can be concluded that both mussels prefer M. aeruginosa to S. obliquus, and can cause grazing pressure on M. aeruginosa.},

	abstract = {Abstract Temperature has a key impact on the physiology, food acquisition, metabolic rate, growth, and reproduction of organisms. Thus, exploring the effects of climate change on species physiology is important for the conservation and management of native and non-native bivalve species. In this work, an integrative laboratory approach was used to compare the physiological, cellular, and molecular responses of the native Unio delphinus and the invasive non-native Corbicula fluminea under a natural heat-wave event. Whereas the filtration rate in C. fluminea was clearly affected throughout the whole heat-wave event (from the heat peak onwards), it was only significantly affected during the heat-wave climax in U. delphinus, and recovered afterwards. At the cellular level, lysosomal membrane stability was affected during the heat-wave climax, but recovered afterwards, in both native and non-native bivalve species. At the molecular level, hsp70 and hsp90 gene expression were increased and decreased (respectively) in C. fluminea after the heat wave. In contrast, only hsp90 gene expression decreased in U. delphinus during the climax and after the heat wave. The present work demonstrates that accurate monitoring of native and non-native species using an integrated biomarker approach provides new insights into how both species might cope with the expected increase in frequency and intensity of heat events in a global warming context. Direct and indirect impacts of heat waves have been associated with massive mortalities of both native and non-native species. Despite present results showing that C. fluminea are more sensitive to heat waves than U. delphinus, massive mortality events might act in favour of C. fluminea as it has a higher reproductive capacity. Although native freshwater mussel species conservation is already threatened by overexploitation, flow regulation and diversions, habitat destruction, and pollution, it is probably also adversely affected by global warming and the presence of invasive non-native species, such as C. fluminea.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT In many parts of the world forest disturbance regimes have intensified recently, and future climatic changes are expected to amplify this development further in the coming decades. These changes are increasingly challenging the main objectives of forest ecosystem management, which are to provide ecosystem services sustainably to society and maintain the biological diversity of forests. Yet a comprehensive understanding of how disturbances affect these primary goals of ecosystem management is still lacking. We conducted a global literature review on the impact of three of the most important disturbance agents (fire, wind, and bark beetles) on 13 different ecosystem services and three indicators of biodiversity in forests of the boreal, cool- and warm-temperate biomes. Our objectives were to (i) synthesize the effect of natural disturbances on a wide range of possible objectives of forest management, and (ii) investigate standardized effect sizes of disturbance for selected indicators via a quantitative meta-analysis. We screened a total of 1958 disturbance studies published between 1981 and 2013, and reviewed 478 in detail. We first investigated the overall effect of disturbances on individual ecosystem services and indicators of biodiversity by means of independence tests, and subsequently examined the effect size of disturbances on indicators of carbon storage and biodiversity by means of regression analysis. Additionally, we investigated the effect of commonly used approaches of disturbance management, i.e. salvage logging and prescribed burning. We found that disturbance impacts on ecosystem services are generally negative, an effect that was supported for all categories of ecosystem services, i.e. supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services (P {\textless} 0.001). Indicators of biodiversity, i.e. species richness, habitat quality and diversity indices, on the other hand were found to be influenced positively by disturbance (P {\textless} 0.001). Our analyses thus reveal a ‘disturbance paradox’, documenting that disturbances can put ecosystem services at risk while simultaneously facilitating biodiversity. A detailed investigation of disturbance effect sizes on carbon storage and biodiversity further underlined these divergent effects of disturbance. While a disturbance event on average causes a decrease in total ecosystem carbon by 38.5\% (standardized coefficient for stand-replacing disturbance), it on average increases overall species richness by 35.6\%. Disturbance-management approaches such as salvage logging and prescribed burning were neither found significantly to mitigate negative effects on ecosystem services nor to enhance positive effects on biodiversity, and thus were not found to alleviate the disturbance paradox. Considering that climate change is expected to intensify natural disturbance regimes, our results indicate that biodiversity will generally benefit from such changes while a sustainable provisioning of ecosystem services might come increasingly under pressure. This underlines that disturbance risk and resilience require increased attention in ecosystem management in the future, and that new approaches to addressing the disturbance paradox in management are needed.},

	abstract = {The potential for regime shifts and critical transitions in ecological and Earth systems, particularly in a changing climate, has received considerable attention. However, the possibility of interactions between such shifts is poorly understood. Rocha et al. used network analysis to explore whether critical transitions in ecosystems can be coupled with each other, even when far apart (see the Perspective by Scheffer and van Nes). They report different types of potential cascading effects, including domino effects and hidden feedbacks, that can be prevalent in different systems. Such cascading effects can couple the dynamics of regime shifts in distant places, which suggests that the interactions between transitions should be borne in mind in future forecasts.Science, this issue p. 1379; see also p. 1357Regime shifts are large, abrupt, and persistent critical transitions in the function and structure of ecosystems. Yet, it is unknown how these transitions will interact, whether the occurrence of one will increase the likelihood of another or simply correlate at distant places. We explored two types of cascading effects: Domino effects create one-way dependencies, whereas hidden feedbacks produce two-way interactions. We compare them with the control case of driver sharing, which can induce correlations. Using 30 regime shifts described as networks, we show that 45\% of regime shift pairwise combinations present at least one plausible structural interdependence. The likelihood of cascading effects depends on cross-scale interactions but differs for each type. Management of regime shifts should account for potential connections.},

We extended such an investigation to include spatial structure in the disturbance regime. A spatially explicit metapopulation model was developed with a wide range of dispersal distances. The degree of aggregation of both habitat and disturbance pattern could be varied from a random distribution, through the intermediate case of a fractal distribution, all the way to complete aggregation (single block). Increasing spatial aggregation of disturbance generally increased extinction risk. The relative risk faced by populations in different landscapes varied greatly, depending on the disturbance regime. With random disturbance, the spatial aggregation of habitat reduced extinction risk, as in earlier studies. Where disturbance was spatially autocorrelated, however, this advantage was eliminated or reversed because populations in aggregated habitats are at risk of mass extinction from coarse-scale disturbance events. The effects of spatial patterns on extinction risk tended to be reduced by long-distance dispersal. Given the high levels of spatial correlation in natural and anthropogenic disturbance processes, population vulnerability may be greatly underestimated both by classical (nonspatial) models and by those that consider spatial structure in habitat alone.},

	title = {Path-dependent institutions drive alternative stable states in conservation},
	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1806852116},
	abstract = {Intrinsic institutional or ecological differences are often invoked to explain resource conservation success or failure. However, alternative conservation outcomes instead may be caused by path-dependent processes, where historical contingencies trap similar institutions in dramatically different, but predictable, states. We model social-ecological processes in cooperatively managed natural resources and show that institutional path dependence can create alternative stable states of conservation or overharvesting. We find that the model significantly explains a large dataset of well-studied marine fisheries. Highly productive and costly resources are, unexpectedly, most likely to exhibit the alternative stable states of strong depletion or conservation. Path dependence presents challenges and opportunities, including the possibility that short but intensive harvest reduction efforts can generate self-perpetuating conservation outcomes.Understanding why some renewable resources are overharvested while others are conserved remains an important challenge. Most explanations focus on institutional or ecological differences among resources. Here, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that conservation and overharvest can be alternative stable states within the same exclusive-resource management system because of path-dependent processes, including slow institutional adaptation. Surprisingly, this theory predicts that the alternative states of strong conservation or overharvest are most likely for resources that were previously thought to be easily conserved under optimal management or even open access. Quantitative analyses of harvest rates from 217 intensely managed fisheries supports the predictions. Fisheries’ harvest rates also showed transient dynamics characteristic of path dependence, as well as convergence to the alternative stable state after unexpected transitions. This statistical evidence for path dependence differs from previous empirical support that was based largely on case studies, experiments, and distributional analyses. Alternative stable states in conservation appear likely outcomes for many cooperatively managed renewable resources, which implies that achieving conservation outcomes hinges on harnessing existing policy tools to navigate transitions.},

	abstract = {Warmer and drier climate over the past few decades has brought larger fire sizes and increased annual area burned in forested ecosystems of western North America, and continued increases in annual area burned are expected due to climate change. As warming continues, fires may also increase in severity and produce larger contiguous patches of severely burned areas. We used remotely sensed burn-severity data from 125 fires in the northern Cascade Range of Washington, USA, to explore relationships between fire size, severity, and the spatial pattern of severity. We examined relationships between climate and the annual area burned and the size of wildfires over a 25-year period. We tested the hypothesis that increased fire size is commensurate with increased burn severity and increased spatial aggregation of severely burned areas. We also asked how local ecological controls might modulate these relationships by comparing results over the whole study area (the northern Cascade Range) to those from four ecological subsections within it. We found significant positive relationships between climate and fire size, and between fire size and the proportion of high severity and spatial-pattern metrics that quantify the spatial aggregation of high-severity areas within fires, but the strength and significance of these relationships varied among the four subsections. In areas with more contiguous subalpine forests and less complex topography, the proportion and spatial aggregation of severely burned areas were more strongly correlated with fire size. If fire sizes increase in a warming climate, changes in the extent, severity, and spatial pattern of fire regimes are likely to be more pronounced in higher-severity fire regimes with less complex topography and more continuous fuels.},

	abstract = {Abstract Cumulative ecological impacts of chronic, extreme, and often novel, anthropogenic environmental changes (i.e., stressors) often differ from the sum of their individual effects. Uncertainty over the causes of such non-additivity among multiple stressors confounds forecasts of their net ecological impact. Although stressors can interact directly within the environment to mediate their combined effects on communities, species interactions likely also play key roles. Here, we use a simulation model to explore how species interactions cause community responses (changes in species richness and total biomass) to paired stressors to differ from what we would expect based on the individual effects of each stressor (the additive effect). We demonstrate how interspecific interactions cause communities to respond non-additively to stressors, and how this depends on whether these interactions are negative or positive and whether the stressors have positive or negative impacts on the community property of interest. When pairwise species interactions involve at least one negative interaction (i.e., competition or predation), stressors combine to have greater than expected negative impacts (e.g., species or biomass loss) and less than expected positive impacts (e.g., biomass increases). In contrast, reciprocally positive interactions between species (i.e., facilitation) generally cause stressors to have additive, or slightly less than additive, net effects on species richness and community biomass. While species interactions determine the nature of the combined impact of multiple stressors (i.e., greater than or less than expected), species co-tolerance and stressor timing (i.e., sequential vs simultaneous application) only modify the magnitude of this effect. These findings highlight how interactions among species can contribute to non-additive responses by communities to environmental change, in addition to those caused by interactions among stressors themselves.},

For example, the productivity hypothesis suggests that resource availability limits FCL, whereas the productive-space hypothesis predicts that per-unit-size resource availability and ecosystem size equally limit FCL. However, previous studies have only measured total productivity to test FCL and have never tested the impact of resource availability within a system on FCL. Therefore, we estimated FCL in 15 ponds using stable isotope techniques to test the most common hypotheses for predicting FCL. We also measured total productivity, pond volume (ecosystem size), and edible microalgal carbon (resource availability) in each pond. We found that productive-space (edible carbon+pond volume) was the best model to predict FCL, and FCL was significantly correlated with edible carbon and pond volume. However, factors such as total productivity did not directly predict FCL of the ponds. Therefore, our results suggest that both resource availability and ecosystem size predict FCL in pond ecosystems and play significant roles in maintaining longer FCLs. Furthermore, the productive-space hypothesis appears to be particularly important for determining the FCL of ponds.},

	volume = {28},
	doi = {doi:10.1002/eap.1645},
	abstract = {Abstract Ecosystems sometimes undergo dramatic shifts between contrasting regimes. Shallow lakes, for instance, can transition between two alternative stable states: a clear state dominated by submerged aquatic vegetation and a turbid state dominated by phytoplankton. Theoretical models suggest that critical nutrient thresholds differentiate three lake types: highly resilient clear lakes, lakes that may switch between clear and turbid states following perturbations, and highly resilient turbid lakes. For effective and efficient management of shallow lakes and other systems, managers need tools to identify critical thresholds and state-dependent relationships between driving variables and key system features. Using shallow lakes as a model system for which alternative stable states have been demonstrated, we developed an integrated framework using Bayesian latent variable regression (BLR) to classify lake states, identify critical total phosphorus (TP) thresholds, and estimate steady state relationships between TP and chlorophyll a (chl a) using cross-sectional data. We evaluated the method using data simulated from a stochastic differential equation model and compared its performance to k-means clustering with regression (KMR). We also applied the framework to data comprising 130 shallow lakes. For simulated data sets, BLR had high state classification rates (median/mean accuracy {\textgreater}97\%) and accurately estimated TP thresholds and state-dependent TP-chl a relationships. Classification and estimation improved with increasing sample size and decreasing noise levels. Compared to KMR, BLR had higher classification rates and better approximated the TP-chl a steady state relationships and TP thresholds. We fit the BLR model to three different years of empirical shallow lake data, and managers can use the estimated bifurcation diagrams to prioritize lakes for management according to their proximity to thresholds and chance of successful rehabilitation. Our model improves upon previous methods for shallow lakes because it allows classification and regression to occur simultaneously and inform one another, directly estimates TP thresholds and the uncertainty associated with thresholds and state classifications, and enables meaningful constraints to be built into models. The BLR framework is broadly applicable to other ecosystems known to exhibit alternative stable states in which regression can be used to establish relationships between driving variables and state variables.},

	abstract = {Summary 1 Emerging wildlife diseases pose a significant threat to natural and human systems. Because of real or perceived risks of delayed actions, disease management strategies such as culling are often implemented before thorough scientific knowledge of disease dynamics is available. Adaptive management is a valuable approach in addressing the uncertainty and complexity associated with wildlife disease problems and can be facilitated by using a formal model. 2 We developed a multi-state computer simulation model using age, sex, infection-stage, and seasonality as a tool for scientific learning and managing chronic wasting disease (CWD) in white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus. Our matrix model used disease transmission parameters based on data collected through disease management activities. We used this model to evaluate management issues on density- (DD) and frequency-dependent (FD) transmission, time since disease introduction, and deer culling on the demographics, epizootiology, and management of CWD. 3 Both DD and FD models fit the Wisconsin data for a harvested white-tailed deer population, but FD was slightly better. Time since disease introduction was estimated as 36 (95\% CI, 24–50) and 188 (41–{\textgreater}200) years for DD and FD transmission, respectively. Deer harvest using intermediate to high non-selective rates can be used to reduce uncertainty between DD and FD transmission and improve our prediction of long-term epidemic patterns and host population impacts. A higher harvest rate allows earlier detection of these differences, but substantially reduces deer abundance. 4 Results showed that CWD has spread slowly within Wisconsin deer populations, and therefore, epidemics and disease management are expected to last for decades. Non-hunted deer populations can develop and sustain a high level of infection, generating a substantial risk of disease spread. In contrast, CWD prevalence remains lower in hunted deer populations, but at a higher prevalence the disease competes with recreational hunting to reduce deer abundance. 5 Synthesis and applications. Uncertainty about density- or frequency-dependent transmission hinders predictions about the long-term impacts of chronic wasting disease on cervid populations and the development of appropriate management strategies. An adaptive management strategy using computer modelling coupled with experimental management and monitoring can be used to test model predictions, identify the likely mode of disease transmission, and evaluate the risks of alternative management responses.},

We show that although larger group size increases GIN infection risk, a key cost of GIN infection—the suppression of food intake—is simultaneously moderated by living in larger groups.

	abstract = {The rapid development of mechanistic, trait-based models has resulted in increasingly reliable predictions of the functional diversity of individuals in populations and communities. However, a focus on individuals’ traits differs from the prevailing focus on species in much of community ecology. We sought to identify correlative links between species richness and size diversity, focusing on size diversity as one component of functional diversity. These links could be used to extend individual, size-based models to predict patterns of species richness. We used the distribution of the sizes of individuals in a community – the individual–size distribution (ISD) – as a measure of size diversity, and constructed Bayesian regression models with species richness as the response variable and ISDs as the predictor variables. We used two methods to include ISDs in our analyses. First, we summarized the ISD with five common diversity indices and used these indices as predictor variables in our analyses. Second, we used functional data analysis to include the entire ISD (a continuous function) as a predictor variable in our analyses. Analyses of diversity indices identified consistent, positive associations between species richness and size diversity. Analyses of entire ISDs revealed that these associations were driven by numbers of small- and medium-sized individuals. In general, a combination of diversity indices predicted species richness as well as or better than continuous ISDs. However, models with ISDs as predictor variables were less sensitive to technical details of model fitting (e.g. discretization method) than those based on diversity indices, and the use of ISDs avoids the arbitrary selection of one or several diversity indices. Our use of functional data analysis allows any trait distribution to be included as a variable in statistical analyses, and has the potential to reveal new diversity patterns in ecology.},

	volume = {0},
	doi = {doi:10.1002/ecy.2544},
	abstract = {Abstract The spatial distribution of species is not random; instead, individuals tend to gather, resulting in a non-random pattern. Previous studies used the independent negative binomial distribution (NBD) to model the distributional aggregation of a single species, in which the independence of the distribution of individuals of a species in different quadrats had been assumed. This way of analyzing aggregation will result in the scale-dependent estimation of the aggregation or shape parameter. However, because non-random (and therefore non-independent) distribution of individuals of a species in a finite area can be caused by either correlated or clumped distribution of individuals of a species between neighboring sites, an alternative model would assume that the distribution of individuals of a species over different sampling areas is multinomial. Here, we showed that, by assuming that regional species abundance followed a NBD while using a multinomial distribution to assign individuals of species in different non-overlapped sampling quadrats that are from a partition of the entire region (quantifying positive correlation or synchrony), the estimation of the shape parameter in this probabilistic model, which is the negative multinomial distribution (NMD), was scale-invariant (i.e., the estimated shape parameter is identical across different partitions of the study region). Accordingly, the estimation of the shape parameter was related to regional species distribution alone. This implied that, the shape parameter at the community level, using the NMD model, reflected the evenness of interspecific abundance. As a comparison, if the distribution of individuals of a single species followed independent NBDs as studied previously, the shape parameter would measure the evenness of intraspecific abundance (quantifying single-species’ distributional aggregation). Moreover, our study highlighted the necessity for adjusting the model for the effects of unsampled species when studying community-level distributional patterns. Collectively, as long as a target area is partitioned into non-overlapping quadrats (no matter how their sizes vary), the proposed NMD model in this study, along with the independent NBDs model, can be jointly formulated as a framework to reconcile the scale-dependent debate on the shape parameter, unifying the relationship between inter- or intraspecific abundance and distributional patterns.},

	abstract = {Abstract Consistent between-individual differences in movement are widely recognised across taxa. In addition, foraging plasticity at the within-individual level suggests a behavioural dependency on the internal energy demand. Because behaviour co-varies with fast-slow life history (LH) strategies in an adaptive context, as theoretically predicted by the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis, mass/energy fluxes should link behaviour and its plasticity with physiology at both between- and within-individual levels. However, a mechanistic framework driving these links in a fluctuating ecological context is lacking. Focusing on home range behaviour, we propose a novel behavioural-bioenergetics theoretical model to address such complexities at the individual level based on energy balance. We propose explicit mechanistic links between behaviour, physiology/metabolism and LH by merging two well-founded theories, the movement ecology paradigm and the dynamic energetic budget theory. Overall, our behavioural-bioenergetics model integrates the mechanisms explaining how (1) behavioural between- and within-individual variabilities connect with internal state variable dynamics, (2) physiology and behaviour are explicitly interconnected by mass/energy fluxes, and (3) different LHs may arise from both behavioural and physiological variabilities in a given ecological context. Our novel theoretical model reveals encouraging opportunities for empiricists and theoreticians to delve into the eco-evolutionary processes that favour or hinder the development of between-individual differences in behaviour and the evolution of personality-dependent movement syndromes.},

The strength of mean effect sizes was not significantly different between productivity and ecosystem size. These results lend general support to previous theories predicting the effect of productivity and ecosystem size, but fail to support the prediction that disturbance shortens food chains. In addition, our meta-analysis found that the effect sizes of primary studies were significantly heterogeneous for ecosystem size and disturbance, but not for productivity.

All lakes contained lake trout as the top predator, although lakes differed in the presumed number of trophic levels leading to this species. The presumed number of trophic levels was correlated with food chain length and explained 40\% of the among-lake variation. Food chain length was most closely related to fish species richness ([Formula: see text]) and lake area ([Formula: see text]). However, the two largest study lakes had shorter food chains than lakes of intermediate size and species richness, producing hump-shaped relationships with food chain length. Lake productivity was not a powerful predictor of food chain length ([Formula: see text]), and we argue that productive space (productivity multiplied by area) is a more accurate measure of available energy.

	doi = {doi:10.1890/15-1584.1},
	abstract = {Abstract The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) has been one of the most documented patterns in ecology, typically showing decreasing species diversity with increasing latitude. Studies of these patterns also used different spatial scales and dispersal traits to better understand the underpinning ecological factors. Seasonal freshwater ecosystems are less studied and may exhibit different patterns because they are more sensitive to climatic variation, which result in an inundation–desiccation cycle. In California, precipitation increases and temperature decreases with increasing latitude and thus the LDG pattern may be associated with this climatic gradient. Using collected data and United States Fish and Wildlife Service reports across seven degrees of latitude, analysis of California vernal pool invertebrate community (total richness and richness of passive and active dispersers) was conducted using correlations (Spearman rank and partial). Alpha diversity (total and passive dispersers) increased and beta diversity (passive dispersers) decreased with increasing latitude. Vernal pool surface area was correlated with active disperser alpha and passive disperser beta diversity. This suggests that climate-driven habitat size influences alpha and beta diversity patterns depending on dispersal ability. Active dispersers and predators exhibited higher beta diversity than passive dispersers and prey, respectively. Species composition differed among counties and some of these differences were correlated with pool depth and temperature. These results suggest that seasonal habitats will have diversity patterns strongly associated with local scale characteristics (habitat size and hydroperiod) determined by climate variation along the latitudinal gradient. Understanding these diversity patterns along the gradient will also contribute to management and restoration of these ecosystems with high endemism and diversity.},

Generally, spatial correlation in disturbance favoured long-range dispersers, while distance-limited dispersers were greatly suppressed. Interestingly, high levels of spatial aggregation of disturbance promoted long-term species coexistence that is not possible in the absence of disturbance, but only when the local disperser was intrinsically competitively superior. However, spatial correlation in disturbance led to different competitive outcomes, depending on the disturbed area. Concerning ecological conservation and management, we theoretically demonstrate that introducing a spatially correlated disturbance to the system or altering an existing disturbance regime can be a useful strategy either to control species invasion or to promote species coexistence. Disturbance pattern analysis may therefore provide new insights into biodiversity conservation.},

However, branching is associated with many other changes in stream condition, which make disentangling the effects of branching from associated environmental changes challenging. Moreover, much difficulty arises in scaling up local effects of branching within a watershed to the watershed as a whole, which is where diversity is arguably maintained and management and restoration efforts are assessed. Here, we show that branching can be present with no associated changes to community dynamics, either locally or in the watershed as a whole when branching affects only dispersal patterns and not environmental structure. We explore violations of these conditions to identify how branching can modify environmental conditions affecting coexistence in the watershed. We show that the strength of coexistence in the watershed depends in all essentials on the amount of environmental heterogeneity with only a small role for other factors. Only when streams are small relative to the scales of environmental change or dispersal can branching affect the strength of watershed-scale coexistence independently of changes to environmental heterogeneity in the watershed, but these effects are small and depend on interactions with environmental variation. We suggest that focusing on environmental heterogeneity rather than branching patterns will yield the greatest understanding of the drivers of stream community structure and the greatest benefits for management and restoration of stream communities.},

Although research indicates that tributary inputs have the potential to dilute these effects, knowledge at the food-web level is still scarce. Here, we examined the riverine food-web structure of the Colorado River below Glen Canyon Dam, focusing on organic matter sources, trophic diversity and food chain length. We asked how these components respond to pulsed flows from tributaries following monsoon thunderstorms that seasonally increase streamflow in the American Southwest. Tributaries increased the relative importance of terrestrial organic matter, particularly during the wet season below junctures of key tributaries. This contrasted with the algal-based food-web present immediately below Glen Canyon Dam. Tributary inputs during the monsoon also increased trophic diversity and food chain length: food chain length peaked below the confluence with the largest tributary (by discharge) in Grand Canyon, increasing by {\textgreater}1 trophic level over a 4–5 km reach possibly due to aquatic prey being flushed into the mainstem during heavy rain events. Our results illustrate that large tributaries can create seasonal discontinuities, influencing riverine food-web structure in terms of allochthony, food-web diversity and food chain length. Synthesis and applications. Pulsed flows from unregulated tributaries following seasonal monsoon rains increase the importance of terrestrially derived organic matter in large, regulated river food webs, increasing food chain length and trophic diversity downstream of tributary inputs. Protecting unregulated tributaries within hydropower cascades may be important if we are to mitigate food-web structure alteration due to flow regulation by large dams. This is critical in the light of global hydropower development, especially in megadiverse, developing countries where dam placement (including completed and planned structures) is in tributaries.},

	volume = {0},
	doi = {doi:10.1111/oik.05937},
	abstract = {Organisms are frequently coinfected by multiple parasite strains and species, and interactions between parasites within hosts are known to influence parasite prevalence and diversity, as well as epidemic timing. Importantly, interactions between coinfecting parasites can be affected by the order in which they infect hosts (i.e. within-host priority effects). In this study, we use a single-host, two-pathogen, SI model with environmental transmission to explore how within-host priority effects scale up to alter host population-scale infection patterns. Specifically, we ask how parasite prevalence changes in the presence of different types of priority effects. We consider two scenarios without priority effects and four scenarios with priority effects where there is either an advantage or a disadvantage to being the first to infect in a coinfected host. Models without priority effects always predict negative relationships between the prevalences of both parasites. In contrast, models with priority effects can yield unimodal prevalence relationships where the prevalence of a focal parasite is minimized or maximized at intermediate prevalences of a coinfecting parasite. The mechanism behind this pattern is that as the prevalence of the coinfecting parasite increases, most infections of the focal parasite change from occurring as solo infections, to first arrival coinfections, to second arrival coinfections. The corresponding changes in parasite fitness as the focal parasite moves from one infection class to another then map to changes in focal parasite prevalence. Further, we found that even when parasites interact negatively within a host, they still can have positive prevalence relationships at the population scale. These results suggest that within-host priority effects can change host population-scale infection patterns in systematic (and initially counterintuitive) ways, and that taking them into account may improve disease forecasting in coinfected populations.

	abstract = {The stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) provide powerful tools for estimating the trophic positions of and carbon flow to consumers in food webs; however, the isotopic signature of a consumer alone is not generally sufficient to infer trophic position or carbon source without an appropriate isotopic baseline. In this paper, I develop and discuss methods for generating an isotopic baseline and evaluate the assumptions required to estimate the trophic position of consumers using stable isotopes in multiple ecosystem studies. I test the ability of two primary consumers, surface-grazing snails and filter-feeding mussels, to capture the spatial and temporal variation at the base of aquatic food webs. I find that snails reflect the isotopic signature of the base of the littoral food web, mussels reflect the isotopic signature of the pelagic food web, and together they provide a good isotopic baseline for estimating trophic position of secondary or higher trophic level consumers in lake ecosystems. Then, using data from 25 north temperate lakes, I evaluate how δ15N and δ13C of the base of aquatic food webs varies both among lakes and between the littoral and pelagic food webs within lakes. Using data from the literature, I show that the mean trophic fractionation of δ15N is 3.4‰ (1 sd = 1‰) and of δ13C is 0.4‰ (1 sd = 1.3‰), and that both, even though variable, are widely applicable. A sensitivity analysis reveals that estimates of trophic position are very sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of δ15N, moderately sensitive to different methods for generating an isotopic baseline, and not sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of δ13C when δ13C is used to estimate the proportion of nitrogen in a consumer derived from two sources. Finally, I compare my recommendations for generating an isotopic baseline to an alternative model proposed by M. J. Vander Zanden and J. B. Rasmussen. With an appropriate isotopic baseline and an appreciation of the underlying assumptions and model sensitivity, stable isotopes can help answer some of the most difficult questions in food web ecology.},

	abstract = {Abstract Population dynamics are often correlated in space and time due to correlations in environmental drivers as well as synchrony induced by individual dispersal. Many statistical analyses of populations ignore potential autocorrelations and assume that survey methods (distance and time between samples) eliminate these correlations, allowing samples to be treated independently. If these assumptions are incorrect, results and therefore inference may be biased and uncertainty underestimated. We developed a novel statistical method to account for spatiotemporal correlations within dendritic stream networks, while accounting for imperfect detection in the surveys. Through simulations, we found this model decreased predictive error relative to standard statistical methods when data were spatially correlated based on stream distance and performed similarly when data were not correlated. We found that increasing the number of years surveyed substantially improved the model accuracy when estimating spatial and temporal correlation coefficients, especially from 10 to 15 yr. Increasing the number of survey sites within the network improved the performance of the nonspatial model but only marginally improved the density estimates in the spatiotemporal model. We applied this model to brook trout data from the West Susquehanna Watershed in Pennsylvania collected over 34 yr from 1981 to 2014. We found the model including temporal and spatiotemporal autocorrelation best described young of the year (YOY) and adult density patterns. YOY densities were positively related to forest cover and negatively related to spring temperatures with low temporal autocorrelation and moderately high spatiotemporal correlation. Adult densities were less strongly affected by climatic conditions and less temporally variable than YOY but with similar spatiotemporal correlation and higher temporal autocorrelation.},

	abstract = {Niche-based selection and stochastic processes can operate simultaneously to generate spatial and temporal variation in species composition. Yet, the conditions under which ecological dynamics are dominated by niche-based versus stochastic processes are poorly understood. Using a field experiment in early-successional temperate grassland and null models of beta diversity, this study investigates the effects of soil nutrient supply on the relative importance of niche-based selection versus stochastic dynamics for variation in species composition among sites. Nutrient availability was manipulated experimentally, individual seed mixtures with 25 species were sown in each experimental plot, and then stochastic and deterministic niche-based assembly processes were allowed to happen. We found that compositional variation among grassland plots with low nutrient supply was driven by stochastic immigration and extinctions. In contrast, nutrient enrichment reduced the importance of stochasticity and imposed a deterministic environmental filter that homogenized communities through the selection of few species with greater competitive ability for light. This demonstrates that soil nutrient availability is a critical environmental feature that dictates the degree to which terrestrial plant communities are controlled by niche-based selection versus stochastic assembly processes. Our study shows further that alternative states of eutrophic grasslands emerge from initial stochastic variation in the composition of a particular functional group of species that can become dominant at high nutrient supply. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying the shift from stochastic to niche-driven dynamics along soil nutrient gradients.},

	abstract = {Understanding species’ responses to environmental conditions, and how these species–environment associations shape spatial distributions, are longstanding goals in ecology and biogeography. However, an essential component of species–environment relationships – the spatial unit, or grain, at which they operate – remains unresolved. We identify three components of scale-dependence in analyses of species–environment associations: 1) response grain, the grain at which species respond most strongly to their environment; 2) environment spatial structure, the pattern of spatial autocorrelation intrinsic to an environmental factor; and 3) analysis grain, the grain at which analyses are conducted and ecological inferences are made. We introduce a novel conceptual framework that defines these scale components in the context of analyzing species–environment relationships, and provide theoretical examples of their interactions for species with various ecological attributes. We then use a virtual species approach to investigate the impacts of each component on common methods of measuring and predicting species–environment relationships. We find that environment spatial structure has a substantial impact on the ability of even simple, univariate species distribution models (SDMs) to recover known species–environment associations at coarse analysis grains. For simulated environments with ‘fine’ and ‘intermediate’ spatial structure, model explanatory power, and the frequency with which simple SDMs correctly estimated a virtual species’ response to the simulated environment, dramatically declined as analysis grain increased. Informed by these results, we use a scaling analysis to identify maximum analysis grains for individual environmental factors, and a scale optimization procedure to determine the grain of maximum predictive accuracy. Implementing these analysis grain thresholds and model performance standards in an example east African study system yields more accurate distribution predictions, compared to SDMs independently constructed at arbitrary analysis grains. Finally, we integrate our conceptual framework with virtual and empirical results to provide practical recommendations for researchers asking common questions about species–environment relationships.},

Streams affected by coal mining averaged one-third (32\%) lower taxonomic richness and one-half (53\%) lower total abundance than unmined streams, with these impacts occurring across all taxa investigated thus far (invertebrates, fish, and salamanders).

	abstract = {Because biodiversity is multidimensional and scale-dependent, it is challenging to estimate its change. However, it is unclear (1) how much scale-dependence matters for empirical studies, and (2) if it does matter, how exactly we should quantify biodiversity change. To address the first question, we analysed studies with comparisons among multiple assemblages, and found that rarefaction curves frequently crossed, implying reversals in the ranking of species richness across spatial scales. Moreover, the most frequently measured aspect of diversity - species richness - was poorly correlated with other measures of diversity. Second, we collated studies that included spatial scale in their estimates of biodiversity change in response to ecological drivers and found frequent and strong scale-dependence, including nearly 10\% of studies which showed that biodiversity changes switched directions across scales. Having established the complexity of empirical biodiversity comparisons, we describe a synthesis of methods based on rarefaction curves that allow more explicit analyses of spatial and sampling effects on biodiversity comparisons. We use a case study of nutrient additions in experimental ponds to illustrate how this multi-dimensional and multi-scale perspective informs the responses of biodiversity to ecological drivers.},

	abstract = {Theoretical studies of ecosystem models have generally concluded that large numbers of species will not stably coexist if the species are all competing for the same limited set of resources. Here, we describe a simple multi-trait model of competition where the presence of N resources will lead to the stable coexistence of up to 2N species. Our model also predicts that the long-term dynamics of the population will lie on a neutral attractor hyperplane. When the population shifts within the hyperplane, its dynamics will behave neutrally, while shifts which occur perpendicular to the hyperplane will be subject to restoring forces. This provides a potential explanation of why complex ecosystems might exhibit both niche-like and neutral responses to perturbations. Like the neutral theory of biodiversity, our model generates good fits to species abundance distributions in several datasets but does so without needing to evoke inter-generational stochastic effects, continuous species creation or immigration dynamics. Additionally, our model is able to explain species abundance correlations between independent but similar ecosystems separated by more than 1400 km inside the Amazonian forests.},

	abstract = {Unraveling the relationship between demographic declines and genetic changes over time is of critical importance to predict the persistence of at-risk populations and to propose efficient conservation plans. This is particularly relevant in spatially structured populations (i.e. metapopulations) in which the spatial arrangement of local populations can modulate both demographic and genetic changes. We used ten-year demo-genetic monitoring to test 1) whether demographic declines were associated with genetic diversity declines and 2) whether the spatial structure of a metapopulation can weaken or reinforce these demographic and genetic temporal trends. We continuously surveyed, over time and across their entire range, two metapopulations of an endemic freshwater fish species Leuciscus burdigalensis: one metapopulation that had experienced a recent demographic decline and a second metapopulation that was stable over time. In the declining metapopulation, the number of alleles rapidly decreased, the inbreeding coefficient increased, and a genetic bottleneck emerged over time. In contrast, genetic indices were constant over time in the stable metapopulation. We further show that, in the declining metapopulation, demographic and genetic declines were not homogeneously distributed across the metapopulation. We notably identify one local population situated downstream as a ‘reservoir’ of individuals and genetic variability that dampens both the demographic and genetic declines measured at the metapopulation level. We demonstrate the usefulness of long-term monitoring that combines both genetic and demographic parameters to understand and predict temporal population fluctuations of at-risk species living in a metapopulation context.

In a 6-month field experiment, we test which attributes of foundation species patch configuration – i.e. patch size, total patch area, perimeter, area-perimeter ratio, or connectivity – control biodiversity, stability and multifunctionality by adding a standardised density of mussel foundation species in patches of 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, 90 or 180 individuals to a southeastern US salt marsh. Over 67\% of response variables increased with clustering of mussels, responses that were driven by increases in area–perimeter ratio (33\%), decreases in perimeter (29\%), or increases in patch size (5\%), suggesting sensitivity to external stressors and/or dependence on foundation species-derived niche availability and segregation. Thus, mussel configuration – by controlling the relative distribution of multidimensional patch interior and edge niche space – critically modulates this foundation species’ effects on ecosystem structure, stability and function.},

	abstract = {Abiotic conditions have long been considered essential in structuring freshwater macroinvertebrate communities. Ecological drift, dispersal and biotic interactions also structure communities, and although these mechanisms are more difficult to detect, they may be of equal importance in natural communities. Here, we hypothesized that in 10 naturally replicated headwater streams in eastern Switzerland, locally dominant amphipod species would be associated with differences in environmental conditions. We conducted repeated surveys of amphipods and used a hierarchical joint species distribution model to assess the influence of different drivers on species co-occurrences. The species had unique environmental requirements, but a distinct spatial structure in their distributions was unrelated to habitat. Species co-occurred much less frequently than predicted by the model, which was surprising because laboratory and field evidence suggests they are capable of coexisting in equal densities. We suggest that niche preemption may limit their distribution and that a blocking effect related to the specific linear configuration of streams determines which species colonizes and dominates a given stream catchment, thus suggesting a new solution a long-standing conundrum in freshwater ecology.},

	abstract = {β-diversity represents the compositional variation among communities from site-to-site, linking local (α-diversity) and regional (γ-diversity). Researchers often desire to compare values of β-diversity across localities or experimental treatments, and to use this comparison to infer possible mechanisms of community assembly. However, the majority of metrics used to estimate β-diversity, including most dissimilarity metrics (e.g., Jaccard's and Sørenson's dissimilarity index), can vary simply because of changes in the other two diversity components (α or γ-diversity). Here, we overview the utility of taking a null model approach that allows one to discern whether variation in the measured dissimilarity among communities results more from changes in the underlying structure by which communities vary, or instead simply due to difference in α-diversity among localities or experimental treatments. We illustrate one particular approach, originally developed by Raup and Crick (1979) in the paleontological literature, which creates a re-scaled probability metric ranging from −1 to 1, indicating whether local communities are more dissimilar (approaching 1), as dissimilar (approaching 0), or less dissimilar (approaching −1), than expected by random chance. The value of this metric provides some indication of the possible underlying mechanisms of community assembly, in particular the degree to which deterministic processes create communities that deviate from those based on stochastic (null) expectations. We demonstrate the utility of this metric when compared to analyses of Jaccard's dissimilarity index with case studies from disparate empirical systems (coral reefs and freshwater ponds) that differ in the degree to which disturbance altered α-diversity, as well as the selectivity by which disturbance acted on members of the community.},

We censused macroinvertebrate communities and measured flood disturbance in 17 Scandinavian mountain streams to assess the hypothesis that communities are shaped by stochastic processes under stable conditions, and increasingly by deterministic processes as disturbance becomes more severe. Each study stream was categorized as being stable (n=5), intermediate (n=7), or disturbed (n=5) depending on the severity of scouring floods. Following spring floods, the number of potential colonisers decreased with increasing disturbance, suggesting that disturbance filtered out species unable to cope with the stress involved. Communities at stable sites had the highest beta diversity, indicating that stochastic processes of community assembly were most important under the least disturbed conditions. In partial contrast with our predictions, the lowest beta diversity occurred between intermediate (not disturbed) sites, suggesting that increasing disturbance first enhances determinism but then rekindles stochasticity at severity levels beyond intermediate. Macroinvertebrate communities were shaped by deterministic processes, which recruit potential regional colonists depending on niche differences and disturbance conditions and by stochastic processes, which distribute the selected species randomly among individual localities. Although often considered opposing, stochastic and deterministic processes interact hierarchically, with relative strength modified by disturbance.},

	doi = {doi:10.1111/jvs.12551},
	abstract = {Abstract Aims Environmental variability (e.g. in precipitation) has a large effect on vegetation dynamics, and this often makes it difficult to assess the recovery of vegetation after a disturbance. In this study, we assessed vegetation recovery trends in response to grazing exclusion while considering for the annual environmental variability. Location Two regions with highly variable precipitation: a steppe near Mandalgobi, in Mongolia's Central Gobi province, and a desert steppe near Bulgan, in Mongolia's South Gobi province. Methods Changes in vegetation were observed along grazing gradients at the above two sites, and vegetation thresholds were identified. We established reference plots in pre-threshold areas along the grazing gradients. We removed the impact of livestock grazing at various locations along the grazing gradients by establishing exclosures, and investigated vegetation from 2005 to 2013. We developed a smoothed hierarchical model within a Bayesian framework, and examined the effect of grazing exclusion on vegetation, focusing especially on the extent of grass cover recovery. In addition, we compared soil nutrient conditions in the reference plots and inside and outside each exclosure along the grazing gradients. Results Temporal trends in the cover of perennial grass in each plot inside and outside of the exclosures largely coincided, irrespective of grazing intensity, and exclosure had no effect (Bulgan) or a negative effect (Mandalgobi) on vegetation recovery. Soil nutrient content was not significantly affected by exclosure at a given distance from the grazing source, but decreased significantly with decreasing grazing intensity. Thus, recovery of the land from a post-threshold state may not be apparent even after 9 yr of grazing exclusion in environments with highly variable precipitation. Conclusion The effect of exclosure duration on perennial grass cover was limited, even after controlling for environmental variability. Once a vegetation threshold has been crossed, merely removing livestock from the landscape may not be sufficient for that area to recover.},

	abstract = {Climate change is rapidly altering the global water cycle, exposing vulnerabilities in both social and environmental systems. However, uncertainty in future climate predictions makes it difficult to design and evaluate strategies for building climate resilience. In regions such as California, characterized by stressed water-supply systems, high natural climate variability, and substantial uncertainty in future precipitation projections, alternative approaches to assessing climate risks may be useful. Here, we develop a hydrologic sensitivity approach to estimate regional streamflow responses to climate change in California. We use statistical models to predict monthly streamflow from physical catchment features and evaluate how flow changes with incremental changes in precipitation and temperature. The results indicate unique regional and monthly flow responses to climate change, with early summer flows (May–July) in interior mountain region having the greatest sensitivity to temperature and winter flows (December–March) in the xeric region having the greatest sensitivity to precipitation. When evaluated over the range of global climate model projections for mid-century (2040–2069), models generally suggest shifts in streamflow regimes towards higher wet season flows and lower dry season flows relative to historical conditions. The sensitivity analysis provides insight into catchment- and regional-scale hydrologic responses in California and complements other approaches for understanding the consequences of climatic change for water and risk management.},

	abstract = {Aim Current weaknesses of diversity theory include: a failure to distinguish different biogeographical response variables under the general heading of diversity; and a general failure of ecological theory to deal adequately with geographical scale. Our aim is to articulate the case for a top-down approach to theory building, in which scale is addressed explicitly and in which different response variables are clearly distinguished. Location The article draws upon both theoretical contributions and empirical analyses from all latitudes, focusing on terrestrial ecosystems and with some bias towards (woody) plants. Methods We review current diversity theory and terminology in relation to scale of applicability. As a starting point in developing a general theory, we take the issue of geographical gradients in species richness as a main theme and evaluate the extent to which commonly cited theories are likely to operate at scales from the macro down to the local. Results A degree of confusion surrounds the use of the terms alpha, beta and gamma diversity, and the terms local, landscape and macro-scale are preferred here as a more intuitive framework. The distinction between inventory and differentiation diversity is highlighted as important as, in terms of scale of analysis, are the concepts of focus and extent. The importance of holding area constant in analysis is stressed, as is the notion that different environmental factors exhibit measurable heterogeneity at different scales. Evaluation of several of the most common diversity theories put forward for the grand clines in species richness, indicates that they can be collapsed to dynamic hypotheses based on climate or historical explanations. The importance of the many ecological/biological mechanisms that have been proposed is evident mainly at local scales of analysis, whilst at the macro-scale they are dependent largely upon climatic controls for their operation. Local communities have often been found not to be saturated, i.e. to be non-equilibrial. This is argued, perhaps counter-intuitively, to be entirely compatible with the persistence through time of macro-scale patterns of richness that are climatically determined. The review also incorporates recent developments in macroecology, Rapoport’s rule, trade-offs, and the importance of isolation, landscape impedance and geometric constraints on richness (the mid-domain effect) in generating richness patterns; highlighting those phenomena that are contributory to the first-order climatic pattern, and those, such as the geometric constraints, that may confound or obscure these patterns. Main conclusions A general theory of diversity must necessarily cover many disparate phenomena, at various scales of analysis, and cannot therefore be expressed in a simple formula, but individual elements of this general theory may be. In particular, it appears possible to capture in a dynamic climate-based model and ‘capacity rule’, the form of the grand cline in richness of woody plants at the macro-scale. This provides a starting point for a top-down, global-to-local, macro-to-micro scale approach to modelling richness variations in a variety of taxa. Patterns in differentiation/endemicity, on the other hand, require more immediate attention to historical events, and to features of geography such as isolation. Thus, whilst we argue that there are basic physical principles and laws underlying certain diversity phenomena (e.g. macro-scale richness gradients), a pluralistic body of theory is required that incorporates dynamic and historical explanation, and which bridges equilibrial and nonequilibrial concepts and ideas.},

	volume = {40},
	doi = {doi:10.1111/ecog.01942},
	abstract = {Several indices measure the association or segregation between two species and the similarity or differentiation between two sets of species. These indices are based on the overlap in the distribution of species (measured with the number of co-occurrences) or on the overlap in species composition of sites (measured with the number of species that are shared between two sites). This paper shows that when evaluating more than two species the number of overlaps and the number of pairwise co-occurrences are not equal, as it is the case for two species. Equivalently, when comparing more than two species assemblages, the number of overlaps differ from the number of instances of species sharing by pairs of sites (the ‘co-diversities’). Considering this distinction, two different types of multispecies and multisite indices can be derived: indices of general overlap and indices of co-occurrence or co-diversity. Here I present a complete series of the two types of indices that correspond to the popular Jaccard, Sørensen, and Simpson two-species or two-site indices. Indices of general overlap are defined by three parameters (the total number of species, the total number of sites, and the total number of occurrences), whereas indices of co-occurrence or co-diversity depend on those parameters plus an additional one that is defined by the values of species richness or range size. Consequently, the two types of indices respond differently to null models, depending on the parameters that are fixed or randomized. All indices correlate well with the mean of the traditional indices calculated pair by pair, and the correspondence is extremely close for the new indices of co-occurrence and co-diversity. These properties should be useful in clarifying some of the confusion that exists in the current discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of pairwise vs community-wide approaches in the analysis of diversity.},

	abstract = {Biotic connectivity between ecosystems can provide major transport of organic matter and nutrients, influencing ecosystem structure and productivity1, yet the implications are poorly understood owing to human disruptions of natural flows2. When abundant, seabirds feeding in the open ocean transport large quantities of nutrients onto islands, enhancing the productivity of island fauna and flora3,4. Whether leaching of these nutrients back into the sea influences the productivity, structure and functioning of adjacent coral reef ecosystems is not known. Here we address this question using a rare natural experiment in the Chagos Archipelago, in which some islands are rat-infested and others are rat-free. We found that seabird densities and nitrogen deposition rates are 760 and 251 times higher, respectively, on islands where humans have not introduced rats. Consequently, rat-free islands had substantially higher nitrogen stable isotope (δ15N) values in soils and shrubs, reflecting pelagic nutrient sources. These higher values of δ15N were also apparent in macroalgae, filter-feeding sponges, turf algae and fish on adjacent coral reefs. Herbivorous damselfish on reefs adjacent to the rat-free islands grew faster, and fish communities had higher biomass across trophic feeding groups, with 48\% greater overall biomass. Rates of two critical ecosystem functions, grazing and bioerosion, were 3.2 and 3.8 times higher, respectively, adjacent to rat-free islands. Collectively, these results reveal how rat introductions disrupt nutrient flows among pelagic, island and coral reef ecosystems. Thus, rat eradication on oceanic islands should be a high conservation priority as it is likely to benefit terrestrial ecosystems and enhance coral reef productivity and functioning by restoring seabird-derived nutrient subsidies from large areas of ocean.},

	abstract = {Abstract Habitat fragmentation and climate change are both prominent manifestations of global change, but there is little knowledge on the specific mechanisms of how climate change may modify the effects of habitat fragmentation, for example, by altering dynamics of spatially structured populations. The long-term viability of metapopulations is dependent on independent dynamics of local populations, because it mitigates fluctuations in the size of the metapopulation as a whole. Metapopulation viability will be compromised if climate change increases spatial synchrony in weather conditions associated with population growth rates. We studied a recently reported increase in metapopulation synchrony of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) in the Finnish archipelago, to see if it could be explained by an increase in synchrony of weather conditions. For this, we used 23 years of butterfly survey data together with monthly weather records for the same period. We first examined the associations between population growth rates within different regions of the metapopulation and weather conditions during different life-history stages of the butterfly. We then examined the association between the trends in the synchrony of the weather conditions and the synchrony of the butterfly metapopulation dynamics. We found that precipitation from spring to late summer are associated with the M. cinxia per capita growth rate, with early summer conditions being most important. We further found that the increase in metapopulation synchrony is paralleled by an increase in the synchrony of weather conditions. Alternative explanations for spatial synchrony, such as increased dispersal or trophic interactions with a specialist parasitoid, did not show paralleled trends and are not supported. The climate driven increase in M. cinxia metapopulation synchrony suggests that climate change can increase extinction risk of spatially structured populations living in fragmented landscapes by altering their dynamics.},

Differences in offspring phenotypes have attracted little attention in this context. We model a scenario where the rarer habitat improves offspring's later competitive ability – a carryover effect that operates on top of local adaptation to one or the other habitat type. Assuming localised dispersal, so the offspring tend to settle in similar habitat to the natal type, the superior competitive ability of offspring remaining in the rarer habitat hampers immigration from the majority habitat. This initiates a positive feedback between local adaptation and trait divergence, which can thereafter be reinforced by coevolution with dispersal traits that match ecotype to habitat type. Rarity strengthens selection on dispersal traits and promotes linkage disequilibrium between locally adapted traits and ecotype-habitat matching dispersal. We propose that carryover effects may initiate isolation by ecology.},

Using a novel approach to analyse long-term data of 66 amphibian species pairs across eight communities, we demonstrate that phenological shifts can significantly alter the interaction potential of coexisting competitors. Importantly, these changes in interaction potential were mediated by non-uniform, species-specific shifts in entire phenological distributions and consequently could not be captured by metrics traditionally used to quantify phenological shifts. Ultimately, these non-uniform shifts in phenological distributions increased the interaction potential for 25\% of species pairs (and did not reduce interaction potential for any species pair), altering temporal community structure and potentially increasing interspecific competition. These results demonstrate the potential of phenological shifts to reshape temporal structure of natural communities, emphasising the importance of considering entire phenological distributions of natural populations.},

As the need for biodiversity assessments increases in the face of accelerated global change, novel approaches that are rapid, repeatable and scalable are critical, especially in ecosystems for which information about species identity and the number of species is difficult to acquire. Here, we present 'spectral diversity'-a spectroscopic index of the variability of electromagnetic radiation reflected from plants measured in the visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared regions (400-2,400 nm). Using data collected from the Cedar Creek biodiversity experiment (Minnesota, USA), we provide evidence that the dissimilarity of species' leaf spectra increases with functional dissimilarity and evolutionary divergence time. Spectral diversity at the leaf level explains 51\% of total variation in productivity-a proportion comparable to taxonomic (47\%), functional (51\%) or phylogenetic diversity (48\%)-and performs similarly when calculated from high-resolution canopy image spectra. Spectral diversity is an emerging dimension of plant biodiversity that integrates trait variation within and across species even in the absence of taxonomic, functional, phylogenetic or abundance information, and has the potential to transform biodiversity assessment because of its scalability to remote sensing.},

However, the susceptible scale of β diversity to agricultural impacts and the indirect effects on β diversity within hierarchically nested ecosystems are unclear. We first tested the hypothesis that β diversity between microhabitats is significantly influenced by agricultural land use. We also examined the indirect effects of agricultural land use on α and β diversities at the microhabitat scale. Twelve microhabitat samples (25 cm2) were collected at 27 reaches within Kitamihorobetsu River, Japan. All reaches were classified into three agricultural intensities based on pasture area (low, middle, and high), and their hierarchical diversities (microhabitat, reach, and catchment) were calculated using additive partitioning. Indirect effects were demonstrated by structural equation modelling using indirect and direct environmental gradients. The α and β diversities at the microhabitat scale decreased significantly with agricultural intensity. Increasing pasture cover within catchments showed a negative correlation with habitat heterogeneity and water quality (habitat homogenization and water degradation) and a positive correlation with sand cover on streambeds (sedimentation of fine particles). The α diversity decreased with sedimentation of fine particles, and the β diversity decreased with habitat homogenization and water degradation. Our findings suggest that species diversity of aquatic insects at the microhabitat scale would be susceptible to agricultural land use. Furthermore, we emphasize that the diversity index used to evaluate restoration projects should be carefully selected because influential abiotic factors were different between α and β diversities.},

	abstract = {Fluctuating environmental conditions are thought to be important for the maintenance of species diversity, and yet our understanding of the relative contribution of different fluctuation-dependent coexistence mechanisms (the temporal storage effect and relative nonlinearity of competition) in real systems is limited. Using experiments and simulations, we show that both mechanisms consistently affect coexistence and that, contrary to long-held assumptions, the effect of relative nonlinearity can be larger in magnitude. These results may be general in that the simultaneous emergence of both mechanisms rests on two factors common to nearly all ecological systems, from the human gut to the soil microbiome: variable environmental conditions and saturating population growth rates.Understanding the origins and maintenance of biodiversity remains one of biology’s grand challenges. From theory and observational evidence, we know that variability in environmental conditions through time is likely critical to the coexistence of competing species. Nevertheless, experimental tests of fluctuation-driven coexistence are rare and have typically focused on just one of two potential mechanisms, the temporal storage effect, to the neglect of the theoretically equally plausible mechanism known as relative nonlinearity of competition. We combined experiments and simulations in a system of nectar yeasts to quantify the relative contribution of the two mechanisms to coexistence. Resource competition models parameterized from single-species assays predicted the outcomes of mixed-culture competition experiments with 83\% accuracy. Model simulations revealed that both mechanisms have measurable effects on coexistence and that relative nonlinearity can be equal or greater in magnitude to the temporal storage effect. In addition, we show that their effect on coexistence can be both antagonistic and complementary. These results falsify the common assumption that relative nonlinearity is of negligible importance, and in doing so reveal the importance of testing coexistence mechanisms in combination.},

	abstract = {Poison dart frogs are well known for their deadly toxins and bright colors; they are a classic example of warning coloration. However, conspicuousness is not the only consideration; defensive coloration must be effective against a diverse predator community with a variety of different visual systems, and variable knowledge of prey defenses and motivation to attack. We found that the bright colors of Dendrobates tinctorius are highly salient at close-range but blend together to match the background when viewed from a distance. D. tinctorius combines aposematism and camouflage without necessarily compromising the efficacy of either strategy, producing bright colors while reducing encounters with predators. These data highlight the importance of incorporating viewing distance and pattern distribution into studies of signal design.Poison dart frogs provide classic examples of warning signals: potent toxins signaled by distinctive, conspicuous coloration. We show that, counterintuitively, the bright yellow and blue-black color of Dendrobates tinctorius (Dendrobatidae) also provides camouflage. Through computational modeling of predator vision, and a screen-based detection experiment presenting frogs at different spatial resolutions, we demonstrate that at close range the frog is highly detectable, but from a distance the colors blend together, forming effective camouflage. This result was corroborated with an in situ experiment, which found survival to be background-dependent, a feature more associated with camouflage than aposematism. Our results suggest that in D. tinctorius the distribution of pattern elements, and the particular colors expressed, act as a highly salient close range aposematic signal, while simultaneously minimizing detectability to distant observers.},

These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1) Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species, ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem‐level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well‐documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. Ho ever, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental work, especially field research. We need long‐term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision‐making.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recent work linking community structure and ecosystem function has primarily focused on the effects of local species richness but has neglected the dispersal‐dependent processes of community assembly that are ultimately involved in determining community structure and its relation to ecosystems. Here we combine simple consumer‐resource competition models and metacommunity theory with discussion of case studies to outline how spatial processes within metacommunities can alter community assembly and modify expectations about how species diversity and composition influence ecosystem attributes at local scales. We argue that when community assembly is strongly limited by dispersal, this can constrain ecosystem functioning by reducing positive selection effects (reducing the probability of the most productive species becoming dominant) even though it may often also enhance complementarity (favoring combinations of species that enhance production even though they may not individually be most productive). Conversely, excess dispersal with strong source‐sink relations among heterogeneous habitats can reduce ecosystem functioning by swamping local filters that would normally favor better‐suited species. Ecosystem function is thus most likely maximized at intermediate levels of dispersal where both of these effects are minimized. In this scenario, we find that the selection effect is maximized, while complementarity is often reduced and local diversity may often be relatively low. Our synthesis emphasizes that it is the entire set of community assembly processes that affect the functioning of ecosystems, not just the part that determines local species richness.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) applies mainly to fine spatial scales. New research is required if we are to extend this knowledge to broader spatial scales that are relevant for conservation decisions. Here, we use simulations to examine conditions that generate scale dependence of the BEF relationship. We study scale by assessing how the BEF relationship (slope and R2) changes when habitat patches are spatially aggregated. We find three ways for the BEF relationship to be scale-dependent: (i) variation among local patches in local (α) diversity, (ii) spatial variation in the local BEF relationship and (iii) incomplete compositional turnover in species composition among patches. The first two cause the slope of the BEF relationship to increase moderately with spatial scale, reflecting nonlinear averaging of spatial variation in diversity or the BEF relationship. The third mechanism results in much stronger scale dependence, with the BEF relationship increasing in the rising portion of the species area relationship, but then decreasing as it saturates. An analysis of data from the Cedar Creek grassland BEF experiment revealed a positive but saturating slope of the relationship with scale. Overall, our findings suggest that the BEF relationship is likely to be scale dependent.},

	abstract = {Abstract In the face of global climate change, organisms may respond to temperature increases by shifting their ranges poleward or to higher altitudes. However, the direction of range shifts in riverine systems is less clear. Because rivers are dendritic networks, there is only one dispersal route from any given location to another. Thus, range shifts are only possible if branches are connected by suitable habitat, and stream‐dwelling organisms can disperse through these branches. We used Cumberlandia monodonta (Bivalvia: Unionoida: Margaritiferidae) as a model species to investigate the effects of climate change on population connectivity because a majority of contemporary populations are panmictic. We combined ecological niche models (ENMs) with population genetic simulations to investigate the effects of climate change on population connectivity and genetic diversity of C. monodonta. The ENMs were constructed using bioclimatic and landscape data to project shifts in suitable habitat under future climate scenarios. We then used forward‐time simulations to project potential changes in genetic diversity and population connectivity based on these range shifts. ENM results under current conditions indicated long stretches of highly suitable habitat in rivers where C. monodonta persists; populations in the upper Mississippi River remain connected by suitable habitat that does not impede gene flow. Future climate scenarios projected northward and headwater‐ward range contraction and drastic declines in habitat suitability for most extant populations throughout the Mississippi River Basin. Simulations indicated that climate change would greatly reduce genetic diversity and connectivity across populations. Results suggest that a single, large population of C. monodonta will become further fragmented into smaller populations, each of which will be isolated and begin to differentiate genetically. Because C. monodonta is a widely distributed species and purely aquatic, our results suggest that persistence and connectivity of stream‐dwelling organisms will be significantly altered in response to future climate change.},

	abstract = {Abstract Global climate change is likely to modify the ecological consequences of currently acting stressors, but potentially important interactions between climate warming and land‐use related stressors remain largely unknown. Agriculture affects streams and rivers worldwide, including via nutrient enrichment and increased fine sediment input. We manipulated nutrients (simulating agricultural run‐off) and deposited fine sediment (simulating agricultural erosion) (two levels each) and water temperature (eight levels, 0–6°C above ambient) simultaneously in 128 streamside mesocosms to determine the individual and combined effects of the three stressors on macroinvertebrate community dynamics (community composition and body size structure of benthic, drift and insect emergence assemblages). All three stressors had pervasive individual effects, but in combination often produced additive or antagonistic outcomes. Changes in benthic community composition showed a complex interplay among habitat quality (with or without sediment), resource availability (with or without nutrient enrichment) and the behavioural/physiological tendency to drift or emerge as temperature rose. The presence of sediment and raised temperature both resulted in a community of smaller organisms. Deposited fine sediment strongly increased the propensity to drift. Stressor effects were most prominent in the benthic assemblage, frequently reflected by opposite patterns in individuals quitting the benthos (in terms of their propensity to drift or emerge). Of particular importance is that community measures of stream health routinely used around the world (taxon richness, EPT richness and diversity) all showed complex three‐way interactions, with either a consistently stronger temperature response or a reversal of its direction when one or both agricultural stressors were also in operation. The negative effects of added fine sediment, which were often stronger at raised temperatures, suggest that streams already impacted by high sediment loads may be further degraded under a warming climate. However, the degree to which this will occur may also depend on in‐stream nutrient conditions.},

Only one region of the Mississippi River basin—the 44,000 km2 Minnesota River basin—still contains enough wetland cover within its intensively agriculturally managed watersheds to empirically address this question. Here we combine high-resolution land cover data for the Minnesota River basin with spatially extensive repeat water sampling data. By clearly isolating the effect of wetlands from crop cover, we show that, under moderate–high streamflow, wetlands are five times more efficient per unit area at reducing riverine nitrate concentration than the most effective land-based nitrogen mitigation strategies, which include cover crops and land retirement.

Our results indicate that the functional redundancy tended to increase with species richness in lakes and rivers, but not in estuaries. We demonstrated that i) in the three systems, some combinations of functional traits are supported by non-redundant species, ii) rare species in rivers and estuaries support singular functions not shared by dominant species, iii) the loss of vulnerable species can induce greater functional alteration in rivers than in lakes and estuaries. Overall, the functional structure of fish assemblages in rivers is weakly buffered against species extinction because vulnerable species support singular functions.

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Pollination services are at risk from land use change and intensification, but responses of individual pollinator species are often variable, making it difficult to detect and understand community‐level impacts on pollination. We investigated changes in community composition and functional diversity of insect pollinator communities under land use change in a highly modified landscape. Location Canterbury region, South Island, New Zealand. Methods We trapped insect pollinators every month for 1 year at 24 sites across four land use types of increasing intensity in New Zealand: gardens with native vegetation, blackcurrant orchards, dairy farms, and rotational cropping farms. We investigated changes in pollinator species and functional richness and differences in species and functional composition. Results Under increasing land use intensity, both species and functional richness declined markedly. Changes in functional richness, however, were overall not significantly different than expected based on the observed declines in species richness. Nevertheless, there was a significant trend towards greater than expected functional richness within less‐intensive land use types and lower than expected functional richness within intensive land use types. The order of species loss under increasing land use intensity was non‐random, as pollinators with a narrow diet breadth, large body size, solitary behaviour and a preference for non‐floral larval food resources were lost first. Main conclusions Our study shows that pollinator species bearing particular trait attributes are susceptible to differences in land use. Our study suggests that pollination services may be more vulnerable to environmental changes and disturbances in more intensive land use types as a result of lower pollinator functional richness.},

	abstract = {Parasites have profound fitness effects on their hosts, yet these are often sub-lethal, making them difficult to understand and quantify. A principal sub-lethal mechanism that reduces fitness is parasite-induced increase in energetic costs of specific behaviours, potentially resulting in changes to time and energy budgets. However, quantifying the influence of parasites on these costs has not been undertaken in free-living animals. We used accelerometers to estimate energy expenditure on flying, diving and resting, in relation to a natural gradient of endo-parasite loads in a wild population of European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis. We found that flight costs were 10\% higher in adult females with higher parasite loads and these individuals spent 44\% less time flying than females with lower parasite loads. There was no evidence for an effect of parasite load on daily energy expenditure, suggesting the existence of an energy ceiling, with the increase in cost of flight compensated for by a reduction in flight duration. These behaviour specific costs of parasitism will have knock-on effects on reproductive success, if constraints on foraging behaviour detrimentally affect provisioning of young. The findings emphasize the importance of natural parasite loads in shaping the ecology and life-history of their hosts, which can have significant population level consequences.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1705944115},
	abstract = {Explaining why there are more species than limiting resources in natural systems constitutes a long-standing challenge among ecologists. Recently, this apparent paradox was resolved theoretically by showing that species can coexist in clumps along niche gradients. However, models demonstrating this effect have failed to account for a ubiquitous feature of nature, namely variability in environmental conditions. This leaves open the question of whether the proposed mechanisms underpinning “lumpy coexistence” apply in nature or arise as a coincidence of modeling frameworks. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of lumpy coexistence in assemblages self-organizing under fluctuating resource supplies. We show that clumps form predictably as the result of the dynamic pattern in ambient resources driven by the most competitive species in the assemblage.The effect of life-history traits on resource competition outcomes is well understood in the context of a constant resource supply. However, almost all natural systems are subject to fluctuations of resources driven by cyclical processes such as seasonality and tidal hydrology. To understand community composition, it is therefore imperative to study the impact of resource fluctuations on interspecies competition. We adapted a well-established resource-competition model to show that fluctuations in inflow concentrations of two limiting resources lead to the survival of species in clumps along the trait axis, consistent with observations of “lumpy coexistence” [Scheffer M, van Nes EH (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103:6230–6235]. A complex dynamic pattern in the available ambient resources arose very early in the self-organization process and dictated the locations of clumps along the trait axis by creating niches that promoted the growth of species with specific traits. This dynamic pattern emerged as the combined result of fluctuations in the inflow of resources and their consumption by the most competitive species that accumulated the bulk of biomass early in assemblage organization. Clumps emerged robustly across a range of periodicities, phase differences, and amplitudes. Given the ubiquity in the real world of asynchronous fluctuations of limiting resources, our findings imply that assemblage organization in clumps should be a common feature in nature.},

The main efforts to answer this question have sought to identify non-random features of ecological systems that can reverse a negative complexity–stability relationship into a positive one, but are far from successful, especially in their generality. Here, using the traditional community matrix analysis, we show that variation in the density dependence of interspecific interactions, which should be ubiquitous in nature, can dramatically affect the complexity–stability relationship. More specifically, we reveal that a positive complexity–stability relationship arises when harmful interspecific effects have larger density dependence than beneficial ones, regardless of the signs (i.e. positive or negative) of their dependence. Furthermore, numerical simulations demonstrated the synergistic stabilizing effect of interaction type diversity and density-dependence variation. Thus, this concept of density-dependence variation advances our understanding of the complexity–stability relationship in the real world.},

	volume = {0},
	doi = {doi:10.1002/ecy.2375},
	abstract = {Abstract Overcompensation occurs when added mortality increases survival to the next life‐cycle stage. Overcompensation can contribute to the Hydra Effect, wherein added mortality increases equilibrium population size. One hypothesis for overcompensation is that added mortality eases density‐dependence, increasing survival to adulthood (“temporal separation of mortality and density dependence”). Mortality early in the life cycle is therefore predicted to cause overcompensation, whereas mortality later in the life cycle is not. Another hypothesis for overcompensation is that threat of mortality (e.g., from predation) causes behavioral changes that reduce overexploitation of resources, allowing resource recovery, and increasing production of adults (“prudent resource exploitation”). Behaviorally active predation cues alone are therefore predicted to cause overcompensation. We tested these predictions in two experiments with larvae of two species of Aedes. As predicted, early mortality yielded greater production of adults, and of adult females, and greater estimated rate of population increase than did later mortality. Addition of water‐borne predation cues usually reduced browsing on surfaces in late‐stage larvae, but contrary to prediction, resulted in neither significantly greater production of adult mosquitoes nor significantly greater estimated rate of increase. Thus we have strong evidence that timing of mortality contributes to overcompensation and the Hydra effect in mosquitoes. Evidence that predation cues alone can result in overcompensation via prudent resource exploitation is lacking. We expect the overcompensation in response to early mortality will be common in organisms with complex life cycles, density dependence among juveniles, and developmental control of populations.

	abstract = {Abstract Climate change and biodiversity loss are expected to simultaneously affect ecosystems, however research on how each driver mediates the effect of the other has been limited in scope. The multiple stressor framework emphasizes non‐additive effects, but biodiversity may also buffer the effects of climate change, and climate change may alter which mechanisms underlie biodiversity–function relationships. Here, we performed an experiment using tank bromeliad ecosystems to test the various ways that rainfall changes and litter diversity may jointly determine ecological processes. Litter diversity and rainfall changes interactively affected multiple functions, but how depends on the process measured. High litter diversity buffered the effects of altered rainfall on detritivore communities, evidence of insurance against impacts of climate change. Altered rainfall affected the mechanisms by which litter diversity influenced decomposition, reducing the importance of complementary attributes of species (complementarity effects), and resulting in an increasing dependence on the maintenance of specific species (dominance effects). Finally, altered rainfall conditions prevented litter diversity from fueling methanogenesis, because such changes in rainfall reduced microbial activity by 58\%. Together, these results demonstrate that the effects of climate change and biodiversity loss on ecosystems cannot be understood in isolation and interactions between these stressors can be multifaceted.},

	abstract = {Abstract Body size is a multi‐functional trait related to various fitness components, but the relative importance of different selection pressures is seldom resolved. In Carabus japonicus beetles, of which the larvae exclusively prey on earthworms, adult body size is related to the presence/absence of a larger congener and habitat temperature. In sympatry, C. japonicus consistently exhibits smaller body size which is effective for avoiding interspecific mating, but in allopatry, it shows size variation unrelated to temperature. Here, we show that this predator–size variation is attributed to prey–size variation, associated with high phylogenetic diversity in earthworm communities. In allopatry, the predator size was larger where larger prey occurred. Larger adult size may have been selected because larger females produce larger larvae, which can subdue larger prey. Thus, in the absence of a larger congener, variation in prey body size had a pronounced effect on geographic body size divergence in C. japonicus.},

Second we demonstrate that parasite diversity, the number of parasite species harboured by a host species, is related to the network position of a host species. Specifically, a host species with high parasite diversity tends to have a wide diet range, occupy a network position close to many prey species, or occupy a network position that can better accumulate resources from species at lower trophic levels. Lastly our results also suggest that a host species with higher vulnerability to predators, being at a network position close to many predatory species, or being involved in many different food chains, tends to be important in parasite transmission.},

	abstract = {Summary Unconstrained ordination is commonly used in ecology to visualize multivariate data, in particular, to visualize the main trends between different sites in terms of their species composition or relative abundance. Methods of unconstrained ordination currently used, such as non‐metric multidimensional scaling, are algorithm‐based techniques developed and implemented without directly accommodating the statistical properties of the data at hand. Failure to account for these key data properties can lead to misleading results. A model‐based approach to unconstrained ordination can address this issue, and in this study, two types of models for ordination are proposed based on finite mixture models and latent variable models. Each method is capable of handling different data types and different forms of species response to latent gradients. Further strengths of the models are demonstrated via example and simulation. Advantages of model‐based approaches to ordination include the following: residual analysis tools for checking assumptions to ensure the fitted model is appropriate for the data; model selection tools to choose the most appropriate model for ordination; methods for formal statistical inference to draw conclusions from the ordination; and improved efficiency, that is model‐based ordination better recovers true relationships between sites, when used appropriately.},

We surveyed birds in abandoned farmlands with different patch area, habitat, and landscape variables in Kushiro district, eastern Hokkaido, northern Japan. We also surveyed birds in 15 ha of the remaining wetlands as a reference habitat. We used abundance-based hierarchical community models (HCMs) to estimate patch-level estimates of abundance of each species based on sampling plots data that only partially covered the studied patches. We observed 14 wetland species and analyzed them with HCMs. Abandoned farmland patch areas had significant positive effects on the densities of two species. Tree densities and shrub coverage exerted positive and negative effects on some species. Amounts of surrounding wetland/grassland had positive effects on many species. Ensemble of species-level models suggested that 24.7 and 10.6 ha of abandoned farmlands would be needed to harbor a comparable total abundance and species richness in 15-ha wetlands, respectively. These required amounts can be increased/decreased depending on the covariates. The use of HCMs allows us to predict species- and community-level responses under varied conditions based on incomplete sampling data. A quantity of 1.6 times larger areas of abandoned farmlands may be required to restore wetland bird communities in eastern Hokkaido.},

	abstract = {AbstractMigration, a widespread animal behavior, can influence how individuals acquire and transmit pathogens. Past work has demonstrated that migration can reduce the costs of pathogen or parasite infection through two processes: migratory escape from infected areas or individuals and migratory culling of infected individuals. Here, we propose a third process: migratory recovery, where infected individuals lose their parasites and recover from infection during migration. Recovery can occur when parasites and/or their intermediate hosts cannot support changes in the migratory host’s internal or external environment during migration. Thus, parasite mortality increases with migration. Although migratory recovery is likely widespread across species, it remains challenging to empirically test it as a selective force promoting migration. We develop a model and determine the conditions under which migratory recovery theoretically favors the evolution of migration. We show that incorporating migratory recovery into a model of migratory escape increases the range of biologically realistic conditions favoring migration and leads to scenarios where partial migration can evolve. Motivated by empirical estimates of infection costs, our model shows how recovery from infection could drive the evolution of migration. We suggest a number of future directions for both theoretical and empirical research in this area.},

	abstract = {Achieving sufficient connectivity between populations is essential for persistence, but costs of dispersal may select against individual traits or behaviours that, if present, would improve connectivity. Existing dispersal models tend to ignore the multitude of risks to individuals: while many assess the effect of mortality costs, there is also a risk of failing to find new habitat, especially when the entire inhabitable area remains both small and fragmented. There are few known rules governing whether individuals evolve to disperse more, or less, than what is ideal for population connectivity and persistence. Here we aim to fill this gap, while also noting that evolution might not only produce suboptimal dispersal behaviour: it also influences individual heterogeneity in dispersal. Intuitively, we might expect heterogeneity to improve connectivity, as some individuals will travel far. However, we show that this is only true if dispersal distances on average are quite short; heterogeneity can also lead to reduced connectivity because it can reduce the proportion of the most profitable (‘safest’) intermediate dispersal distances. In general, our results show that conditions typically associated with conservation concerns (small and fragmented habitats inhabited by a species with a low birth rate) are also ones that are most likely to lead to suboptimal dispersal traits. This prompts the question of assisted dispersal in cases of urgent conservation concern.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1801779115},
	abstract = {Many populations and species have different strategies for maximizing reproductive success in changing environments. For example, some species of plants reproduce only once in their lifetime (annuals), whereas others can reproduce over multiple years (perennials). Such variation can also occur in fishes, and we examine how this variation in life history strategies is maintained in a Pacific salmonid species (Oncorhynchus mykiss). We find that fish that successfully migrate between the ocean and their freshwater spawning grounds multiple times (repeat spawners) have more than twice the lifetime reproductive success of fish that only spawn once (single spawners). We also find a striking pattern of negative frequency-dependent selection in which older, larger females have higher lifetime fitness when they are less abundant.The maintenance of diverse life history strategies within and among species remains a fundamental question in ecology and evolutionary biology. By using a near-complete 16-year pedigree of 12,579 winter-run steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) from the Hood River, Oregon, we examined the continued maintenance of two life history traits: the number of lifetime spawning events (semelparous vs. iteroparous) and age at first spawning (2–5 years). We found that repeat-spawning fish had more than 2.5 times the lifetime reproductive success of single-spawning fish. However, first-time repeat-spawning fish had significantly lower reproductive success than single-spawning fish of the same age, suggesting that repeat-spawning fish forego early reproduction to devote additional energy to continued survival. For single-spawning fish, we also found evidence for a fitness trade-off for age at spawning: older, larger males had higher reproductive success than younger, smaller males. For females, in contrast, we found that 3-year-old fish had the highest mean lifetime reproductive success despite the observation that 4- and 5-year-old fish were both longer and heavier. This phenomenon was explained by negative frequency-dependent selection: as 4- and 5-year-old fish decreased in frequency on the spawning grounds, their lifetime reproductive success became greater than that of the 3-year-old fish. Using a combination of mathematical and individual-based models parameterized with our empirical estimates, we demonstrate that both fitness trade-offs and negative frequency-dependent selection observed in the empirical data can theoretically maintain the diverse life history strategies found in this population.},

We observed that around 28\% of the rare species were common in other habitats (environment), stream sites (space) or years (time). Among the three factors, rarity was mostly explained by habitat type, whereas a significant portion of the rare species in riffles were common in pools, submerged roots of terrestrial plants or in partially submerged moss patches. This result suggests that the presence in non‐optimum habitat is a strong determinant of the rarity observed in natural communities and most rare species are due to sampling artifacts or accidentally sampled transient species.},

	abstract = {Shifts in the timing of species interactions are often cited as a consequence of climate change and, if present, are expected to have wide-reaching implications for ecological communities. Our knowledge about these shifts mostly comes from single systems, which have provided no clear picture, thus limiting our understanding of how species interactions may be responding overall. Using a new global database based on long-term data on the seasonal timing of biological events for pairwise species interactions, we find that the relative timing of interacting species has changed substantially in recent decades. The observed shifts are greater in magnitude than before recent climate change began, suggesting that there will be widespread warming-related shifts in the synchrony of species in the future.Phenological responses to climate change (e.g., earlier leaf-out or egg hatch date) are now well documented and clearly linked to rising temperatures in recent decades. Such shifts in the phenologies of interacting species may lead to shifts in their synchrony, with cascading community and ecosystem consequences. To date, single-system studies have provided no clear picture, either finding synchrony shifts may be extremely prevalent [Mayor SJ, et al. (2017) Sci Rep 7:1902] or relatively uncommon [Iler AM, et al. (2013) Glob Chang Biol 19:2348–2359], suggesting that shifts toward asynchrony may be infrequent. A meta-analytic approach would provide insights into global trends and how they are linked to climate change. We compared phenological shifts among pairwise species interactions (e.g., predator–prey) using published long-term time-series data of phenological events from aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems across four continents since 1951 to determine whether recent climate change has led to overall shifts in synchrony. We show that the relative timing of key life cycle events of interacting species has changed significantly over the past 35 years. Further, by comparing the period before major climate change (pre-1980s) and after, we show that estimated changes in phenology and synchrony are greater in recent decades. However, there has been no consistent trend in the direction of these changes. Our findings show that there have been shifts in the timing of interacting species in recent decades; the next challenges are to improve our ability to predict the direction of change and understand the full consequences for communities and ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Social animals often form long-lasting relationships with fellow group members, usually with close kin. In primates, strong social bonds have been associated with increased longevity, offspring survival and reproductive success. However, little is known about the fitness effects of social bonds between non-kin, especially outside of mammals. In this study, we use long-term field research on a cooperatively breeding bird, the greater ani (Crotophaga major), to ask whether adult females benefit by remaining in long-term associations with unrelated, co-breeding females. We find that females that have previously nested together synchronize their reproduction more rapidly than those nesting with unfamiliar partners, which leads to lower competition and higher fledging success. Importantly, although previous experience with a co-breeding female influenced reproductive synchrony, the degree of reproductive synchrony did not influence whether co-breeding females remained together in subsequent years, ruling out the alternate hypothesis that highly synchronized females are simply more likely to remain together. These results indicate that switching groups is costly to females, and that social familiarity improves reproductive coordination. Stable social relationships therefore have significant fitness consequences for cooperatively nesting female birds, suggesting that direct benefits alone may favour the evolution of associations between non-relatives and contribute to long-term group stability.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1716825115},
	abstract = {Initial species loss can lead to follow-on extinctions because of the interconnectedness of species in ecosystems. The loss of biodiversity through human impact can change the structure of ecological communities, which, models predict, can affect the likelihood of secondary extinctions. Uniquely, we provide an empirical demonstration of this with a plant-insect food web experiment by focusing on a particular secondary extinction mechanism. This mechanistic approach leads to specific, empirically testable hypotheses that can inform the development of predictive models on the consequences of changes in ecological community structure.Current species extinction rates are at unprecedentedly high levels. While human activities can be the direct cause of some extinctions, it is becoming increasingly clear that species extinctions themselves can be the cause of further extinctions, since species affect each other through the network of ecological interactions among them. There is concern that the simplification of ecosystems, due to the loss of species and ecological interactions, increases their vulnerability to such secondary extinctions. It is predicted that more complex food webs will be less vulnerable to secondary extinctions due to greater trophic redundancy that can buffer against the effects of species loss. Here, we demonstrate in a field experiment with replicated plant-insect communities, that the probability of secondary extinctions is indeed smaller in food webs that include trophic redundancy. Harvesting one species of parasitoid wasp led to secondary extinctions of other, indirectly linked, species at the same trophic level. This effect was markedly stronger in simple communities than for the same species within a more complex food web. We show that this is due to functional redundancy in the more complex food webs and confirm this mechanism with a food web simulation model by highlighting the importance of the presence and strength of trophic links providing redundancy to those links that were lost. Our results demonstrate that biodiversity loss, leading to a reduction in redundant interactions, can increase the vulnerability of ecosystems to secondary extinctions, which, when they occur, can then lead to further simplification and run-away extinction cascades.},

Here, we investigate how competition strength affects population fitness in the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. Our results demonstrate that strong competition constrains adaptation of focal populations, which can be partially explained by population size reductions. However, fitness assays also reveal specific adaptation of focal populations to particular competitors varying in competitive ability. Additionally, this specific adaptation can offset the negative effects of competitor-mediated population size reductions under strong competition. Our study, therefore, highlights the importance of opposing effects of strong competition on species adaptation, which may lead to different outcomes of colonization under intense and relaxed competitive environments in the context of population dispersal.},

	abstract = {It is normal for hosts to be co-infected by parasites. Interactions among co-infecting species can have profound consequences, including changing parasite transmission dynamics, altering disease severity and confounding attempts at parasite control. Despite the importance of co-infection, there is currently no way to predict how different parasite species may interact with one another, nor the consequences of those interactions. Here, we demonstrate a method that enables such prediction by identifying two nematode parasite groups based on taxonomy and characteristics of the parasitological niche. From an understanding of the interactions between the two defined groups in one host system (wild rabbits), we predict how two different nematode species, from the same defined groups, will interact in co-infections in a different host system (sheep), and then we test this experimentally. We show that, as predicted, in co-infections, the blood-feeding nematode Haemonchus contortus suppresses aspects of the sheep immune response, thereby facilitating the establishment and/or survival of the nematode Trichostrongylus colubriformis; and that the T. colubriformis-induced immune response negatively affects H. contortus. This work is, to our knowledge, the first to use empirical data from one host system to successfully predict the specific outcome of a different co-infection in a second host species. The study therefore takes the first step in defining a practical framework for predicting interspecific parasite interactions in other animal systems.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity may lead to the emergence of simple and robust relationships between ecosystem properties. Here we show that a wide range of models of species dynamics, in the limit of high diversity, exhibit generic behavior predictable from a few emergent parameters, which control ecosystem functioning and stability. Our work points toward ways to tackle the staggering complexity of ecological systems without relying on empirically unavailable details of their structure.The study of ecological communities often involves detailed simulations of complex networks. However, our empirical knowledge of these networks is typically incomplete and the space of simulation models and parameters is vast, leaving room for uncertainty in theoretical predictions. Here we show that a large fraction of this space of possibilities exhibits generic behaviors that are robust to modeling choices. We consider a wide array of model features, including interaction types and community structures, known to generate different dynamics for a few species. We combine these features in large simulated communities, and show that equilibrium diversity, functioning, and stability can be predicted analytically using a random model parameterized by a few statistical properties of the community. We give an ecological interpretation of this “disordered” limit where structure fails to emerge from complexity. We also demonstrate that some well-studied interaction patterns remain relevant in large ecosystems, but their impact can be encapsulated in a minimal number of additional parameters. Our approach provides a powerful framework for predicting the outcomes of ecosystem assembly and quantifying the added value of more detailed models and measurements.},

	abstract = {Individual differences in behaviour characterize humans and animals alike. A hot field in behavioural ecology asks why this variation in ‘personality’ evolved. Theory posits that selection favours the integration of ‘intrinsic state’ and behaviour. Metabolism, hormones, energetic reserves and structural size have particularly been proposed as states covarying with behaviour among-individuals, either genetically or through plasticity integration. We conducted a meta-analysis estimating the amount of among-individual variation in behaviour attributable to variation in state. Our literature search showed that only 22\% of the studies claiming to estimate individual-level associations between state and behaviour actually did so. Our meta-analysis revealed that relatively aggressive, bold, explorative and/or active individuals had relatively high metabolic rates, hormone levels, body weights and/or body sizes. The proportion of among-individual variation common to state and behaviour was nevertheless small (approx. 5\%). This means that (i) adaptive explanations involving intrinsic states fail to explain much individual variation in behaviour, (ii) empiricists should consider nonlinear, additive or interactive effects of (multiple) intrinsic states, (iii) explanations not involving intrinsic states might be important, or (iv) empirical tests of state-dependent personality theory were inappropriate. Our meta-analysis highlights the importance of feedback between empiricists and theoreticians in the study of adaptive behavioural variation.},

Some appear to be universal, occurring in virtually all taxa of organisms and types of environments. They offer clues to underlying mechanisms that powerfully constrain biodiversity.

	abstract = {Dispersal is a fundamental process defining the distribution of organisms and has long been a topic of inquiry in ecology and evolution. Emerging research points to an interdependency of dispersal with a diverse suite of traits in terrestrial organisms, however the extent to which such dispersal syndromes exist in freshwater species remains uncertain. Here, we test whether dispersal in freshwater fishes (1) is a fixed property of species, and (2) correlates with life-history, morphological, ecological and behavioural traits, using a global dataset of dispersal distances collected from the literature encompassing 116 riverine species and 196 locations. Our meta-analysis revealed a high degree of repeatability and heritability in the dispersal estimates and strong associations with traits related to life-history strategies, energy allocation to reproduction, ecological specialization and swimming skills. Together, these results demonstrate that similar to terrestrial organisms, the multi-dimensional nature of dispersal syndromes in freshwater species offer opportunities for the development of a unifying paradigm of movement ecology that transcend taxonomic and biogeographical realms. The high explanatory power of the models also suggests that trait-based and phylogenetic approaches hold considerable promises to inform conservation efforts in a rapidly changing world.},

Scale-free community size spectra (i.e., size distributions regardless of species) are routinely observed in natural ecosystems and are the product of intra- and interspecies regulation of the relative abundance of organisms of different sizes. Intra- and interspecies distributions of body sizes are thus major determinants of ecosystems’ structure and function. We show experimentally that single-species mass distributions of unicellular eukaryotes covering different phyla exhibit both characteristic sizes and universal features over more than four orders of magnitude in mass. Remarkably, we find that the mean size of a species is sufficient to characterize its size distribution fully and that the latter has a universal form across all species. We show that an analytical physiological model accounts for the observed universality, which can be synthesized in a log-normal form for the intraspecies size distributions. We also propose how ecological and physiological processes should interact to produce scale-invariant community size spectra and discuss the implications of our results on allometric scaling laws involving body mass.},

	abstract = {Global biodiversity in river and riparian ecosystems is generated and maintained by geographic variation in stream processes and fluvial disturbance regimes, which largely reflect regional differences in climate and geology. Extensive construction of dams by humans has greatly dampened the seasonal and interannual streamflow variability of rivers, thereby altering natural dynamics in ecologically important flows on continental to global scales. The cumulative effects of modification to regional-scale environmental templates caused by dams is largely unexplored but of critical conservation importance. Here, we use 186 long-term streamflow records on intermediate-sized rivers across the continental United States to show that dams have homogenized the flow regimes on third- through seventh-order rivers in 16 historically distinctive hydrologic regions over the course of the 20th century. This regional homogenization occurs chiefly through modification of the magnitude and timing of ecologically critical high and low flows. For 317 undammed reference rivers, no evidence for homogenization was found, despite documented changes in regional precipitation over this period. With an estimated average density of one dam every 48 km of third- through seventh-order river channel in the United States, dams arguably have a continental scale effect of homogenizing regionally distinct environmental templates, thereby creating conditions that favor the spread of cosmopolitan, nonindigenous species at the expense of locally adapted native biota. Quantitative analyses such as ours provide the basis for conservation and management actions aimed at restoring and maintaining native biodiversity and ecosystem function and resilience for regionally distinct ecosystems at continental to global scales.},

	abstract = {Measurement of population persistence is a long-standing problem in ecology; in particular, whether it is possible to gain insights into persistence without long time-series. Fractal measurements of spatial patterns, such as the Korcak exponent or boundary dimension, have been proposed as indicators of the persistence of underlying dynamics. Here we explore under what conditions a predictive relationship between fractal measures and persistence exists. We combine theoretical arguments with an aerial snapshot and time series from a long-term study of seagrass. For this form of vegetative growth, we find that the expected relationship between the Korcak exponent and persistence is evident at survey sites where the population return rate can be measured. This highlights a limitation of the use of power-law patch-size distributions and other indicators based on spatial snapshots. Moreover, our numeric simulations show that for a single species and a range of environmental conditions that the Korcak–persistence relationship provides a link between temporal dynamics and spatial pattern; however, this relationship is specific to demographic factors, so we cannot use this methodology to compare between species.\%U http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royopensci/3/3/150519.full.pdf},

	doi = {10.1111/fwb.13037},
	abstract = {1. River networks are hierarchical dendritic habitats embedded within the terrestrial landscape, with varying connectivity between sites depending on their positions along the network. This physical organisation influences the dispersal of organisms, which ultimately affects metacommunity dynamics and biodiversity patterns.
2. We provide a conceptual synthesis of the role of river networks in structuring metacommunities in relation to dispersal processes in riverine ecosystems. We explore where the river network best explains observed metacommunity structure compared to other measurements of physical connectivity. We mostly focus on invertebrates, but also consider other taxonomic groups, including microbes, fishes, plants, and amphibians.
3. Synthesising studies that compared multiple spatial distance metrics, we found that the importance of the river network itself in explaining metacommunity patterns depended on a variety of factors, including dispersal mode (aquatic versus aerial versus terrestrial) and landscape type (arid versus mesic), as well as location- specific factors, such as network connectivity, land use, topographic heterogeneity, and biotic interactions. The river network appears to be less important for strong aerial dispersers and insects in arid systems than for other groups and biomes, but there is considerable variability. Borrowing from other literature, particularly landscape genetics, we developed a conceptual model that predicts that the explanatory power of the river network peaks in mesic systems for obligate aquatic dispersers.
4. We propose directions of future avenues of research, including the use of manipulative field and laboratory experiments that test metacommunity theory in river networks. While field and laboratory experiments have their own benefits and drawbacks (e.g. reality, control, cost), both are powerful approaches for understanding the mechanisms structuring metacommunities, by teasing apart dispersal and niche-related factors.
5. Finally, improving our knowledge of dispersal in river networks will benefit from expanding the breadth of cost-distance modelling to better infer dispersal from observational data; an improved understanding of life-history strategies rather than relying on independent traits; exploring individual-level variation in dispersal through detailed genetic studies; detailed studies on fine-scale environmental (e.g. daily hydrology) and organismal spatiotemporal variability; and synthesising comparative, experimental, and theoretical work. Expanding in these areas will help to push the current state of the science from a largely pattern-detection mode into a new phase of more mechanistically driven research.},

	doi = {10.1098/rspb.1999.0856},
	abstract = {Spatially synchronous population dynamics have been documented in many taxa. The prevailing view is that the most plausible candidates to explain this pattern are extrinsic disturbances (the Moran effect) and dispersal. In most cases disentangling these factors is difficult. Theoretical studies have shown that dispersal between subpopulations is more likely to produce a negative relationship between population synchrony and distance between the patches than perturbations. As analyses of empirical data frequently show this negative relationship between the level of synchrony and distance between populations, this has emphasized the importance of dispersal as a synchronizing agent. However, several weather patterns show spatial autocorrelation, which could potentially produce patterns in population synchrony similar to those caused by dispersal. By using spatially extended versions of several population dynamic models, we show that this is indeed the case. Our results show that, especially when both factors (spatially autocorrelated perturbations and distance–dependent dispersal) act together, there may exist groups of local populations in synchrony together but fluctuating asynchronously with some other groups of local populations. We also show, by analysing 56 long–term population data sets, that patterns of population synchrony similar to those found in our simulations are found in natural populations as well. This finding highlights the subtlety in the interactions of dispersal and noise in organizing spatial patterns in population fluctuations.\%U http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/266/1431/1851.full.pdf},

On the other hand, hypothesized productivity–diversity relationships can be positive, negative or unimodal, as confirmed by empirical studies. However, it has remained unclear under what conditions each pattern is realized, and there is little agreement about the mechanisms that generate these diverse patterns. In this study, I present a model that synthesizes these separately developed hypotheses and shows that the interactive effects of disturbance and productivity on the competitive outcome of multispecies dynamics can result in these diverse relationships of species richness to disturbance and productivity. The predicted productivity–diversity relationship is unimodal but the productivity level that maximizes species richness increases with increasing disturbance. Similarly, the predicted disturbance–diversity relationship is unimodal but the peak moves to higher disturbance levels with increasing productivity. Further, these patterns are well explained by the opposite effects of productivity and disturbance on competitive outcome that are suggested by the change in community composition along these two environmental gradients: higher productivity favours superior competitors while higher disturbance levels favour inferior competitors.\%U http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/268/1464/269.full.pdf},

	abstract = {Climate change is known to shift species' geographical ranges, phenologies and abundances, but less is known about other population dynamic consequences. Here, we analyse spatio-temporal dynamics of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) in a network of 4000 dry meadows during 21 years. The results demonstrate two strong, related patterns: the amplitude of year-to-year fluctuations in the size of the metapopulation as a whole has increased, though there is no long-term trend in average abundance; and there is a highly significant increase in the level of spatial synchrony in population dynamics. The increased synchrony cannot be explained by increasing within-year spatial correlation in precipitation, the key environmental driver of population change, or in per capita growth rate. On the other hand, the frequency of drought during a critical life-history stage (early larval instars) has increased over the years, which is sufficient to explain the increasing amplitude and the expanding spatial synchrony in metapopulation dynamics. Increased spatial synchrony has the general effect of reducing long-term metapopulation viability even if there is no change in average metapopulation size. This study demonstrates how temporal changes in weather conditions can lead to striking changes in spatio-temporal population dynamics.\%U http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/282/1806/20150173.full.pdf},

	doi = {10.1098/rspb.2009.0482},
	abstract = {Food-chain length, the number of feeding links from the basal species to the top predator, is a key characteristic of biological communities. However, the determinants of food-chain length still remain controversial. While classical theory predicts that food-chain length should increase with increasing resource availability, empirical supports of this prediction are limited to those from simple, artificial microcosms. A positive resource availability–chain length relationship has seldom been observed in natural ecosystems. Here, using a theoretical model, we show that those correlations, or no relationships, may be explained by considering the dynamic food-web reconstruction induced by predator's adaptive foraging. More specifically, with foraging adaptation, the food-chain length becomes relatively invariant, or even decreases with increasing resource availability, in contrast to a non-adaptive counterpart where chain length increases with increasing resource availability; and that maximum chain length more sharply decreases with resource availability either when species richness is higher or potential link number is larger. The interactive effects of resource availability, adaptability and community complexity may explain the contradictory effects of resource availability in simple microcosms and larger ecosystems. The model also explains the recently reported positive effect of habitat size on food-chain length as a result of increased species richness and/or decreased connectance owing to interspecific spatial segregation.\%U http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/276/1670/3113.full.pdf},

	abstract = {1. Data from Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS) transect counts were used to investigate the decline in synchrony of population fluctuations with increasing distance between sample units, and to evaluate the relative effects to local and regional scale processes on population fluctuations. 2. Each BMS transect is divided into sections and numbers (densities) of butterflies are recorded separately in each section. Local scale analyses examined population fluctuations on different sections within a single transect. Regional scale analyses examined fluctuations on different transects. 3. At the local scale population dynamics were found to be more closely synchronized between very close population units (sections) than more distant ones. There was considerable variation between data sets but on average this correlation declined relatively quickly over 1-2 km. 4. At the regional scale, where local environmental heterogeneity was averaged out (sections were lumped together within transect sites), the decline in synchrony with increasing distance (up to 200 km) was very small compared with local scale decrease, and populations remain partially synchronized throughout the range studied due to regionally correlated weather patterns. 5. Butterfly dispersal had a significant effect on synchrony at a local scale (several km): the dynamics of populations of relatively mobile species remained correlated over relatively long distances. At the regional level, however, mobility was not a significant factor, implying that widespread environmental stochasticity is of overriding importance at this scale. 6. Although mobility and distance are significant factors in determining population synchrony/asynchrony, the low r2 values attributable to them indicate that these factors are actually contributing relatively little to the overall dynamics. Butterfly species show local variation in population dynamics, nested within broad scale synchrony which is presumably generated by the climate. Heterogeneity in population dynamics, in local environments, potentially aids metapopulation persistence by buffering the effects of high levels of temporal environmental stochasticity.},

The difference between the squares of these two spatial scales of population fluctuations does not depend on the spatial scale of the noise but only on migration rate and strength of local density regulation. We also show how migration, local density regulation, and spatially correlated environmental noise affect the realized population process at a specific location. As the migration increases, the realized local density regulation and the expected population size increase, while the realized environmental noise decreases. This approach also enables us to analyze the dynamics of the total population size within quadrats of different sizes. The risk of local quasi extinction is strongly reduced by increasing quadrat size or migration rate, while an increase in environmental stochasticity or spatial correlation in the environmental noise increases the risk of quasi extinction.},

We report patterns of intraspecific spatial synchrony (cross-correlation with lag zero) in the dynamics of British moths and aphids sampled at 57 and 21 localities throughout the UK. 2. Spatial synchrony was substantially higher in aphids than in moths. In both taxa, spatial synchrony declined with increasing distance between conspecific populations, but synchrony remained positive at all distances up to 800 km. 3. Species with large slopes ({\textgreater}2) of the spatial variance-mean regression had spatially asynchronous dynamics, as predicted by a theoretical model. 4. In noctuid moths and in aphids, but not in geometrid moths, there was a significant positive correlation between the degree of spatial synchrony and the level of temporal variability in local populations. 5. We discuss the two main hypotheses about the causes of spatial synchrony, migration and regional stochasticity (spatially correlated weather conditions). We conclude that our results on large-scale spatial synchrony in moths and aphids are better explained by regional stochasticity than by migration.},

	abstract = {Black swans are improbable events that nonetheless occur—often with profound consequences. Such events drive important transitions in social systems (e.g., banking collapses) and physical systems (e.g., earthquakes), and yet it remains unclear the extent to which ecological population numbers buffer or suffer from such extremes. Here, we estimate the prevalence and direction of black-swan events (heavy-tailed process noise) in 609 animal populations after accounting for population dynamics (productivity, density dependence, and typical stochasticity). We find strong evidence for black-swan events in ∼4\% of populations. These events occur most frequently for birds (7\%), mammals (5\%), and insects (3\%) and are not explained by any life-history covariates but tend to be driven by external perturbations such as climate, severe winters, predators, parasites, or the combined effect of multiple factors. Black-swan events manifest primarily as population die-offs and crashes (86\%) rather than unexpected increases, and ignoring heavy-tailed process noise leads to an underestimate in the magnitude of population crashes. We suggest modelers consider heavy-tailed, downward-skewed probability distributions, such as the skewed Student t used here, when making forecasts of population abundance. Our results demonstrate the importance of both modeling heavy-tailed downward events in populations, and developing conservation strategies that are robust to ecological surprises.},

(2016) Nature 535:241–245]. This can cause the temporal relationships among species to change, altering the strength of interaction. A large body of work has explored what happens when coevolved species shift out of sync, but virtually no studies have documented the effects of climate-induced synchronization, which could remove temporal barriers between species and create novel interactions. We explored how a predator, the Kodiak brown bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi), responded to asymmetric phenological shifts between its primary trophic resources, sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and red elderberry (Sambucus racemosa). In years with anomalously high spring air temperatures, elderberry fruited several weeks earlier and became available during the period when salmon spawned in tributary streams. Bears departed salmon spawning streams, where they typically kill 25–75\% of the salmon [Quinn TP, Cunningham CJ, Wirsing AJ (2016) Oecologia 183:415–429], to forage on berries on adjacent hillsides. This prey switching behavior attenuated an iconic predator–prey interaction and likely altered the many ecological functions that result from bears foraging on salmon [Helfield JM, Naiman RJ (2006) Ecosystems 9:167–180]. We document how climate-induced shifts in resource phenology can alter food webs through a mechanism other than trophic mismatch. The current emphasis on singular consumer-resource interactions fails to capture how climate-altered phenologies reschedule resource availability and alter how energy flows through ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Evolution on a time scale similar to ecological dynamics has been increasingly recognized for the last three decades. Selection mediated by ecological interactions can change heritable phenotypic variation (i.e., evolution), and evolution of traits, in turn, can affect ecological interactions. Hence, ecological and evolutionary dynamics can be tightly linked and important to predict future dynamics, but our understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics is still in its infancy and there is a significant gap between theoretical predictions and empirical tests. Empirical studies have demonstrated that the presence of genetic variation can dramatically change ecological dynamics, whereas theoretical studies predict that eco-evolutionary dynamics depend on the details of the genetic variation, such as the form of a tradeoff among genotypes, which can be more important than the presence or absence of the genetic variation. Using a predator–prey (rotifer–algal) experimental system in laboratory microcosms, we studied how different forms of a tradeoff between prey defense and growth affect eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our experimental results show for the first time to our knowledge that different forms of the tradeoff produce remarkably divergent eco-evolutionary dynamics, including near fixation, near extinction, and coexistence of algal genotypes, with quantitatively different population dynamics. A mathematical model, parameterized from completely independent experiments, explains the observed dynamics. The results suggest that knowing the details of heritable trait variation and covariation within a population is essential for understanding how evolution and ecology will interact and what form of eco-evolutionary dynamics will result.},

	abstract = {Habitat configuration and temporal stochasticity in the environment are recognized as important drivers of population structure, yet few studies have examined the combined influence of these factors. We developed a spatially explicit simulation model to investigate how stochasticity in survival and reproduction influenced population dynamics on landscapes that differed in habitat configuration. Landscapes ranged from completely contiguous to highly fragmented, and simulated populations varied in mean survival probability (0.2, 0.4, 0.8) and dispersal capacity (1, 3, or 5 cells). Overall, habitat configuration had a large effect on populations, accounting for {\textgreater}80\% of the variation in population size when mean survival and dispersal capacity were held constant. Stochasticity in survival and reproduction were much less influential, accounting for {\textless}1–14\% of the variation in population size, but exacerbated the negative effects of habitat fragmentation by increasing the number of local extinctions in isolated patches. Stochasticity interacted strongly with both mean survival probability and habitat configuration. For example, survival stochasticity reduced population size when survival probability was high and habitat was fragmented, but had little effect on population size under other conditions. Reproductive stochasticity reduced population size irrespective of mean survival and habitat configuration, but had the largest effect when survival probability was intermediate and habitat was well connected. Stochasticity also enhanced the variability of population size in most cases. Contrary to expectations, increasing dispersal capacity did not increase population persistence, because the probability of finding suitable habitat within the dispersal neighborhood declined more for the same level of dispersal capacity when fragmentation was high compared to when it was low. These findings suggest that greater environmental variability, as might arise due to climate change, is likely to compound population losses due to habitat fragmentation and may directly reduce population size if reproductive output is compromised. It may also increase variability in population size.},

A hitherto unresolved question is whether the structure of the landscape inhabited by organisms leaves an imprint on their ecological networks. We analyzed, based on pyrosequencing profiling of the biofilm communities in 114 streams, how features inherent to fluvial networks affect the co-occurrence networks that the microorganisms form in these biofilms. Our findings suggest that hydrology and metacommunity dynamics, both changing predictably across fluvial networks, affect the fragmentation of the microbial co-occurrence networks throughout the fluvial network. The loss of taxa from co-occurrence networks demonstrates that the removal of gatekeepers disproportionately contributed to network fragmentation, which has potential implications for the functions biofilms fulfill in stream ecosystems. Our findings are critical because of increased anthropogenic pressures deteriorating stream ecosystem integrity and biodiversity.},

	abstract = {The effect of resource subsidies on recipient food webs has received much recent attention. The purpose of this study was to measure the effects of significant seasonal seaweed deposition events, caused by hurricanes and other storms, on species inhabiting subtropical islands. The seaweed represents a pulsed resource subsidy that is consumed by amphipods and flies, which are eaten by lizards and predatory arthropods, which in turn consume terrestrial herbivores. Additionally, seaweed decomposes directly into the soil under plants. We added seaweed to six shoreline plots and removed seaweed from six other plots for three months; all plots were repeatedly monitored for 12 months after the initial manipulation. Lizard density (Anolis sagrei) responded rapidly, and the overall average was 63\% higher in subsidized than in removal plots. Stable-isotope analysis revealed a shift in lizard diet composition toward more marine-based prey in subsidized plots. Leaf damage was 70\% higher in subsidized than in removal plots after eight months, but subsequent damage was about the same in the two treatments. Foliage growth rate was 70\% higher in subsidized plots after 12 months. Results of a complementary study on the relationship between natural variation in marine subsidies and island food web components were consistent with the experimental results. We suggest two causal pathways for the effects of marine subsidies on terrestrial plants: (1) the "fertilization effect" in which seaweed adds nutrients to plants, increasing their growth rate, and (2) the "predator diet shift effect" in which lizards shift from eating local prey (including terrestrial herbivores) to eating mostly marine detritivores.},

The potential for the swift evolution of virulence in response to changes in host ecology has motivated the integration of evolutionary ecology with epidemiological theory, as part of the emerging field of evolutionary epidemiology. Virulence is the product of complex interactions among evolutionary, ecological and epidemiological processes. Recent models that incorporate ideas from both evolutionary ecology and epidemiology generate predictions that could not be made by either discipline alone. These models predict that the ecological or evolutionary changes affecting population dynamics of disease, such as spatial structuring, within-host dynamics, polymorphism in host resistance, host longevity and population size, impose selection on virulence. As disease incidence increases, it becomes particularly important to take into account the implications of infection by multiple parasite strains. Evolutionary epidemic models also identify the potential importance of immune evasion and optimal virulence for the selection of sex in parasites. Thus, merging epidemiology with evolutionary ecology has widespread potential to help us answer evolutionary questions and to guide public health policy.},

However, the extent to which terrestrial epidemiology can be directly transferred to marine systems is uncertain. Many broad types of disease-causing organism occur both on land and in the sea, and it is clear that some emergent disease problems in marine environments are caused by pathogens moving from terrestrial to marine systems. However, marine systems are qualitatively different from terrestrial environments, and these differences affect the application of modelling and management approaches that have been developed for terrestrial systems. Phyla and body plans are more diverse in marine environments and marine organisms have different life histories and probably different disease transmission modes than many of their terrestrial counterparts. Marine populations are typically more open than terrestrial ones, with the potential for long-distance dispersal of larvae. Potentially, this might enable unusually rapid propagation of epidemics in marine systems, and there are several examples of this. Taken together, these differences will require the development of new approaches to modelling and control of infectious disease in the ocean.},

However, the impact of evolutionary dynamics on spatial patterns, such as the occurrence of classical metapopulation dynamics, is less well appreciated. Here, we analyse the evolutionary consequences of spatial network connectivity and topology for dispersal strategies and quantify the eco-evolutionary feedback in terms of altered classical metapopulation dynamics. We find that network properties, such as topology and connectivity, lead to predictable spatio-temporal correlations in fitness expectations. These spatio-temporally stable fitness patterns heavily impact evolutionarily stable dispersal strategies and lead to eco-evolutionary feedbacks on landscape level metrics, such as the number of occupied patches, the number of extinctions and recolonizations as well as metapopulation extinction risk and genetic structure. Our model predicts that classical metapopulation dynamics are more likely to occur in dendritic networks, and especially in riverine systems, compared to other types of landscape configurations. As it remains debated whether classical metapopulation dynamics are likely to occur in nature at all, our work provides an important conceptual advance for understanding the occurrence of classical metapopulation dynamics which has implications for conservation and management of spatially structured populations.},

Mussel CR were measured in aerated (or swirled for juveniles) chambers at TSS concentrations up to 15 mg L− 1 for laboratory-transformed juveniles, and up to 100 mg L− 1 for adult mussels. The CR of one-week old animals increased with TSS concentration, likely due to ontological differences in feeding (pedal vs. suspension feeding) and gill development, but CR decreased monotonically with TSS concentration in older animals (two-, three- and four-week old juveniles). The CR of adult mussels were significantly lower at TSS concentrations ≥ 8 mg L− 1, which represented a threshold in CR. Although this threshold occurred at similar concentrations across the four species, the decline in CR was largest in L. fasciola (46\% compared to no-TSS control), and smallest in V. iris (21\%). Differences among species are likely related to differences in the TSS and substrate found in their source rivers given that greater decline occurred for species in rivers with relatively lower TSS. The decrease in CR as TSS increased is consistent across marine and freshwater bivalves, at both juvenile and adult stages. The decrease in feeding was five times greater in juvenile compared to adult bivalves, which indicates how the vulnerability to environmental stressors differ across life stages. These results demonstrate that TSS reduces suspension feeding rates in freshwater unionids, therefore TSS should be managed to ensure their survival.},

	abstract = {Factors controlling phytoplankton dynamics in lotic systems remain poorly understood relative to those in standing waters, especially in smaller and mid-size streams. Here, we evaluate relationships between stream flow, suspended algal biomass, and particulate organic carbon over multiple years for a mid-size river network draining an intensively managed agricultural landscape in the Midwestern USA. As expected, we found that mid-size reaches (4th–6th order) yielded higher chlorophyll concentrations than smaller reaches (1st–3rd order); however, all reach types exhibited chlorophyll concentrations that could be considered eutrophic. Suspended algae accounted for approximately 20\% of total suspended carbon in the river network, on average. Over time, the highest levels of suspended algal biomass across all sites were associated with intermediate–high flow conditions (above median discharge but below {\textasciitilde}25\% exceedance probabilities). Lakes and wetlands were also sources of suspended algal biomass to the stream network, although substantial phytoplankton production appeared to occur in-channel apart from lentic inputs. Our findings highlight the importance of flow as a regulator of suspended algal biomass, and suggest that moderate flow events act to mobilize algae from benthic habitats or other refugia.},

	abstract = {In river systems, considerable debate exists as to why small-scale conservation with a primary focus on habitat quality brings little improvement to biological communities. To reveal potential causes of the enigmatic consequences, further explorations should focus on how species’ response to local environments is determined within a watershed. Here, we examined how immigration potential influences habitat associations of four diadromous fishes in the Shubuto River system in Hokkaido, Japan: sculpins (Cottus sp. ME and C. hangiongensis), gobies (Gymnogobius opperiens) and sea lamprey larvae (Lethenteron japonicum). We used closeness to the sea (i.e., distance from the sea) as a proxy for immigration potential, since the source of immigrants of the diadromous fishes is the river mouth. A multilevel modeling approach revealed that immigration potential had a “bottom-up effect” on local habitat–abundance relationships (current velocity and substrate coarseness), but habitat preferences did not vary along the gradient of immigration potential. This likely reflects the limited dispersal capabilities of the study species, whereby shorter travel distances may greatly enhance colonization success. Our study raises the possibility that the effectiveness of small-scale riverine conservation can be improved by selecting areas where successful colonization would be expected. Explicitly incorporating this consideration into conservation decision-making would help achieve greater success in environmental restoration and preservation actions.},

These values are shaped by the aesthetic, cultural, and recreational benefits and services provided by those landscapes. However, across the globe, processes such as urbanization, agricultural intensification, and abandonment are threatening landscape integrity, altering the personally meaningful connections people have toward specific places. Existing methods used to study landscape values, such as social surveys, are poorly suited to capture dynamic landscape-scale processes across large geographic extents. Social media data, by comparison, can be used to indirectly measure and identify valuable features of landscapes at a regional, continental, and perhaps even worldwide scale. We evaluate the usefulness of different social media platforms—Panoramio, Flickr, and Instagram—and quantify landscape values at a continental scale. We find Panoramio, Flickr, and Instagram data can be used to quantify landscape values, with features of Instagram being especially suitable due to its relatively large population of users and its functional ability of allowing users to attach personally meaningful comments and hashtags to their uploaded images. Although Panoramio, Flickr, and Instagram have different user profiles, our analysis revealed similar patterns of landscape values across Europe across the three platforms. We also found variables describing accessibility, population density, income, mountainous terrain, or proximity to water explained a significant portion of observed variation across data from the different platforms. Social media data can be used to extend our understanding of how and where individuals ascribe value to landscapes across diverse social, political, and ecological boundaries.},

Receivers of signals and cues in particular depend on perceptual strategies to adjust to noisy conditions. We found that predators that hunt using prey sounds can reduce the negative impact of noise by making use of prey cues conveyed through additional sensory systems. In the presence of masking noise, but not in its absence, frog-eating bats preferred and were faster in attacking a robotic frog emitting multiple sensory cues. The behavioral changes induced by masking noise were accompanied by an increase in active localization through echolocation. Our findings help to reveal how animals can adapt to anthropogenic noise and have implications for the role of sensory ecology in driving species interactions.\%U http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/353/6305/1277.full.pdf},

	abstract = {The planetary boundaries framework attempts to set limits for biodiversity loss within which ecological function is relatively unaffected. Newbold et al. present a quantitative global analysis of the extent to which the proposed planetary boundary has been crossed (see the Perspective by Oliver). Using over 2 million records for nearly 40,000 terrestrial species, they modeled the response of biodiversity to land use and related pressures and then estimated, at a spatial resolution of ∼1 km2, the extent and spatial patterns of changes in local biodiversity. Across 65\% of the terrestrial surface, land use and related pressures have caused biotic intactness to decline beyond 10\%, the proposed “safe” planetary boundary. Changes have been most pronounced in grassland biomes and biodiversity hotspots.Science, this issue p. 288; see also p. 220Land use and related pressures have reduced local terrestrial biodiversity, but it is unclear how the magnitude of change relates to the recently proposed planetary boundary (“safe limit”). We estimate that land use and related pressures have already reduced local biodiversity intactness—the average proportion of natural biodiversity remaining in local ecosystems—beyond its recently proposed planetary boundary across 58.1\% of the world’s land surface, where 71.4\% of the human population live. Biodiversity intactness within most biomes (especially grassland biomes), most biodiversity hotspots, and even some wilderness areas is inferred to be beyond the boundary. Such widespread transgression of safe limits suggests that biodiversity loss, if unchecked, will undermine efforts toward long-term sustainable development.\%U http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/353/6296/288.full.pdf},

We present a method for assessing the impacts from infrastructure on wildlife, based on functional response curves describing density reductions in birds and mammals (e.g., road-effect zones), and apply it to Spain as a case study. The imprint of infrastructure extends over most of the country (55.5\% in the case of birds and 97.9\% for mammals), with moderate declines predicted for birds (22.6\% of individuals) and severe declines predicted for mammals (46.6\%). Despite certain limitations, we suggest the approach proposed is widely applicable to the evaluation of effects of planned infrastructure developments under multiple scenarios, and propose an internationally coordinated strategy to update and improve it in the future.},

	abstract = {Trophically transmitted parasites often alter their intermediate host's phenotype, thereby predisposing hosts to increased predation. This is generally considered to be a parasite strategy evolved to enhance transmission to the next host. However, the adaptive value of host manipulation is not clear, as it may be associated with costs, such as increased susceptibility to predator species that are unsuitable next hosts for the parasites. Thus, it has been proposed that, to be adaptive, manipulation should be specific by predisposing hosts more strongly to predation by target hosts (next host in the life cycle) than to non-hosts. Here we formally evaluate this prediction, and show that manipulation does not have to be specific to be adaptive. However, when manipulation is nonspecific, it needs to effectively increase the overall predation risk of infected hosts if it is to increase the parasite transmission probability. Thus, when initial predation risk is low, even highly nonspecific manipulation strategies can be adaptive. However, when initial predation risk is high, manipulation needs to be more specific to increase parasite transmission success. Therefore, nonspecific host manipulation may evolve in nature, but the adaptive value of a certain manipulation strategy can vary among different parasite populations depending on the variation in initial predation risk.\%U http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiolett/4/6/663.full.pdf},

However, the adaptive value of host manipulation is not clear as it may be associated with costs, such as increased susceptibility to predators that are unsuitable next hosts for the parasites. We examined the ratio between the benefits and costs of host manipulation for transmission success of Acanthocephalus lucii (Acanthocephala), a parasite that alters the hiding behaviour and pigmentation of its isopod hosts. We experimentally compared the susceptibility of infected and uninfected isopods to predation by perch (Perca fluvialis; definitive host of the parasite) and dragonfly larvae (dead end). We found that the parasite predisposed the isopods to predation by both predators. However, the increased predation vulnerability of the infected isopods was higher towards perch. This suggests that, despite the costs due to non-host predation, host manipulation may still be advantageous for the parasite.\%U http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/275/1643/1611.full.pdf},

Long-term field survey undertaken in 2006–2012 revealed that eight populations survived and at least 22 became extinct. The total number of mussels found was about 50,000, with the largest population in one small river consisting of approximately 40,000 individuals. Juveniles were found in six populations. The data obtained are of interest for assessing the resilience and stability of pearl mussel populations in response to potentially negative environmental and particularly anthropogenic impacts. The results are expected to inform future management strategies for conservation of suitable habitats for successful pearl mussel reproduction.

	abstract = {SUMMARYParasite-induced modifications of host behaviour are known from a wide range of host-parasite associations. In many cases, these behavioural changes are thought to be adaptive and. benefit the parasite by increasing its probability of successful transmission. However, in many cases, energy spent on host manipulation will not be available for other functions, such as growth. These trade-offs suggest that in the absence of other constraints, natural selection will optimize, and not maximize, the influence of parasites on host behaviour. This argument is developed and expanded into theoretical considerations of the evolution of host behaviour manipulation by parasites. Among populations of the same parasite species or among closely-related species, the optimal investment into manipulation, or optimal manipulative effort (ME*), of individual parasites is predicted to increase as (1) typical infrapopulation size decreases, (2) prevalence increases, (3) the longevity of the infected host, or of the parasite in its host, decreases, (4) passive transmission rates decrease, and (5) parasite fecundity decreases. This evolutionary analysis indicates that ecological and life history variables may have played an important role in the evolution of manipulation of host behaviour by parasites.},

To illustrate this framework, hierarchical models are developed using the Poisson and negative-binomial distributions to model variation in abundance among subpopulations and using the beta distribution to model variation in capture probabilities. These models are fitted to the removal counts observed in a survey of a federally endangered fish species. The resulting estimates of abundance have similar or better precision than those computed using the conventional approach of analyzing the removal counts of each subpopulation separately. Extension of the hierarchical models to include spatial covariates of abundance is straightforward and may be used to identify important features of an animal's habitat or to predict the abundance of animals at unsampled locations.},

Lungworms (Rhabdias pseudosphaerocephala) of cane toads (Rhinella marina) were introduced to Australia from the toad’s native range, along with the toads, and have been suggested as a potential biocontrol of invasive toads due to various negative impacts on toad viability. We conducted two radio-telemetry studies on a tropical floodplain to specifically assess the parasite’s impact on toad dispersal. First, a retrospective correlative analysis of data from field-collected animals showed that toads infected with lungworms moved farther, not less, than uninfected conspecifics. Second, an experimental study (comparing movements of experimentally infected toads vs. uninfected controls) showed that lungworms did not modify rates of toad dispersal. In addition, experimental infection with lungworms did not elicit an immune response substantial enough to influence dispersal behaviour. Thus, we conclude that increasing lungworm densities at the invasion front as an attempt at biocontrol would not slow down the spread of cane toads.},

An increasing number of studies indicate that host genetic diversity plays an important role in buffering populations against widespread epidemics, and that parasites represent powerful selective agents in natural populations. The observation that infectious diseases might be both mitigated by and rapidly change the genetic composition of host populations gives new significance to the role of host genetic diversity in species conservation. Less clear is the role that pathogen evolutionary change plays in the emergence and spread of new diseases, but recent examples indicate that humans might be selecting unknowingly for rapid changes in pathogen biology through habitat fragmentation, climate shifts and environmental pollution. Although the risks they pose to endangered species are apparent, pathogens and other natural enemies can be a driving force behind species and genetic diversity in natural populations, and preserving interacting networks of coevolving populations should enable hosts to respond better to future disease threats.},

Our analysis highlights the crucial importance of ecological spatial dynamics in evolutionary processes and reveals the theoretical possibility that parasites could manipulate their hosts' dispersal.\%U http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/273/1590/1063.full.pdf},

We used time-series data from individual hosts in natural populations to analyze patterns of infection risk for a microparasite community, detecting large positive and negative effects of other infections. Patterns remain once variations in host susceptibility and exposure are accounted for. Indeed, effects are typically of greater magnitude, and explain more variation in infection risk, than the effects associated with host and environmental factors more commonly considered in disease studies.

The association of fish farms with disease emergence in sympatric wild fish stocks remains one of the most controversial and unresolved threats aquaculture poses to coastal ecosystems and fisheries. We report a comprehensive analysis of the spread and impact of farm-origin parasites on the survival of wild fish populations. We mathematically coupled extensive data sets of native parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) transmission and pathogenicity on migratory wild juvenile pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (Oncorhynchus keta) salmon. Farm-origin lice induced 9–95\% mortality in several sympatric wild juvenile pink and chum salmon populations. The epizootics arise through a mechanism that is new to our understanding of emerging infectious diseases: fish farms undermine a functional role of host migration in protecting juvenile hosts from parasites associated with adult hosts. Although the migratory life cycles of Pacific salmon naturally separate adults from juveniles, fish farms provide L. salmonis novel access to juvenile hosts, in this case raising infection rates for at least the first ≈2.5 months of the salmon's marine life (≈80 km of the migration route). Spatial segregation between juveniles and adults is common among temperate marine fishes, and as aquaculture continues its rapid growth, this disease mechanism may challenge the sustainability of coastal ecosystems and economies.},

	abstract = {Marine salmon farming has been correlated with parasitic sea lice infestations and concurrent declines of wild salmonids. Here, we report a quantitative analysis of how a single salmon farm altered the natural transmission dynamics of sea lice to juvenile Pacific salmon. We studied infections of sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus clemensi ) on juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) as they passed an isolated salmon farm during their seaward migration down two long and narrow corridors. Our calculations suggest the infection pressure imposed by the farm was four orders of magnitude greater than ambient levels, resulting in a maximum infection pressure near the farm that was 73 times greater than ambient levels and exceeded ambient levels for 30 km along the two wild salmon migration corridors. The farm-produced cohort of lice parasitizing the wild juvenile hosts reached reproductive maturity and produced a second generation of lice that re-infected the juvenile salmon. This raises the infection pressure from the farm by an additional order of magnitude, with a composite infection pressure that exceeds ambient levels for 75 km of the two migration routes. Amplified sea lice infestations due to salmon farms are a potential limiting factor to wild salmonid conservation.\%U http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/272/1564/689.full.pdf},

Although the salmon at site A (which had 5.1 times fewer freshwater mussels than site B) were significantly larger than the salmon at site B, there was no correlation between size of salmon and abundance of glochidia. Mean condition factor (K) was lower at site B. There was a significant increase in K in spring, which was most likely due to spring growth as there was no significant decrease in glochidia abundance. Significant, negative regressions were found only in January and February, when 24 and 66\% of the variation in K, respectively, could be explained by the abundance of glochidia on the gills. Abundance and prevalence of infection did not change significantly between October and March. There was, however, a 45\% decrease in infections of over 300 glochidia after December, which may have been due to host mortality. The mean size of glochidia increased between October and November, levelled off between December and March, and increased again in April. In May there was no further increase in growth, which is believed to be due to the loss of larger glochidia from the gills at that time. The data suggest an increasingly detrimental impact to juvenile salmon over winter as a function of the time and degree of infection (i.e., intensity, abundance) with mussel glochidia.},

	doi = {10.1098/rspb.2014.1734},
	abstract = {Long-distance animal migrations have important consequences for infectious disease dynamics. In some cases, migration lowers pathogen transmission by removing infected individuals during strenuous journeys and allowing animals to periodically escape contaminated habitats. Human activities are now causing some migratory animals to travel shorter distances or form sedentary (non-migratory) populations. We focused on North American monarch butterflies and a specialist protozoan parasite to investigate how the loss of migratory behaviours affects pathogen spread and evolution. Each autumn, monarchs migrate from breeding grounds in the eastern US and Canada to wintering sites in central Mexico. However, some monarchs have become non-migratory and breed year-round on exotic milkweed in the southern US. We used field sampling, citizen science data and experimental inoculations to quantify infection prevalence and parasite virulence among migratory and sedentary populations. Infection prevalence was markedly higher among sedentary monarchs compared with migratory monarchs, indicating that diminished migration increases infection risk. Virulence differed among parasite strains but was similar between migratory and sedentary populations, potentially owing to high gene flow or insufficient time for evolutionary divergence. More broadly, our findings suggest that human activities that alter animal migrations can influence pathogen dynamics, with implications for wildlife conservation and future disease risks.\%U http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/282/1801/20141734.full.pdf},

	abstract = {There is accumulating evidence that individuals leave their natal area and select a breeding habitat non-randomly by relying upon information about their natal and future breeding environments. This variation in dispersal is not only based on external information (condition dependence) but also depends upon the internal state of individuals (phenotype dependence). As a consequence, not all dispersers are of the same quality or search for the same habitats. In addition, the individual's state is characterized by morphological, physiological or behavioural attributes that might themselves serve as a cue altering the habitat choice of conspecifics. These combined effects of internal and external information have the potential to generate complex movement patterns and could influence population dynamics and colonization processes. Here, we highlight three particular processes that link condition-dependent dispersal, phenotype-dependent dispersal and habitat choice strategies: (1) the relationship between the cause of departure and the dispersers' phenotype; (2) the relationship between the cause of departure and the settlement behaviour and (3) the concept of informed dispersal, where individuals gather and transfer information before and during their movements through the landscape. We review the empirical evidence for these processes with a special emphasis on vertebrate and arthropod model systems, and present case studies that have quantified the impacts of these processes on spatially structured population dynamics. We also discuss recent literature providing strong evidence that individual variation in dispersal has an important impact on both reinforcement and colonization success and therefore must be taken into account when predicting ecological responses to global warming and habitat fragmentation.},

	abstract = {Body condition-dependent dispersal strategies are common in nature. Although it is obvious that environmental constraints may induce a positive relationship between body condition and dispersal, it is not clear whether positive body conditional dispersal strategies may evolve as a strategy in metapopulations. We have developed an individual-based simulation model to investigate how body condition-dispersal reaction norms evolve in metapopulations that are characterized by different levels of environmental stochasticity and dispersal mortality. In the model, body condition is related to fecundity and determined either by environmental conditions during juvenile development (adult dispersal) or by those experienced by the mother (natal dispersal). Evolutionarily stable reaction norms strongly depend on metapopulation conditions: positive body condition dependency of dispersal evolved in metapopulation conditions with low levels of dispersal mortality and high levels of environmental stochasticity. Negative body condition-dependent dispersal evolved in metapopulations with high dispersal mortality and low environmental stochasticity. The latter strategy is responsible for higher dispersal rates under kin competition when dispersal decisions are based on body condition reached at the adult life stage. The evolution of both positive and negative body condition-dependent dispersal strategies is consequently likely in metapopulations and depends on the prevalent environmental conditions.},

Host populations with higher densities showed lower dispersal, possibly owing to social aggregation behaviour.

Parasite-induced modification of dispersal may have consequences for the spatial distribution of disease, host and parasite genetic population structure, and coevolution.},

The model includes error terms for isotope ratios, diet proportions, and fractionation. The model accurately predicted temporal delta(15)N dynamics of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in a diet-switch experiment but was less successful for delta(13)C, possibly because of variable fractionation. The model was then used in three heuristic applications. In a diet-validation scenario, a model derived from limited knowledge of rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) diet reasonably estimated delta(13)C and delta(15)N compared with a null model but inaccurately estimated prey consumption. In a scenario where adult lake trout briefly cannibalized stocked lake trout fingerlings, the detectability of a cannibalism-induced delta(15)N increase depended on predator size, duration of cannibalism, and sample size. In a scenario where seasonal isotopic variability occurred at the base of a food web, variation propagated to higher trophic levels depended on consumer size and diet. Our approach is most valuable when used to examine multiple diet combinations that produce observed stable isotope ratios; one can then identify the most reasonable diets through field tests or other observations.},

The viral diseases Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis (IPN), Pancreatic Disease (PD), Infectious Haemorrhagic Necrosis (IHN), Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (VHS), and Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA) cause massive economic losses to the global salmonid aquaculture industry every year. To date, no solution exists to treat livestock affected by a viral disease and only a small number of efficient vaccines are available to prevent infection. As a consequence, understanding the host immune response against viruses in these fish species is critical to develop prophylactic and preventive control measures. The innate immune response represents an important part of the host defence mechanism preventing viral replication after infection. It is a fast acting response designed to inhibit virus propagation immediately within the host, allowing for the adaptive specific immunity to develop. It has cellular and humoral components which act in synergy. This review will cover inflammation responses, the cell types involved, apoptosis, antimicrobial peptides. Particular attention will be given to the type I interferon system as the major player in the innate antiviral defence mechanism of salmonids. Viral evasion strategies will also be discussed.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1522931113},
	abstract = {Birds are prolific colonists of islands, where they readily evolve distinct forms. Identifying predictable, directional patterns of evolutionary change in island birds, however, has proved challenging. The “island rule” predicts that island species evolve toward intermediate sizes, but its general applicability to birds is questionable. However, convergent evolution has clearly occurred in the island bird lineages that have undergone transitions to secondary flightlessness, a process involving drastic reduction of the flight muscles and enlargement of the hindlimbs. Here, we investigated whether volant island bird populations tend to change shape in a way that converges subtly on the flightless form. We found that island bird species have evolved smaller flight muscles than their continental relatives. Furthermore, in 366 populations of Caribbean and Pacific birds, smaller flight muscles and longer legs evolved in response to increasing insularity and, strikingly, the scarcity of avian and mammalian predators. On smaller islands with fewer predators, birds exhibited shifts in investment from forelimbs to hindlimbs that were qualitatively similar to anatomical rearrangements observed in flightless birds. These findings suggest that island bird populations tend to evolve on a trajectory toward flightlessness, even if most remain volant. This pattern was consistent across nine families and four orders that vary in lifestyle, foraging behavior, flight style, and body size. These predictable shifts in avian morphology may reduce the physical capacity for escape via flight and diminish the potential for small-island taxa to diversify via dispersal.},

Organic detritus made up most of the diet ash-free-dry-mass (AFDM) throughout the year, averaging 97.79\%, with algae (2.12\%) and bacteria (0.09\%) making up the remainder of the diet AFDM. Assimilation efficiency for AFDM averaged 72\% during warmer months and 53\% during cooler months (annual mean = 61\%). Gut fullness (amount of AFDM in the anterior one-tenth of the intestine) was low (mean = 0.10 mg diet AFDM . g(-1) ammocoete). There were no significant differences in these measures between ammocoetes collected from the Upper Peninsula and those collected throughout the Great Lakes basin. From a laboratory-determined relationship between gut fullness and feeding rate, feeding rate in the field was estimated to be extremely slow, ranging from 4.2 to 5.5 mg diet AFDM . g(-1) ammocoete . d(-1). These observations indicate that larval lampreys efficiently utilize a diet of organic detritus during warmer months when stream temperatures and food quality are more favorable for feeding, digestion, and growth.},

	abstract = {1. Water flow is a critical driver of aquatic ecosystem health and function. Amid rising concerns over changing flow regimes, there is an urgent need to understand the functional mechanisms by which flow influences patterns of freshwater biodiversity. 2. We explored the functional link between flow velocity and microhabitat specialisation in a speciose group of freshwater gobies (comprising over half the total fish species richness) within insular streams of the Australian Wet Tropics under base flow conditions. We addressed two particular questions: (i) What is the relative selectivity of species towards streambed composition and water flow velocity? and (ii) Can patterns of microhabitat occupation be explained by differences in intrinsic flow performance among species? To answer these questions, we combined visual field observations of microhabitat use with flow tank assessments of flow speed performance. 3. Tropical freshwater gobies displayed strong specificity towards flow velocities, while being relatively non-selective towards streambed composition. At opposite extremes of the spectrum, we found Sicyopterus lagocephalus occupying high-flow ({\textgreater}1.0ms1) microhabitats while Redigobius bikolanus selected slower-flow ({\textless}0.05ms1) areas. These patterns of microhabitat flow specificity were largely explained by the different abilities of species to swim and/or cling to the substratum under these different flow settings. 4. Our findings confirm suggestions that predictable base flows in tropical streams support habitat specialists, which include one species capable of occupying areas of extremely high flow that very few other fishes can withstand. 5. The functional link between flow and gobioid fish distribution patterns could occur throughout tropical streams of the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean as a widespread phenomenon that may help inform stream flow management guidelines to maintain this substantial component of tropical freshwater biodiversity around the globe.},

DA (dark type), were examined in relation to their predation effects on local prey density in a small coastal stream in southwestern Shikoku, Japan. Correlations among the foraging range, frequency of foraging attempts and current velocity indicated that individuals using fast-current habitats had small foraging ranges and infrequently made foraging attempts while those in slow currents frequently foraged over large areas. The former and the latter were recognized as ambush and wandering foragers, respectively. Interspecific comparisons of habitat use, foraging behavior and prey preference suggested that Rhinogobius sp. CO selectively forage mobile prey by ambushing in fast currents, whereas Rhinogobius sp. DA randomly forage available prey by wandering in slow-current habitats. A cage experiment was conducted to assess prey immigration rate and the degree of predation effects on local prey density in relation to current velocity. The results of the experiment support, at least in part, our initial predictions: (1) prey immigration rates increase with current velocity and (2) the effects of fish predation on local prey density are reduced as current velocity increases. Overall results illustrated a link between the foraging modes of the stream gobies and their predation effects on local prey density: fish adopt ambush foraging},

Anadromous alewife (seasonal migrants) exhibit larger gapes, gill-raker spacing and target larger prey than landlocked alewife (year-round freshwater resident). In ‘anadromous’ lakes, Daphnia are abundant in the spring but extirpated by alewife predation in summer. Daphnia are rare year-round in ‘landlocked’ lakes. We show that Daphnia from lakes with anadromous alewife grew faster, matured earlier but at the same size and produced more offspring than Daphnia from lakes with landlocked or no alewife across multiple temperature and resource treatments. Our results are inconsistent with a response to size-selective predation but are better explained as an adaptation to colder temperatures and shorter periods of development (countergradient variation) mediated by seasonal alewife predation.},

	abstract = {Elevational gradients of biodiversity have been widely investigated, and yet a clear interpretation of the biotic and abiotic factors that determine how species richness varies with elevation is still elusive. In mountainous landscapes, habitats at different elevations are characterized by different areal extent and connectivity properties, key drivers of biodiversity, as predicted by metacommunity theory. However, most previous studies directly correlated species richness to elevational gradients of potential drivers, thus neglecting the interplay between such gradients and the environmental matrix. Here, we investigate the role of geomorphology in shaping patterns of species richness. We develop a spatially explicit zero-sum metacommunity model where species have an elevation-dependent fitness and otherwise neutral traits. Results show that ecological dynamics over complex terrains lead to the null expectation of a hump-shaped elevational gradient of species richness, a pattern widely observed empirically. Local species richness is found to be related to the landscape elevational connectivity, as quantified by a newly proposed metric that applies tools of complex network theory to measure the closeness of a site to others with similar habitat. Our theoretical results suggest clear geomorphic controls on elevational gradients of species richness and support the use of the landscape elevational connectivity as a null model for the analysis of the distribution of biodiversity.},

Metamorphosis from larvae to adult can cause large chemical changes in insects, altering contaminant concentrations and fractionation of chemical tracers used to establish contaminant biomagnification in food webs, but no framework exists for predicting and managing these effects. We analyzed data from 39 studies of 68 analytes (stable isotopes and contaminants), and found that metamorphosis effects varied greatly. delta(15)N, widely used to estimate relative trophic position in biomagnification studies, was enriched by approximately 1 per thousand during metamorphosis, while delta(13)C used to estimate diet, was similar in larvae and adults. Metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were predominantly lost during metamorphosis leading to approximately 2 to 125-fold higher larval concentrations and higher exposure risks for predators of larvae compared to predators of adults. In contrast, manufactured organic contaminants (such as polychlorinated biphenyls) were retained and concentrated in adults, causing up to approximately 3-fold higher adult concentrations and higher exposure risks to predators of adult insects. Both food web studies and contaminant management and mitigation strategies need to consider how metamorphosis affects the movement of materials between habitats and ecosystems, with special regard for aquatic-terrestrial linkages.},

Rapid adaptation can result from either rapid evolution or phenotypic plasticity, but their effects on population dynamics are seldom compared directly. Here we examine theoretically the effects of rapid evolution and phenotypic plasticity of antipredatory defense on predator-prey dynamics. Our analyses reveal that phenotypic plasticity tends to stabilize population dynamics more strongly than rapid evolution. It is therefore important to know the mechanism by which phenotypic variation is generated for predicting the dynamics of rapidly adapting populations. We next examine an advantage of a phenotypically plastic prey genotype over the polymorphism of specialist prey genotypes. Numerical analyses reveal that the plastic genotype, if there is a small cost for maintaining it, cannot coexist with the pairs of specialist counterparts unless the system has a limit cycle. Furthermore, for the plastic genotype to replace specialist genotypes, a forced environmental fluctuation is critical in a broad parameter range. When these results are combined, the plastic genotype enjoys an advantage with population oscillations, but plasticity tends to lose its advantage by stabilizing the oscillations. This dilemma leads to an interesting intermittent limit cycle with the changing frequency of phenotypic plasticity.},

	abstract = {We present a synthesis of empirical and theoretical work investigating how parasites influence competitive and predatory interactions between other species. We examine the direct and indirect effects of parasitism and discuss examples of density and parasite-induced trait-mediated effects. Recent work reveals previously unrecognized complexity in parasite-mediated interactions. In addition to parasite-modified and apparent competition leading to species exclusion or enabling coexistence, parasites and predators interact in different ways to regulate or destablize the population dynamics of their joint prey. An emerging area is the impact of parasites on intraguild predation (IGP). Parasites can increase vulnerability of infected individuals to cannibalism or predation resulting in reversed species dominance in IGP hierarchies. We discuss the potential significance of parasites for community structure and biodiversity, in particular their role in promoting species exclusion or coexistence and the impact of emerging diseases. Ongoing invasions provide examples where parasites mediate native/invader interactions and play a key role in determining the outcome of invasions. We highlight the need for more quantitative data to assess the impact of parasites on communities, and the combination of theoretical and empirical studies to examine how the effects of parasitism scale up to community-level processes.},

	abstract = {Disturbance frequency, intensity, and areal extent may influence the effects of disturbance on biological communities. Furthermore, these three factors may have interacting effects on biological diversity. We manipulated the frequency, intensity, and area of disturbance in a full-factorial design on artificial substrates and measured responses of benthic macroinvertebrates in a northern Vermont stream. Macroinvertebrate abundance was lower in all disturbance treatments than in the undisturbed control. As in most other studies in streams, species density (number of species/sample) was lower in disturbed treatments than in undisturbed controls. However, species density is very sensitive to total abundance of a sample, which is usually reduced by disturbance. We used a rarefaction method to compare species richness based on an equivalent number of individuals. In rarefied samples, species richness was higher in all eight disturbed treatments than in the undisturbed control, with significant increases in species richness for larger areas and greater intensities of disturbance. Increases in species richness in response to disturbance were consistent within patches, among patches with similar disturbance histories, and among patches with differing disturbance histories. These results provide some support for Huston's dynamic-equilibrium model but do not support the intermediate-disturbance hypothesis. Our analyses demonstrate that species richness and species density can generate opposite patterns of community response to disturbance. The interplay of abundance, species richness, and species density has been neglected in previous tests of disturbance models.},

	abstract = {The quality and amount of productivity plays a central role in determining community structure and biogeochemical dynamics in ecosystems. Humans have altered river ecosystems in multiple ways that are likely to influence annual rates of ecosystem productivity and metabolism, but the net affects of such modifications on these processes are poorly known, especially at annual scales. An analysis of annual, whole ecosystem productivity for over 200 streams and rivers shows that human activities shift the amount, quality, and spatial distribution of production in river networks via enrichment of resources that limit autotrophic production. Human actions increased primary production to a greater degree than heterotrophic respiration, shifting streams (i.e., sites {\textless}100 km(2) watershed area) toward greater autochthony. Whereas human activities change multiple aspects of environmental conditions in streams, and often result in habitat degradation, reduction in biodiversity, and elevated contaminants, these analyses show that primary and secondary productivity of strongly impacted streams increased by over 600\% relative to reference (pristine/lightly modified) sites due to increased resource availability and quality. A human-driven increase in autotrophic-based production is thus likely a major factor in ongoing global shifts in biodiversity, trophic dynamics and element cycling in streams.},

This same process is considered profoundly important, also, for facilitating restoration of freshwater fish faunas after perturbation. This is demonstrated for a diversity of New Zealand situations, including maintenance of fish faunas in streams on small islands that may frequently become dry, recent volcanism in the central North Island, and Pleistocene glaciation on the west coast of the South Island. Similarly, diadromy has a probable role in the restoration of fish faunas following retreat of glaciers in Alaska from Pleistocene to modem times. The postglacial biogeography of freshwater fishes along boreal Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America is reinterpreted in the context of faunas containing a high proportion of diadromous species. Although migratory fish in the Great Lakes are not strictly diadromous, their patterns of movement closely resemble diadromy, and the principles governing the restoration of migratory fish communities in the Great Lakes may be similar to those that apply to restoration along oceanic coastlines where the importance of diadromy seems obvious.},

	abstract = {Use of stable isotope ratios to trace pathways of organic matter among consumers requires knowledge of the isotopic shift between diet and consumer. Variation in trophic shift among consumers can be substantial. For data from the published literature and supplementary original data (excluding fluid-feeding consumers), the mean isotopic shift for C was + 0.5 +/- 0.13parts per thousand rather than 0.0parts per thousand, as commonly assumed. The shift for C was higher for consumers analyzed as muscle (+ 1.3 +/- 0.30parts per thousand) than for consumers analyzed whole (+ 0.3 +/- 0.14parts per thousand). Among consumers analyzed whole, the trophic shift for C was lower for consumers acidified prior to analysis (- 0.2 +/- 0.21parts per thousand) than for unacidified samples (+ 0.5 +/- 0.17parts per thousand). For N, trophic shift was lower for consumers raised on invertebrate diets (+ 1.4 +/- 0.21parts per thousand) than for consumers raised on other high-protein diets (+ 3.3 +/- 0.26parts per thousand) and was intermediate for consumers raised on plant and algal diets (+ 2.2 +/- 0.30parts per thousand). The trophic shift for S differed between high-protein (+ 2.0 +/- 0.65parts per thousand) and low-protein diets (45 +/- 0.56parts per thousand). Thus, methods of analysis and dietary differences can affect trophic shift for consumers; the utility of stable isotope methods can be improved if this information is incorporated into studies of trophic relationships. Although few studies of stable isotope ratios have considered variation in the trophic shift, such variation is important because small errors in estimates of trophic shift can result in large errors in estimates of the contribution of sources to consumers or in estimates of trophic position.},

	abstract = {Stable isotope mixing models are often used to quantify source contributions to a mixture. Examples include pollution source identification; trophic web studies; analysis of water sources for soils, plants; or water bodies, and many others. A common problem is having too many sources to allow a unique solution. We discuss two alternative procedures for addressing this problem. One option is a priori to combine sources with similar signatures so the number of sources is small enough to provide a unique solution. Aggregation should be considered only when isotopic signatures of clustered sources are not significantly different, and sources are related so the combined source group has some functional significance. For example, in a food web analysis, lumping several species within a trophic guild allows more interpretable results than lumping disparate food sources, even if they have similar isotopic signatures. One result of combining mixing model sources is increased uncertainty of the combined end-member isotopic signatures and consequently the source contribution estimates; this effect can be quantified using the IsoError model (http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/models/isotopes/isoerror1\_04.htm). As an alternative to lumping sources before a mixing analysis, the IsoSource mixing model (http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/models/isosource/isosource.htm) can be used to find all feasible solutions of source contributions consistent with isotopic mass balance. While ranges of feasible contributions for each individual source can often be quite broad, contributions from functionally related groups of sources can be summed a posteriori, producing a range of solutions for the aggregate source that may be considerably narrower. A paleo-human dietary analysis example illustrates this method, which involves a terrestrial meat food source, a combination of three terrestrial plant foods, and a combination of three marine foods. In this case, a posteriori aggregation of sources allowed strong conclusions about temporal shifts in marine versus terrestrial diets that would not have otherwise been discerned.},

	abstract = {Connectivity is a fundamental concept that is widely utilized in spatial ecology. The majority of connectivity measures used in the recent ecological literature only consider the nearest neighbor patch/population, or patches within a limited neighborhood of the focal patch (a buffer). Meta-analysis suggests that studies using nearest neighbor connectivity measures are much less likely to find statistically significant effects of connectivity than studies that use more complex measures. Here we compare simple connectivity measures in their ability to predict colonization events in two large and good-quality empirical data sets. The nearest neighbor distance to an occupied patch is found to be an inferior measure. Buffer measures do much better, but their performance is found to be sensitive to the estimate of the buffer radius. For highly fragmented habitats, the best and most consistent performance is found for a measure that takes into account the size of the focal patch and the sizes of and distances to all potential source populations. When experimenting with reduced data sets, it was discovered that nearest neighbor measures fail to find a statistically significant effect of connectivity for a large range of data set sizes for which the more complex measures still detect a highly significant effect. We conclude that the simplicity of a nearest neighbor measure is not an adequate compensation for poor performance.},

This fundamental ecosystem attribute has long been recognized but the influence of this property on community regulation has not been investigated. We propose that this environmental attribute may explain variation in the strength of trophic cascades among ecosystems. Simply because of gravity, we should predict that systems with convex profiles receive low amounts of subsidies whereas systems with concave profiles act as spatial attractors, and receive high amounts of subsidies. The subsidy hypothesis states that ecosystems with high amounts of allochthonous inputs will experience the strongest trophic cascades. To test this hypothesis, we derive ecosystem models and investigate the effect of location and magnitude of subsidies on the strength of trophic cascades. Predictions from our models support the subsidy hypothesis and highlight the need to consider ecosystems as open to allochthonous flows.},

	abstract = {The food and feeding habits of riparian ground beetles were studied in four alpine floodplains (Bavaria, Germany): a 5th-order stream (the Isar) and three 3rd-order streams. The riparian fauna along the streams mainly consists of predaceous species. Riparian ground beetle densities were much higher along the Tsar than along the small streams. Aquatic invertebrates composed 89\% of the potential prey for carnivorous terrestrial insects along the Isar. Besides aquatic organisms washed ashore, stoneflies emerging on land are of considerable importance as potential prey for terrestrial predators. In contrast, only 34\% of the potential prey organisms collected along the small streams were of aquatic origin. Food abundance was 9 times higher in the shore region of the Isar compared to the small streams. Surface drift in the Isar, a potentially important food source for riparian organisms, was about 10(6) organisms and exuviae per meter stream width in 24 h. The drift density in the Isar was 59 times higher than that in a small stream. Terrestrial organisms provided only 3\% of the drifting particles in the Isar, but 50\% in the small stream. Gut content analysis reveals, that riparian ground beetles in the Isar floodplain mainly feed on aquatic organisms washed ashore or emerging on land. While small Bembidion species prefer chironomids (larvae and adults) the larger species Nebria picicornis feeds on emerging stoneflies, terrestrial riparian organisms and aquatic organisms accumulating along the shoreline. The prey of riparian ground beetles in the floodplain of the three small streams mainly consists of terrestrial species some of which may have been washed ashore.},

	abstract = {Stocking with hatchery fish is the principal method for harvest augmentation and, recently, restoring endangered populations. However, there is increasing concern about the negative effects of competition between hatchery and wild fish. In this study, enclosure experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of hatchery chum salmon fry (Oncorhynchus keta) on wild masu (Oncorhynchus masou) and chum salmon fry through density-dependent competition. For masu and chum salmon, density-dependent performance (foraging rate and growth) varied depending on the presence or absence of competitor species. The negative effects on the foraging rate (evaluated by stomach content mass) and growth of wild masu salmon caused by wild conspecifics were greater than those exerted by wild and hatchery chum salmon. Wild chum salmon decreased foraging rate with increasing density of conspecifics and masu salmon and also in the presence of hatchery chum salmon. Although we could not evaluate growth under interspecific competition, wild chum salmon show body mass loss in the presence of hatchery chum salmon. These results suggest that the effects of stocking with hatchery chum salmon vary depending on the interacting species.},

	abstract = {The pathology of glochidial infection of the freshwater mussel Margaritifera margaritifera was examined in farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in fresh water and for 150 days after transfer of salmon to sea water. Prevalence of infection in fresh water was 95\%, mean abundance 134 per fish and mean infection intensity 140. Prevalence in sea water was 80-94\% in the first 7 weeks after transfer but glochidia were absent, apart from remains, after 50 days in sea water. Glochidia on salmon in fresh water were associated with localized hyperplasia and fusion of secondary gill lamellae. Focally extensive epithelial hyperplasia and fusion of secondary lamellae were present 4-10 days after transfer to sea water. Twenty-three days after transfer, small nodules with a more discrete appearance were present suggesting partial resolution of tissue response; hyperplastic responses associated with glochidia were much reduced after 50 days. Plasma chloride in infected fish 10 days after transfer was 153 mmol.l(-1), significantly higher than fish without infection, suggesting poorer adaptation to sea water. No mortalities due to glochidial infection in sea water were recorded and there was no significant difference in mean weight between infected and control fish.

	abstract = {Experimental infection of pearl mussel glochidia on the performance of Atlantic salmon hosts was examined. Infection intensity was 1392 641 SD glochidia per fish six weeks after challenge but declined significantly 15 weeks after infection to means of 50 and 112 fish(-1) in two trial tanks and, by 6 months numbers were {\textless} 1 fish(-1). This loss was attributed to fungal treatments with a combination of malachite green which was still the authorised treatment during the study in 2001 and formalin. The weight of infected fish was significantly lower than controls at 15 weeks but this was not significant after I year. The condition factor of infected and naive fish was not significantly different. Lactate was measured as a possible indicator of stress in infected fish but there was no significant difference with controls. Fish that had been previously infected with glochidia were re-infected in their second year and comparison made with infection of naive fish to determine whether glochidial infection elicits an immune response. Although there was no significant difference in glochidial numbers in both groups at around 9000 glochidia host(-1) 3 weeks after infection, numbers of glochidia in naive fish did not change to 15 weeks after challenge, whereas there was a significant reduction in previously infected fish to 116 fish(-1). Various treatments were used to provoke closure of the glochidial valves. It is concluded that infection of salmon with glochidia levels in the current study had no significant effect on salmon performance, condition and stress as measured by assay of lactate.

This ME-type population is the first recorded from Kyushu Island, Japan. An ecological survey of the population revealed that females spawned larger eggs (2.8-3.2 mm in diameter) than those of other amphidromous populations, from which well-developed yolk-sac larvae of about 8.0 mm TL were hatched out. In addition, ME-type specimens collected on 25 and 26 May 2001 included 15 sex-unknown juveniles ranging from 18.8 to 30.2 mm SL, suggesting that they represented larvae hatched out on a nearby spawning ground, with no experience of downstream migration into Isahaya Bay. This observation strongly suggests that the ME-type population in the Honmyo River has a fluvial lifestyle, being different from other amphidromous populations. The former population may have arisen from an amphidromous ancestor through changes in egg size and early ontogenetic development.},

Mobile organisms link important processes across ecosystems, however, their roles in providing these services are often overlooked and we need to know how they influence ecosystem functions in reserves. Herbivorous fish play a key role in coral reef seascapes. By removing algae, they promote coral growth and recruitment, and help to increase resilience. We examined how connectivity with mangroves affected herbivore populations and benthic succession on reefs in eastern Australia. We surveyed fish assemblages, examined reef composition and characterised benthic recruitment on reefs at multiple levels of connectivity with mangroves, in a no-take reserve and areas open to fishing. Our results show that connectivity enhanced herbivore biomass and richness in reserves, and that these connectivity and reserve effects interacted to promote herbivory on protected reefs near mangroves. Connectivity and reserve protection combined to double the biomass of roving herbivorous fish on protected reefs near mangroves. The increase in grazing intensity drove a trophic cascade that reduced algal cover and enhanced coral recruitment and reef resilience. Synthesis and applications. Our findings demonstrate that ecosystem resilience can be improved by managing both reefs and adjacent habitats together as functional seascape units. By understanding how landscapes influence resilience, and explicitly incorporating these effects into conservation decision-making, we may have greater success with environmental restoration and preservation actions.},

	abstract = {Larval sea lamprey inhabit freshwater streams and migrate to oceans or lakes to feed after a radical metamorphosis; subsequently, mature adults return to streams to spawn. Previous observations suggested that lamprey utilize the odor of conspecific larvae to select streams for spawning. Here we report biochemical and electrophysiological evidence that this odor is comprised of two unique bile acids released by larvae. High performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry demonstrated that larval sea lamprey produce and release two unique bile acids, allocholic acid (ACA) and petromyzonol sulfate (PS). Electro-olfactogram (EGG) recording also demonstrated that the olfactory system of migratory adult sea lamprey is acutely and specifically sensitive to ACA and PS; detection thresholds for these compounds were similar to 10(-12) M. ACA and PS were the most potent of 38 bile acids tested and cross-adaptation experiments suggested that adult sea lamprey have specific olfactory receptor sites associated with independent signal transduction pathways for these bile acids. These receptor sites specifically recognize the key substituents of ACA and PS such as a 5 alpha-hydrogen, three axial hydroxyls, and a C-24 sulfate ester or carboxyl. In conclusion, the unique lamprey bile acids, ACA and PS, are potent and specific stimulants of the adult olfactory system, strongly supporting the hypothesis that these unique bile acids function as migratory pheromones in lamprey.},

	abstract = {1. Faced with widespread degradation of riverine ecosystems, stream restoration has greatly increased. Such restoration is rarely planned and executed with inputs from ecological theory. In this paper, we seek to identify principles from ecological theory that have been, or could be, used to guide stream restoration.
2. In attempts to re-establish populations, knowledge of the species' life history, habitat template and spatio-temporal scope is critical. In many cases dispersal will be a critical process in maintaining viable populations at the landscape scale, and special attention should be given to the unique geometry of stream systems
3. One way by which organisms survive natural disturbances is by the use of refugia, many forms of which may have been lost with degradation. Restoring refugia may therefore be critical to survival of target populations, particularly in facilitating resilience to ongoing anthropogenic disturbance regimes.
4. Restoring connectivity, especially longitudinal connectivity, has been a major restoration goal. In restoring lateral connectivity there has been an increasing awareness of the riparian zone as a critical transition zone between streams and their catchments.
5. Increased knowledge of food web structure - bottom-up versus top-down control, trophic cascades and subsidies - are yet to be applied to stream restoration efforts.
6. In restoration, species are drawn from the regional species pool. Having overcome dispersal and environmental constraints (filters), species persistence may be governed by local internal dynamics, which are referred to as assembly rules.
7. While restoration projects often define goals and endpoints, the succession pathways and mechanisms (e.g. facilitation) by which these may be achieved are rarely considered. This occurs in spite of a large of body of general theory on which to draw.
8. Stream restoration has neglected ecosystem processes. The concept that increasing biodiversity increases ecosystem functioning is very relevant to stream restoration. Whether biodiversity affects ecosystem processes, such as decomposition, in streams is equivocal.
9. Considering the spatial scale of restoration projects is critical to success. Success is more likely with large-scale projects, but they will often be infeasible in terms of the available resources and conflicts of interest. Small-scale restoration may remedy specific problems. In general, restoration should occur at the appropriate spatial scale such that restoration is not reversed by the prevailing disturbance regime.
10. The effectiveness and predictability of stream ecosystem restoration will improve with an increased understanding of the processes by which ecosystems develop and are maintained. Ideas from general ecological theory can clearly be better incorporated into stream restoration projects. This will provide a twofold benefit in providing an opportunity both to improve restoration outcomes and to test ecological theory.},

A comparison of microhabitat use between small-(less than or equal to5cm) and large-sized larvae ({\textgreater}5cm) indicated the latter utilized the space with greater ranges in both water depth and substrate particle size than the former. Both the field survey and laboratory experiments on larval selectivity of physical habitat variables clearly demonstrated that substrate particle size was the most important variable for small-sized larvae whereas both water depth and substrate depth were more important for large larvae.

All males included the nest rocks in their home ranges, but the timing of nest occupation was apparently dependent on male size, suggesting the presence of male-male competition for the nest rocks. Females, on the other hand, exhibited two different patterns in space use, independent of body size: (1) they spawned in their home ranges, or (2) they spawned out of their home ranges and returned. Nest cavity area did not affect male reproductive success. Spatial separation between female home ranges and nest location was the main reason for the females' movement out of their home ranges. The limitation in the male mating phase (5.7 days on average) might also have forced the females to move out of their home range to spawn. The reason behind such temporal limitation in the male mating interval was discussed from the viewpoint of the energy cost accompanying male parental care.},

	abstract = {The meanders and floodplains of the Kushiro River were restored in March 2011. A 1.6-km stretch of the straightened main channel was remeandered by reconnecting the cutoff former channel and backfilling the straightened reach, and a 2.4-km meander channel was restored. Additionally, flood levees were removed to promote river-floodplain interactions. There were four objectives of this restoration project: to restore the in-stream habitat for native fish and invertebrates; to restore floodplain vegetation by increasing flooding frequency and raising the groundwater table; to reduce sediment and nutrient loads in the core wetland areas; to restore a river-floodplain landscape typical to naturally meandering rivers. In this project, not only the natural landscape of a meandering river but also its function was successfully restored. The monitoring results indicated that these goals were likely achieved in the short term after the restoration. The abundance and species richness of fish and invertebrate species increased, most likely because the lentic species that formerly inhabited the cutoff channel remained in the backwater and deep pools created in the restored reach. In addition, lotic species immigrated from neighboring reaches. The removal of flood levees and backfilling of the formerly straightened reach were very effective in increasing the frequency of flooding over the floodplains and raising the water table. The wetland vegetation recovered rapidly 1 year after the completion of the meander restoration. Sediment-laden floodwater spread over the floodplain, and approximately 80-90\% of the fine sediment carried by the water was filtered out by the wetland vegetation.},

Different carabid species showed similar delta(15)N values, which were higher than those of their possible invertebrate prey (herbivores and detritivores) collected from the litter layer, indicating that these species were consumers in the same trophic level. In contrast, delta(13)C values differed among carabid species, indicating interspecific differences in prey animals. The variation in the delta(13)C value was larger in summer than in autumn. In summer, delta(13)C values indicated that some carabids depended highly on either grazing (low delta(13)C values) or detrital sources (high delta(13)C values) within the food chain [Chlaenius posticalis Motschulsky and Haplochlaenius costiger (Chaudoir), respectively], although other species with intermediate delta(13)C values likely depended on both. The latter group of species comprised mostly two dominant genera (Carabus and Synuchus). Although congeners might have similar feeding habits, the stable isotope ratios indicated trophic niche differences between adults of different species and between adults and larvae of the same genus.},

We performed measurements of nitrogen and carbon stable isotope ratios in consumers and in their potential food items, and estimated relative contributions of different food items with two mixing models, IsoSource and MixSIR.
3. IsoSource and MixSIR software gave similar results, but IsoSource tended to calculate higher contributions of principal food items and smaller percentile ranges than MixSIR. Among harparine beetle species, there were diverse food utilisation patterns among four food categories (detritivorous invertebrates, herbivorous invertebrates, C3 plants, and C4 plants). Detritivores comprised the main diets of abundant harpaline species in the spring, whereas abundant harpaline species in the autumn were primarily herbivores feeding on C4 plants, or omnivores feeding on herbivorous invertebrates and C3 plants. Seasonal changes in food use were related to seasonal changes in the abundance of each food resource.
4. Mixing model analysis of stable isotope ratios is a convenient and effective method for roughly estimating diets of many species with diverse food habits (such as ground beetles). This method can contribute to determining the trophic relationships of related insects in one ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Previous studies evaluating the success of river restorations have rarely found any consistent effects on benthic invertebrate assemblages. In this study, we analyzed data from 24 river restoration projects in Germany dating back 1 to 12 years and 1231 data sets from adjacent river reaches that lie within 0-5, 5-10, and 10-15 km rings centered on the restored sites. We calculated restoration success and recolonization potential of adjacent river reaches based on stream-type-specific subsets of taxa indicative for good or bad habitat quality. On average, the restorations did not improve the benthic invertebrate community quality. However, we show that restoration success depends on the presence of source populations of desired taxa in the surrounding of restored sites. Only where source populations of additional desired taxa existed within a 0-5 km ring around the restored sites were benthic invertebrate assemblages improved by the restoration. Beyond the 5-km rings, this recolonization effect was no longer detected. We present here the first field results to support the debated argument that a lack of source populations in the areas surrounding restored sites may play an important role in the failure to establish desired invertebrate communities by the means of river restorations. In contrast, long-range dispersal of invertebrates seems to play a subordinate role in the recolonization of restored sites. However, because the surroundings of the restored sites were far from good ecological quality, the potential for improvement of restored sites was limited.},

	title = {Tangled webs: reciprocal flows of invertebrate prey link streams and riparian zones},
	volume = {50},
	issn = {0046-5070},
	abstract = {1. Streams and their adjacent riparian zones are closely linked by reciprocal flows of invertebrate prey. We review characteristics of these prey subsidies and their strong direct and indirect effects on consumers and recipient food webs.
2. Fluxes of terrestrial invertebrates to streams can provide up to half the annual energy budget for drift-feeding fishes such as salmonids, despite the fact that input occurs principally in summer. Inputs appear highest from closed-canopy riparian zones with deciduous vegetation and vary markedly with invertebrate phenology and weather. Two field experiments that manipulated this prey subsidy showed that it affected both foraging and local abundance of stream fishes.
3. Emergence of adult insects from streams can constitute a substantial export of benthic production to riparian consumers such as birds, bats, lizards, and spiders, and contributes 25-100 \% of the energy or carbon to such species. Emergence typically peaks in early summer in the temperate zone, but also provides a low-level flux from autumn to spring in ice-free streams. This flux varies with in-stream productivity, and declines exponentially with distance from the stream edge. Some predators aggregate near streams and forage on these prey during periods of peak emergence, whereas others rely on the lower subsidy from autumn through spring when terrestrial prey are scarce. Several field experiments that manipulated this subsidy showed that it affected the short-term behaviour, growth, and abundance of terrestrial consumers.
4. Reciprocal prey subsidies also have important indirect effects on both stream and riparian food webs. Theory predicts that allochthonous prey should increase density of subsidised predators, thereby increasing predation on in situ prey and causing a negative indirect effect via apparent competition. However, short-term experiments have produced either positive or negative indirect effects. These contrasting results may be due to characteristics of the subsidies and individual consumers, but could also result from differences in experimental designs.
5. New study approaches are needed to better determine the direct and indirect effects of reciprocal prey subsidies. Experiments coupled with comparative research will be required to measure their effects on individual consumer fitness and population demographics. Future work should investigate whether reciprocal prey fluxes stabilise linked stream-riparian ecosystems, explore how landscape context affects the magnitude and importance of subsidies, and determine how impacts of human disturbance can propagate between streams and riparian zones via these trophic linkages. Study of thesereciprocal connections is helping to define a more holistic perspective of catchments, and has the potential to shape new directions for ecology in general.},

	abstract = {Conservation of freshwater animal populations requires their access to, as well as sufficient availability of, critical habitats, such as those for reproduction. Abundant small-scale barriers may cause extensive fragmentation of freshwater habitat but, by comparison to larger structures their effects are rarely considered by catchment managers. The relationship between the distribution of, and access to, spawning habitat in a regulated river, characterized by abundant small barriers, was examined for river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis, a threatened migratory fish.
Telemetry of adult lamprey in the River Derwent, North East England was used to quantify upriver migration and access to spawning habitat, together with surveys of spawning habitat availability and spawning activity between 2002 and 2007.
Access in to the Derwent appeared severely restricted by a tidal barrage, beyond which lamprey migrated rapidly in unobstructed reaches. Of all lamprey tagged in the lower 4 km of river, or ascending the barrage, 64\% and 17\% passed the first and second weirs respectively, with high flows crucial for this. Although over 98\% of lamprey spawning habitat occurred more than 51 km upstream, on average just 1.8\% of river lamprey spawners were recorded there.
In order to protect or rehabilitate species or species assemblages, greater attention needs to be paid to the relative spatial distribution of low-head barriers and the resultant availability of key habitats within individual catchments. This is particularly important given the renewed emphasis internationally on low-head hydropower solutions as a source of renewable energy, and the rapid growth in numbers of low-head barriers in many catchments.},

2. We investigated cross-habitat trophic linkages between canopy and understorey food webs in a terrestrial, wooded, ecosystem in South Florida, USA. The focal community consisted of three species of Anolis lizards and their prey. We described interspecific differences among Anolis species in the strength and routing of these cross-habitat flows using stable isotope analysis, stomach content analysis and habitat use data.
3. All three Anolis species in this study consumed different prey and occupied vertically distinct arboreal habitats. Despite these differences, carbon isotope and stomach content analysis revealed strong integration with understorey and canopy food webs for all Anolis species. Modes of resource flux contributing to the observed cross-habitat trophic linkages included prey movement and the gravity-driven transport of detritus.
4. Our study shows that terrestrial systems are linked by considerable bidirectional cross-system resource flux. Our results also suggest that considering species-specific interactions between predator and prey is necessary to fully understand the diversity of material and energy flows between spatially separated habitats.},

	abstract = {Studies of the effects of cross-habitat resource subsidies have been a feature of food web ecology over the past decade. To date, most studies have focused on demonstrating the magnitude of a subsidy or documenting its effect in the recipient habitat. Ecologists have yet to develop a satisfactory framework for predicting the magnitude of these effects. We used 115 data sets from 32 studies to compare consumer responses to resource subsidies across recipient habitat type, trophic level, and functional group. Changes in consumer density or biomass in response to subsidies were inconsistent across habitats, trophic, and functional groups. Responses in stream cobble bar and coastline habitats were larger than in other habitats. Contrary to expectation, the magnitude of consumer response was not affected by recipient habitat productivity or the ratio of productivity between donor and recipient habitats. However, consumer response was significantly related to the ratio of subsidy resources to equivalent resources in the recipient habitat. Broad contrasts in productivity are modified by subsidy type, vector, and the physical and biotic characteristics of both donor and recipient habitats. For this reason, the ratio of subsidy to equivalent resources is a more useful tool for predicting the possible effect of a subsidy than coarser contrasts of in situ productivity. The commonness of subsidy effects suggests that many ecosystems need to be studied as open systems.},

Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.},

We review results from 91 studies on Allee effects in natural animal populations. We focus on empirical signatures that are used or might be used to detect Allee effects, the types of data in which Allee effects are evident, the empirical support for the occurrence of critical densities in natural populations, and differences among taxa both in the presence of Allee effects and primary causal mechanisms. We find that conclusive examples are known from Mollusca, Arthropoda, and Chordata, including three classes of vertebrates, and are most commonly documented to result from mate limitation in invertebrates and from predator-prey interactions in vertebrates. More than half of studies failed to distinguish component and demographic Allee effects in data, although the distinction is crucial to most of the population-level dynamic implications associated with Allee effects (e.g., the existence of an unstable critical density associated with strong Allee effects). Thus, although we find conclusive evidence for Allee effects due to a variety of mechanisms in natural populations of 59 animal species, we also find that existing data addressing the strength and commonness of Allee effects across species and populations is limited; evidence for a critical density for most populations is lacking. We suggest that current studies, mainly observational in nature, should be supplemented by population-scale experiments and approaches connecting component and demographic effects.},

	abstract = {Drought is an important natural disturbance that influences community structure by altering species composition, abundance, and richness. Human-induced alterations of the hydrologic cycle and climate change can exacerbate the impact of drought, potentially leading to species extirpations and changes in community structure. These changes in community structure can lead to substantial alterations and losses of ecosystem functions. Nutrient recycling is an important ecosystem function that helps modify rates of production and food web structure. Animals are important in cycling and storing nutrients in aquatic ecosystems through feeding, growth, and excretion. Freshwater mussels are long-lived animals, often living more than 20 years, and perform important ecosystem functions such as nutrient storage and cycling. Mussels dominate benthic biomass in many aquatic systems, and thus can be an essential component affecting nutrient dynamics, Unfortunately, they are experiencing rapid declines. In this study, we surveyed freshwater mussel populations across nine sites in three rivers in the south-central U.S. immediately before and after an exceptional, regional drought. We characterized the hydrological severity of the drought and estimated mussel biomass loss and the consequent loss of mussel-provided nutrient cycling and storage. We determined if losses differed between mussel thermal guilds and how such losses might influence nutrient dynamics and stoichiometry. Additionally, we investigated whether losses caused by the drought were intensified by different land cover types. Our surveys indicated that there were declines in both density and biomass of mussels, and greater losses were associated with areas that had less forest cover. This die-off resulted in a lower availability of N and reduced P storage by freshwater mussels in these rivers, potentially altering system nutrient availability. Additionally, our analyses showed that thermally sensitive species have lower tissue N:P. Thus, our results show that differences in species tolerance to drought may lead to varying storage and release of nutrients. Further studies incorporating net flux and storage will allow scientists to better understand the repercussions of species loss to ecosystem function. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We compare predictions for three subpopulations of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (those occupying kelp beds, barrens, and grazing fronts) to observations from small-scale experiments, and estimate effects of population size and current velocity in each subpopulation. Model outputs suggest that fertilization rates are low in kelp beds, intermediate in barrens, and high in grazing fronts. In all populations, increasing current velocity has a negative effect on the relationship between fertilization rate and downstream distance of gametes after release, but no effect on the relationship between fertilization rate and elapsed time since gamete release. Our model output was most sensitive to changes in the number of spawning males and the sperm release rate, suggesting that spawning synchrony and high gonadic index could greatly increase the fertilization success in sea urchins.},

	abstract = {The broadcast spawning reproductive strategy relies on turbulent-stirring processes in the flow to bring together gametes previously released by adult males and females. The subsequent fertilization rate depends on the product of co-occurring concentrations of egg and sperm. Turbulent mixing produces a strong average dilution in these concentrations, suggesting that an increase in turbulence would reduce the average local fertilization rate. However, turbulent dilution occurs at time scales that may be long compared to those associated with fertilization. Therefore, the instantaneous structure of egg and sperm filaments at shorter time scales must be considered. In this paper, a mechanism is proposed whereby coherent turbulent structures in the velocity field cause coalescence between high-concentration filaments of egg and sperm, significantly enhancing the average fertilization rate. Simple analytical and numerical models are used to demonstrate how the mechanism works, and to make qualitative estimates of its effect on the resulting fertilization rate. The results suggest that the efficiency of broadcast spawning is a consequence of features in the instantaneous turbulent field, and that this efficiency is not captured by models that consider only time-averaged features of the flow.

This has led to the suggestion that environmental forcing dominates species dynamics; however, synchronous and compensatory dynamics may appear at different length scales and/or at different times, making it challenging to identify their relative importance. We compiled 58 long-term datasets of zooplankton abundance in north-temperate and subtropical lakes and used wavelet analysis to quantify general patterns in the times and scales at which synchronous/compensatory dynamics dominated zooplankton communities in different regions and across the entire dataset. Synchronous dynamics were far more prevalent at all scales and times and were ubiquitous at the annual scale. Although we found compensatory dynamics in approximately 14\% of all combinations of time period/scale/lake, there were no consistent scales or time periods during which compensatory dynamics were apparent across different regions. Our results suggest that the processes driving compensatory dynamics may be local in their extent, while those generating synchronous dynamics operate at much larger scales.

An alternative pathway for N to escape streams is in the form of emerging aquatic insects, and unlike denitrification, previous studies suggest that this pathway may be stimulated by increased availability of P. We tested the hypothesis that the flux of N exported from streams through insect emergence increases relative to flux through denitrification with increasing levels of stream P. We measured emergence and denitrification rates at 7 lowland stream sites in Costa Rica that differ in dissolved P levels and substrate characteristics. Emergence N flux ranged from 2.0 to 16.3\% of measured denitrification rates and was not related to any measured physical or chemical variables. Sediment redox conditions were the best predictor of denitrification rates. Our emergence results suggest that most invertebrate biomass production in these streams is consumed by in-stream predators, keeping this N in the stream ecosystem. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that in streams with low denitrification rates, emergence should be considered as an additional pathway of N removal from stream ecosystems.},

To investigate the role of emerging aquatic insects in dispersing salmon nutrients from spawning streams to riparian habitats, we quantified the emergence and return rates of mayflies (Ephemeroptera), stoneflies (Plecoptera), and caddisflies (Trichoptera) on Pick Creek in southwestern Alaska and, using stable isotopes, estimated the associated flux of nutrients derived from sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) to streamside forests. Between June and September of 2004, 7.6 mg center dot m(-2) of salmon-derived nitrogen emerged from Pick Creek in the form of aquatic invertebrates, 6.7 mg center dot m(-2) of which was transferred to the terrestrial ecosystem. Dispersal patterns on four area streams showed that the majority of stream-borne nutrients are deposited within 25 m of the stream. Aquatic insects represent a minor vector for salmon nutrients to terrestrial systems, dispersing less than 0.03\% of total nitrogen imported to Pick Creek by spawning salmon. Nevertheless, emerging insects make available salmon-derived resources otherwise inaccessible to some terrestrial consumers.},

	abstract = {There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem processes in changing environments, but the mechanisms that underlie this effect are still controversial and poorly understood. Here, we extend mechanistic theory of ecosystem stability in competitive communities to clarify the mechanisms underlying diversitystability relationships. We first explain why, contrary to a widely held belief, interspecific competition should generally play a destabilising role. We then explore the stabilising effect of differences in species' intrinsic rates of natural increase and provide a synthesis of various potentially stabilising mechanisms. Three main mechanisms are likely to operate in the stabilising effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties: (1) asynchrony of species' intrinsic responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) differences in the speed at which species respond to perturbations, (3) reduction in the strength of competition. The first two mechanisms involve temporal complementarity between species, while the third results from functional complementarity. Additional potential mechanisms include selection effects, behavioural changes resulting from species interactions and mechanisms arising from trophic or non-trophic interactions and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that mechanistic trait-based approaches are key to predicting the effects of diversity on ecosystem stability and to bringing the old diversitystability debate to a final resolution.},

We analyzed nine long-term data sets of grassland species composition to investigate how two key environmental factors, precipitation amount and variability, may directly influence community stability and how they may indirectly influence stability via biotic mechanisms. We found that the importance of stability mechanisms varied along the environmental gradient: strong negative species covariance occurred in sites characterized by high precipitation variability, whereas portfolio effects increased in sites with high mean annual precipitation. Instead of questioning whether compensatory dynamics are important in nature, our findings suggest that debate should widen to include several stability mechanisms and how these mechanisms vary in importance across environmental gradients.},

	abstract = {1. Riverine systems consist of a mosaic of patches and habitats linked by diverse processes and supporting highly complex communities. Invertebrates show a high taxonomic and functional diversity in riverine systems and are in several ways important components of these systems. Their distribution patterns, movements and effects on ecological flows, testify to their importance in various landscape ecological processes. This paper reviews the invertebrate literature with respect to patterns and processes in the riverine landscape. 2. The distribution of invertebrates in riverine habitats is governed by a number of factors that typically act at different scales. Hence, the local community structure can be seen as the result of a continuous sorting process through environmental filters ranging from regional or catchment-wide processes, involving speciation, geological history and climate, to the small-scale characteristics of individual patches, such as local predation risk, substratum porosity and current velocity. 3. Dispersal is an important process driving invertebrate distribution, linking different ecological systems across boundaries. Dispersal occurs within the aquatic habitat as well as into the terrestrial surrounding, and also over land to other waterbodies. New genetic techniques have contributed significantly to the understanding of aquatic invertebrate dispersal and revealed the importance of factors such as physical barriers, synchrony of emergence and taxonomic affiliation. 4. Invertebrates affect the cycling of nutrients and carbon by being a crucial intermediate link between primary producers, detritus pools or primary consumers, and predators higher up in the trophic hierarchy. Suspension feeders increase the retention of carbon. The subsidies of aquatic invertebrates to the terrestrial ecosystem have been shown to be important, as are reciprocal processes such as the supply of terrestrial invertebrates that fall into the water. 5. Future studies are needed both to advance theoretical aspects of landscape ecology pertaining to the invertebrates in riverine systems and to intensify the experimental testing of hypotheses, for example with respect to the scaling of processes and to linkages between the terrestrial and aquatic systems. Another promising avenue is to take advantage of naturally steep environmental gradients, and of systems disturbed by humans, such as regulated rivers. By comparison with unimpaired reference sites, the mechanisms involved might be identified. The use of 'natural' experiments, especially where environmental gradients are steep, is another technique with great potential.},

Ecosystems may affect each other through trophic interactions that cross ecosystem boundaries as well as via the transfer of subsidies, but these effects can vary depending on the identity of species involved in the interaction. 2. In this study, we manipulated two terrestrial bromeliad-living spider species (Aglaoctenus castaneus, Corinna gr. rubripes) that have variable hunting modes, to test their individual and combined effects on aquatic invertebrate community structure and ecosystem processes (i.e. decomposition rate and nitrogen cycling). We predicted that these terrestrial predators can affect aquatic invertebrates and nutrient dynamics within water-filled bromeliads. 3. Aglaoctenus spiders reduced the richness, abundance and biomass of aquatic insect larvae via consumptive or non-consumptive effects on ovipositing terrestrial adults, but effects of the two spider species in combination were usually the linear average of their monoculture effects. In contrast, invertebrates with entirely aquatic life cycles were unaffected or facilitated by spiders. Spiders did not affect either net detritivore biomass or the flux of detrital nitrogen to the bromeliad. Instead, Corinna spiders contributed allochthonous nitrogen to bromeliads. 4. Our results provide the novel observations that predators in one ecosystem not only directly reduce taxa whose life cycles cross-ecosystem boundaries, but also indirectly facilitate taxa whose life cycles are entirely within the second ecosystem. This compensatory response between cross-ecosystem and within-ecosystem taxa may have led to an attenuation of top-down effects across ecosystem boundaries. In addition, our results add to a growing consensus that species identity is an important determinant of community structure and ecosystem functioning. Thus, the composition of both terrestrial and aquatic food webs may affect the strength of cross-ecosystem interactions.},

In the present study, changes in N-15/N-14 and C-13/C-12 ratios in the lycosid spider Pardosa lugubris (Araneae: Lycosidae), fed with prey of different quality, were investigated. Experimental food chains included three trophic levels: prey media, prey organism and predator. In order to analyse the time course of stable isotope enrichment, different life stages of R lugubris feeding on Drosophila melanogaster were studied. The N-15 content of hatchlings of P. lugubris was significantly lower than that of their mothers, indicating the existence of nitrogen pools with different N-15 signatures in female P. lugubris. With duration of feeding and progressing development, age and body weight, the N-15 content in spiderlings increased. Starvation resulted in N-15 and C-13 enrichment in P. lugubris. Being fed with prey of different quality resulted in varying patterns of stable isotope enrichment. N-15 but not C-13 content consistently increased when fed on high quality prey (Heteromurus nitidus, D. melanogaster and a mixed diet consisting of H. nitidus and D. melanogaster). In contrast, low quality prey (Rhopalosiphum padi, Folsomia candida and a mixed diet consisting, of H. nitidus, D. melanogaster and F candida) resulted in deviations from postulated patterns of stable isotope enrichment with N-15 content being similar to that of starving spiderlings. When fed on high quality prey, N-15 enrichment of R lugubris was close to ca. 3parts per thousand. It is concluded that the analysis of variations in the natural abundance of stable isotopes is particularly helpful in revealing the trophic structure of terrestrial food webs in which polyphagous feeders predominate, as is the case in litter and soil.},

A diet switching experiment utilizing a predatory ladybird beetle, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze), evaluated the use of naturally occurring stable C and N isotopes as an economically feasible and safe method for quantifying pathways of energy flow within agroecosystems. Stable isotope values of the ladybird beetle Coleomegilla maculata lengi (Timberlake) collected from an agroecosystem were used to estimate the relative amount of C and N derived from agricultural plants and incorporated by ladybird beetles based on mass balance equations. At the beginning of the diet-switching experiment delta(13)C and delta(15)N values of H. variegata (-12.0 parts per thousand and 6.3 parts per thousand, respectively) differed by -0.2 parts per thousand and 2.9 parts per thousand from the aphids that were provided exclusively as their diet. These data are consistent with previous estimates of trophic level isotope effects. After switching the diet of H. variegata to an alternative food, isotope values of H. variegata gradually shifted toward expected values for individuals fed this diet (-22.9 parts per thousand and 8.8 parts per thousand for delta(13)C and delta(15)N values, respectively). Isotope values of another ladybird beetle, C. maculata, collected from the field indicated that in May, alfalfa and maize (pollen) obtained in the previous year contributed 32\% and 68\% of the C or N to the diets of these individuals and in August, 52\%, 6\%, and 42\% of the C or N assimilated by these insects was derived from alfalfa, wheat, and maize, respectively. These data are consistent with expectations based on the relative abundance of C. maculata in various crops during the season. The field and laboratory data are a clear indication that isotope values are sensitive to dietary changes on a relatively short time scale (days) and provide a strong basis for the use stable C and N isotope to trace energy flow patterns of these beneficial organisms within agroecosystems.},

However, it remains unknown whether these findings are relevant to natural ecosystems, especially those for which species diversity is threatened by anthropogenic global change(8-11). Here we analyse diversity-stability relationships from 41 grasslands on five continents and examine how these relationships are affected by chronic fertilization, one of the strongest drivers of species loss globally(8). Unmanipulated communities with more species had greater species asynchrony, resulting in more stable biomass production, generalizing a result from biodiversity experiments to real-world grasslands. However, fertilization weakened the positive effect of diversity on stability. Contrary to expectations, this was not due to species loss after eutrophication but rather to an increase in the temporal variation of productivity in combination with a decrease in species asynchrony in diverse communities. Our results demonstrate separate and synergistic effects of diversity and eutrophication on stability, emphasizing the need to understand how drivers of global change interactively affect the reliable provisioning of ecosystem services in real-world systems.},

Here we review previous ecological applications of MAR models and highlight their ability to identify abiotic and biotic drivers of population dynamics, as well as community-level stability metrics, from long-term empirical observations. Thus far, MAR models have been used mainly with data from freshwater plankton communities; we examine the obstacles that may be hindering adoption in other systems and suggest practical modifications that will improve MAR models for broader application. Many of these modifications are already well known in other fields in which MAR models are common, although they are frequently described under different names. In an effort to make MAR models more accessible to ecologists, we include a worked example using recently developed R packages (MAR1 and MARSS), freely available and open-access software.},

	abstract = {Aquatic insects are a common and important subsidy to terrestrial systems, yet little is known about how these inputs affect terrestrial food webs, especially around lakes. Myvatn, a lake in northern Iceland, has extraordinary midge (Chironomidae) emergences that result in large inputs of biomass and nutrients to terrestrial arthropod communities. We simulated this lake-to-land resource pulse by collecting midges from Myvatn and spreading their dried carcasses on 1-m(2) plots at a nearby site that receives very little midge deposition. We hypothesized a positive bottom-up response of detritivores that would be transmitted to their predators and would persist into the following year. We sampled the arthropod community once per month for two consecutive summers. Midge addition resulted in significantly different arthropod communities and increased densities of some taxa in both years. Detritivores, specifically Diptera larvae, Collembola, and Acari increased in midge-addition plots, and so did some predators and parasitoids. Arthropod densities were still elevated a year after midge addition, and two years of midge addition further increased the density of higher-order consumers (e.g., Coleoptera and Hymenoptera). Midge addition increased arthropod biomass by 68\% after one year and 108\% after two years. By manipulating the nutrient pulse delivered by midges we were able to elucidate food web consequences of midge deposition and spatial and temporal dynamics that are difficult to determine based on comparative approaches alone. Resources cross ecosystem boundaries and are assimilated over time because of life-history strategies that connect aquatic and terrestrial food webs and these systems cannot be fully understood in isolation from each other.},

	abstract = {Understanding how complex food webs assemble through time is fundamental both for ecological theory and for the development of sustainable strategies of ecosystem conservation and restoration. The build-up of complexity in communities is theoretically difficult, because in random-pattern models complexity leads to instability(1). There is growing evidence, however, that nonrandom patterns in the strengths of the interactions between predators and prey strongly enhance system stability(2-4). Here we show how such patterns explain stability in naturally assembling communities. We present two series of below-ground food webs along natural productivity gradients in vegetation successions(5,6). The complexity of the food webs increased along the gradients. The stability of the food webs was captured by measuring the weight of feedback loops(7) of three interacting 'species' locked in omnivory. Low predator-prey biomass ratios in these omnivorous loops were shown to have a crucial role in preserving stability as productivity and complexity increased during succession. Our results show the build-up of food-web complexity in natural productivity gradients and pin down the feedback loops that govern the stability of whole webs. They show that it is the heaviest three-link feedback loop in a network of predator-prey effects that limits its stability. Because the weight of these feedback loops is kept relatively low by the biomass build-up in the successional process, complexity does not lead to instability.},

However, empirical evidence for a relationship between beta-diversity (spatial turnover in community structure) and temporal stability in community structure remains equivocal, despite important implications for theoretical ecology and conservation biology. Here, we report strong beta-diversity-stability relationships across a broad sample of fish taxa on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. These relationships were robust to random sampling error and spatial and environmental factors, such as latitude, reef size and isolation. While beta-diversity was positively associated with temporal stability at the community level, the relationship was negative for some taxa, for example surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae), one of the most abundant reef fish families. This demonstrates that the beta-diversity-stability relationship should not be indiscriminately assumed for all taxa, but that a species' risk of extirpation in response to disturbance is likely to be taxon specific and trait based. By combining predictions of spatial and temporal turnover across the study area with observations in marine-protected areas, we conclude that protection alone does not necessarily confer temporal stability and that taxon-specific considerations will improve the outcome of conservation efforts.},

Because aquatic resource fluxes can be highly variable in space and time, the subsidy efficiency (i.e. transfer to the recipient food web) is controlled by the short-term aggregative response of riparian consumers.
2. Field manipulations of stream-derived invertebrate prey subsidies were used to examine specific aggregative responses of ground-dwelling arthropods to riverine subsidy pulses in a braided-river (Tagliamento River, NE Italy). Subsidy manipulation comprised short-term reductions of natural stream-derived subsidies and increased subsidies of stream-derived invertebrate prey during four seasons.
3. We hypothesised that specific aggregative responses of riparian arthropods depend on their specialisation on aquatic insects which was inferred from stable isotope analysis. Natural riverine subsidy sources including aquatic insect emergence and surface-drifting organisms were quantified.
4. Arthropods responded significantly with a reduction in abundance by 51\%, at reduced subsidies and an increase by 110\% at increased subsidies, when averaged over all seasons. Different arthropod taxa responded differently to subsidy manipulations in relation to their specialisation on aquatic subsidies: ground beetles with a diet consisting predominantly of aquatic insects responded only to subsidy reductions, indicating that their local abundance was not limited by natural stream-derived subsidies; lycosid spiders with a partly aquatic diet showed no significant response; and ants, although relying on a terrestrial diet, responded positively to added stream-derived invertebrate prey, indicating that stranding of surface-drifting terrestrial invertebrates represented an important subsidy pathway.
5. Ground beetles and lycosid spiders were seasonally separated in their use of aquatic subsidies. Results indicate that the life-history characteristics of riparian consumers can control the subsidy efficiency for the recipient community. By the effective uptake of pulsed riverine-derived subsidies, riparian arthropods can enhance the transfer of riverine food sources to the riparian food web.},

We study the effect of spatial flows on stability and ecosystem functions, and provide simple metrics of connectivity that can predict these effects. Our results show that high rates of nutrient and herbivore movement can destabilize local ecosystem dynamics, leading to spatially heterogeneous equilibria or oscillations across the meta-ecosystem, with generally increased meta-ecosystem primary and secondary production. However, the onset and the spatial scale of these emergent dynamics depend heavily on the spatial structure of the meta-ecosystem and on the relative movement rate of the autotrophs.

Motivated by observations from lakes, where the pelagic food web is often linked to the littoral food web by mobile predators, we constructed a simple model to evaluate the dynamics of two food chains linked by a top predator with prey preference. Linking the two food chains had no qualitative effect on model dynamics, although it did increase the density of the top predator. Instead, the prey preference of the top predator changed the system dynamics. We found a range of prey preferences that could eliminate chaos, dampen oscillations, and even produce point stability in a previously oscillatory system. The strength of prey preference required to produce a point attractor in a previously chaotic system was positively related to the dimension of chaos (a measure of the complexity of chaos). Our results suggest that, although chaos is possible in food webs, common processes like prey preference reduce the potential for chaos.},

Our theoretical analysis shows that coupled fast and slow channels convey both local and non-local stability to food webs.

Stable isotope analysis (delta(13)C, delta(15)N) together with linear mixing models, were used to quantify the importance of aquatic insects as a food source for a riparian arthropod assemblage inhabiting the shore of the braided Tagliamento River (NE Italy). Proportional aquatic prey contributions to riparian arthropod diets differed considerable among taxa. Carabid beetles of the genus Bembidion and Nebria picicornis fed entirely on aquatic insects. Aquatic insects made up 80\% of the diet of the dominant staphylinid beetle Paederidus rubrothoracicus. The diets of the dominant lycosid spiders Arctosa cinerea and Pardosa wagleri consisted of 56 and 48\% aquatic insects, respectively. In contrast, the ant Manica rubida fed mainly on terrestrial sources. The proportion of aquatic insects in the diet of lycosid spiders changed seasonally, being related to the seasonal abundance of lycosid spiders along the stream edge. The degree of spatial and seasonal aggregation of riparian arthropods at the river edge coincided with their proportional use of aquatic subsidies. The results suggest that predation by riparian arthropods is a quantitatively important process in the transfer of aquatic secondary production to the riparian food web.},

Analysis of the input-output characteristics of segments of the salmon life cycle in the Girnock Burn (Northeast Scotland) reveals two independent regulatory processes, one between ova and fry and the other between fry and smolts. Comparison of stock-recruitment relations for Atlantic salmon in Scotland, Ireland, and Canada, reinforced by an extended series of simulation studies, shows that even when comparatively long time series of high quality data are available, it is frequently difficult to exclude the possibility of low stock depensation - an effect whose implication of enhanced extinction risk implies that precautionary management policy would pay special attention to the posssibility of its occurence. A particular feature of our simulation results is their demonstration that inappropriate combination of distinct subpopulations both increases process noise and distorts the expected stock-recruitment relation, thereby greatly reducing the accuracy of any system identification process.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic influences on the natural world are widespread and well studied from various ecological vantage points. Their behavioural implications, however, are comparatively less well understood. We review four categories of influence on natural animal mating systems: habitat fragmentation, climate change, pollution and selective harvesting. We adopt a predictive approach, first reviewing the ecological determinants of mating system variation and then investigating how these determinants may be affected. Habitat fragmentation and climate change are directly altering the two fundamental predictors of mating system variation: the spatial and temporal distributions of resources. Pollution has implications for mating systems, via, for example, feminizing effects of endocrine disrupters and impeded efficacy of sexual communication. The influences of selective harvesting arise from the removal of phenotypic (and in some cases, genetic) variation in sexually selected traits. The ecological (e. g. by serving as an underlying mechanism contributing to Allee effects) and evolutionary (e. g. by driving microevolutionary trajectories that run counter to sexual selection) consequences of mating system disruption may be severe. The current lack of data, however, makes rigorous assessment of these consequences premature. Nevertheless, there is an analytical framework that can be used to make quantitative predictions, and we argue that applying it more broadly will help improve our understanding of the causes and consequences of anthropogenic influences on natural animal mating systems.

Experimental tests for density dependence are lacking for large-bodied, harvested fish because of the difficulty of manipulating population density over large areas. We studied a harvested coral reef fish, Lutjanus apodus (schoolmaster snapper), using eight large, isolated natural reefs (0.4-1.6 ha) in the Bahamas as replicates. An initial observational test for density dependence was followed by a manipulation of population density. The manipulation weakened an association between density and shelter-providing habitat features and revealed a positive effect of population density on recruitment and survival (inverse density dependence), but no effect of density on somatic growth. The snappers on an individual reef were organized into a few shoals, and we hypothesize that large shoals on high-density reefs were less vulnerable to large piscivores (groupers and barracudas) than the small shoals on low-density reefs. Reductions in predation risk for individuals in large social groups are well documented, but because snapper shoals occupied reefs the size of small marine reserves, these ecological interactions may influence the outcome of management actions.},

Among these, water temperature is important because both development rates and mode of reproduction (parthenogenetic or sexual) in Bythotrephes are influenced by temperature. We built a stage-structured model for the population dynamics of Bythotrephes based on the temperature-dependency of events in its life cycle and used the density of resting eggs at the end of each year to track changes in population density. The model was parameterized using data from published laboratory experiments and data on the Bythotrephes population in Harp Lake, Canada, from 1994 to 2005. The parameterized model was then used to simulate the outcome of invasions with different initial resting egg densities under different temperature regimes. A strong Allee effect emerged from the model, i.e. there is a critical threshold density above which the population can establish and below which it goes extinct. We showed analytically that the existence of an Allee effect arises from the model structure and is therefore robust to the parameter values. An increase in temperature reduces the establishment threshold for introductions in the same year as well as for introductions in the previous years. We therefore hypothesize that climate warming might facilitate Bythotrephes invasions. Finally, we study how the establishment threshold is influenced by the timing of the introduction event and thus identify time periods during the year when lakes may be particularly susceptible to Bythotrephes invasions.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10144-009-0146-4},
	abstract = {In this paper, we review mate-finding Allee effects from ecological and evolutionary points of view. We define 'mate-finding' as mate searching in mobile animals, and also as the meeting of gametes for sessile animals and plants (pollination). We consider related issues such as mate quality and choice, sperm limitation and physiological stimulation of reproduction by conspecifics, as well as discussing the role of demographic stochasticity in generating mate-finding Allee effects. We consider the role of component Allee effects due to mate-finding in generating demographic Allee effects (at the population level). Compelling evidence for demographic Allee effects due to mate-finding (as well as via other mechanisms) is still limited, due to difficulties in censusing rare populations or a failure to identify underlying mechanisms, but also because of fitness trade-offs, population spatial structure and metapopulation dynamics, and because the strength of component Allee effects may vary in time and space. Mate-finding Allee effects act on individual fitness and are thus susceptible to change via natural selection. We believe it is useful to distinguish two routes by which evolution can act to mitigate mate-finding Allee effects. The first is evolution of characteristics such as calls, pheromones, hermaphroditism, etc. which make mate-finding more efficient at low density, thus eliminating the Allee effect. Such adaptations are very abundant in the natural world, and may have arisen to avoid Allee effects, although other hypotheses are also possible. The second route is to avoid low density via adaptations such as permanent or periodic aggregation. In this case, the Allee effect is still present, but its effects are avoided. These two strategies may have different consequences in a world where many populations are being artificially reduced to low density: in the first case, population growth rate can be maintained, while in the second case, the mechanism to avoid Allee effects has been destroyed. It is therefore in these latter populations that we predict the greatest evidence for mate-finding Allee effects and associated demographic consequences. This idea is supported by the existing empirical evidence for demographic Allee effects. Given a strong effect that mate-finding appears to have on individual fitness, we support the continuing quest to find connections between component mate-finding Allee effects (individual reproductive fitness) and the demographic consequences. There are many reasons why such studies are difficult, but it is important, particularly given the increasing number of populations and species of conservation concern, that the ecological community understands more about how widespread demographic Allee effects really are, and why.},

	abstract = {1. Small and low-density populations often suffer significant reductions in reproduction, as exemplified by studies on rare and threatened species. While this phenomenon is less studied in common species, if general, it should not be restricted to those in peril. We addressed this assertion by examining the effects of plant abundance, measured at population-level (population size, density) and local-level (local neighbourhood size, LNS) spatial scales, on fruit set, seed set and subsequent reproductive success (RS) across 19 natural populations of the widespread biennial Sabatia angularis (Gentianaceae). We also examined stigmatic pollen loads across a subset of populations to address whether changes in reproduction were related to reduced pollination. 2. Effects of plant abundance on reproduction were evident at both spatial scales. At the population level, population size - but not density - affected fruit set significantly. This effect was non-linear. Fruit set in populations larger than 15 individuals was relatively constant, but dropped abruptly in populations below that size. This relationship did not prevail between population size and RS. Instead, RS declined significantly with population density. 3. At the local level, increases in LNS between 1-m and 4-m radii from study plants increased fruit set significantly. In contrast, increases within 1 m significantly reduced seed set. Both of these effects prevailed at different spatial scales for RS; increases in 1-m LNS reduced RS, but increases beyond that distance and within 4 m increased RS. 4. Although non-significant, trends in the data are consistent with facilitative interactions for pollination influencing local-level effects on fruit set. However, negative interactions, presumably because of competition for resources, are more important for determining seed set at local scales. Both interactions influence RS, but the effect of competition appears to dominate at the population level. 5. Synthesis. This study demonstrates that although significant reductions in fruit set in small S. angularis populations imply that common species are not impervious to reproductive disadvantages, small populations need not experience reduced RS. Furthermore, low-density populations actually enjoy increased RS. As such, this study highlights the complexity of ecological interactions affecting reproduction and the importance of incorporating multiple spatial scales when examining population dynamics.},

	abstract = {The survival and reproduction of individual plants may be related to the distribution of conspecific neighbours with which they interact. We used 2 years' data from a field experiment to relate the reproduction and survival of focal Silene latifolia plants to the numbers of conspecific plants and flowers within a range of distances (0.16-150 m) from the focal plants. Thus we consider spatial scale as a continuously-varying component of population density. Because the data come from a single continuous population, we fitted regression models in two stages in order to remove spatial autocorrelation induced by environmental factors before modelling density effects. As well as single-scale models, we fitted multiple-scale models to explore interaction kernels. We statistically standardized plant size in some analyses to isolate pollination effects. Reproductive output per plant generally decreased with greater densities of plants and flowers; for example there was a negative effect of female flowers within a 70-m radius in the second year. However, at low female densities there was a positive effect of male flowers at a scale of 13 m in the first year. Seed-set per flower decreased with greater densities of flowers in the second year (at radii {\textless} 10 m). Seed predation was greater when more female flowers were present within 5-7 m. Plants' survival probability increased with density within 0.28 m for all but the smallest plants. We also collected data on the pattern and reproductive success of S. latifolia plants in a natural population nearby and applied similar methodology. Here the negative effects of female flower densities occurred at finer scales and gave way to positive effects above 2 m, contrasting with some patterns from the experiment. Synthesis. In a sessile population interacting with mobile biota, the effects of density on individual fitness may vary with the way in which density is measured. This, together with the methodological challenges for analysing spatial data from continuous populations, should be considered when designing and interpreting studies of spatial density-dependence. Taking these issues into account, we may begin to explain the spatial patterns of natural populations.},

External threats such as invasive species and landscape characteristics such as isolation may impinge on both pollination and seed predation dynamics, which in turn can strongly affect reproduction. I assessed how patterns in floral visitation, seed predation, invasive ant presence, and plant isolation influenced one another and ultimately affected viable seed production in Haleakala silverswords (Argyroxiphium sandwicense subsp. macrocephalum) of Hawai'i. Floral visitation was dominated by endemic Hylaeus bees, and patterns of visitation were influenced by floral display size and number of plants clustered together, but not by floral herbivory or nearest flowering neighbor distance. There was also some indication that Argentine ant presence impacted floral visitation, but contradictory evidence and limitations of the study design make this result uncertain. Degree of seed predation was associated only with plant isolation, with the two main herbivores partitioning resources such that one preferentially attacked isolated plants while the other attacked clumped plants; total seed predation was greater in more isolated plants. Net viable seed production was highly variable among individuals (0-55\% seed set), and was affected mainly by nearest neighbor distance, apparently owing to low cross-pollination among plants separated by even short distances ({\textgreater} 10-20 m). This isolation effect dominated net seed set, with no apparent influence from floral visitation rates, percent seed predation, or invasive ant presence. The measured steep decline in seed set with isolation distance may not be typical of the entire silversword range, and may indicate that pollinators in addition to Hylaeus bees could be important for greater gene flow. Management aimed at maintaining or maximizing silversword reproduction should focus on the spatial context of field populations and outplanting efforts, as well as on conserving the widest possible range of pollinator taxa.},

Here we analysed an intraguild predator-prey system of two seabird species at a large spatio-temporal scale. As expected, we found that fecundity of prey was negatively affected by predator density. Nevertheless, fecundity of prey also increased nonlinearly with its own density and strikingly with the prey-predator ratio. Small groups of prey were probably not able to defend their nests especially against large number of predators. At the highest prey densities (i.e. when anti-predator strategies should be most efficient), prey fecundity also lowered, suggesting the appearance of density dependence mediated by food competition. Allee effects and density dependence occurred across a broad range of population sizes of both the prey and the predator at several local populations facing different ecological environments.},

Extinction risk was primarily driven by high market value, compounded by accessibility and familiarity (well known) in the marketplace. Extinction risk in marine animals often relates closely to body size and small geographical range but our study shows a clear exception. Conservation must not lose sight of common species, especially those of high value. Greater human population density and poorer economies in the geographical ranges of endangered species illustrate that anthropogenic variables can also predict extinction risks in marine animals.

	abstract = {I investigated reproduction in a three-year study of Echinacea augustifolia, purple coneflower, growing in a fragmented prairie landscape. I quantified the local abundance of flowering conspecifics at individual-based spatial scales and at a population-based spatial scale. Regression analyses revealed that pollen limitation increased while seed set and fecundity decreased with isolation of individual plants. Isolation, defined as the distance to the kth nearest flowering conspecific, was a good predictor of pollen limitation, for all nearest neighbors considered (k = 1-33), but the strength of the relationship, as quantified by R-2, peaked at intermediate scales (k = 2-18). The relationship of isolation to seed set and fecundity was similarly strongest at intermediate scales (k = 3-4). The scale dependence of individual density effects on reproduction (density of flowering plants within x meters) resembled that of isolation. Analyses at a population-based scale showed that pollen limitation declined significantly with population size. Seed set and fecundity also declined with population size, but significantly so only in 1998. Whether quantifying local abundance with population- or individual-based measures, reproductive failure due to pollen limitation is a consistent consequence of Echinacea scarcity. However, individual-based measures of local abundance predicted pollen limitation from a wider sample of plants with a simpler model than did Population size. Specifically, the largest site, a nature preserve, is composed of plants with intermediate individual isolation and, as predicted, intermediate pollen limitation, but its large population size poorly predicted population mean pollen limitation.},

Arbitrary assumptions regarding Allee effects could lead to erroneous management decisions so that predictive modelling approaches are needed that identify the circumstances leading to an Allee effect before such a scenario occurs. We present a predictive approach of Allee effects for polar bears where low population densities, an unpredictable habitat and harvest-depleted male populations result in infrequent mating encounters. We develop a mechanistic model for the polar bear mating system that predicts the proportion of fertilized females at the end of the mating season given population density and operational sex ratio. The model is parametrized using pairing data from Lancaster Sound, Canada, and describes the observed pairing dynamics well. Female mating success is shown to be a nonlinear function of the operational sex ratio, so that a sudden and rapid reproductive collapse could occur if males are severely depleted. The operational sex ratio where an Allee effect is expected is dependent on population density. We focus on the prediction of Allee effects in polar bears but our approach is also applicable to other species.},

This study provides the first assessment of the impact of macro-scale factors on the effectiveness of within-farm management on biodiversity, using spiders in Japan as an example. A multilevel modelling approach revealed that reducing pesticide applications increases spider abundance, particularly in areas with high precipitation, which were also associated with high potential spider abundance. Using the model we identified areas throughout Japan that can potentially benefit from organic farming. The alteration of local habitat-abundance relations by macro-scale factors could explain the reported low spatial generality in the effects of organic farming and patterns of habitat association.},

Turnover was estimated from the dilution of a 15N label introduced into consumer tissues by feeding on 15N-enriched periphyton. Muscle turnover rates were rapid (0.5-3.8\% per day), and were attributable to metabolic replacement of N as well as growth in catfish and snails. N turnover in catfish muscle decreased with size, and fin tissue turned over more rapidly than whole blood or muscle, though the difference was not significant. Our results indicate that stable isotope signatures of these tropical species could change markedly within weeks following a shift in diet. However, generalization across taxa or latitudes is complicated by the strong size-dependence of isotope turnover rates. The enrichment-dilution approach outlined here may facilitate measurement of isotopic turnover in a wide variety of consumers under field conditions.},

Spiders, aquatic and terrestrial prey, and basal resources of forest and stream food webs were collected in a deciduous forest along a Japanese headwater stream during May and July 2001. The delta(13)C analyses suggested that riparian tetragnathid spiders relied on aquatic insects and that the monthly variation of such dependence is partly associated with the seasonal dynamics of aquatic insect abundance in the riparian forest. Similarly, linyphiid spiders in the riparian forest exhibited delta(13)C values similar to aquatic prey in May. However, their delta(13)C values were close to terrestrial prey in both riparian and upland (150 m away from the stream) forests during June to July, suggesting the seasonal incorporation of stream-derived carbon into their tissue. In contrast, araneid spiders relied on terrestrial prey in both riparian and upland forests throughout the study period. These isotopic results were consistent with a previous study that reported seasonal variation in the aquatic prey contribution to total web contents for each spider group in this forest, implying that spiders assimilate trapped prey and that aquatic insect flux indeed contributes to the energetics of riparian tetragnathid and linyphiid spiders.},

For practical deer population control, deer population dynamics and the factors that influence them need to be evaluated in low-cost and time-efficient ways. However, in traditional methods of estimation, such as cohort analysis, large numbers of deer need to be caught for many years, and the ages of the deer must be determined. We estimated deer population dynamics by using a Bayesian state-space model with multiple deer abundance indices (seen deer per unit effort, pellet group count, and block count) and numbers of deer hunted and culled in Yamanashi Prefecture, central Japan. In the state process of our state-space model, latent deer abundance at year t in location m (Dt,m), with m being each cell of a grid mesh covering Yamanashi Prefecture, was assumed to decrease annually through hunting and culling, to increase with the population growth rate of each mesh (rm; which was determined from the percentages of forest, evergreen forest, and artificial grassland), and to fluctuate stochastically. In the observation process, Dt,m was assumed to be correlated with the deer abundance indices and a Gaussian white noise in the deer abundance indices. The estimated Dt,m was correlated with each deer abundance index, but the correlation coefficient was the greatest for pellet group density. The percentage of hunted and culled deer needed to reach 30\% to reduce the annual growth rate (Dt,m/Dt-1,m). Increasing the percentage of artificial grassland increased rm. Our results showed that 1) deer abundance could be estimated by using only deer abundance indices in addition to population growth rate and the percentage of hunted and culled deer; and 2) preventing the intrusion of deer onto artificial grassland and intensive culling on artificial grassland were important to decrease deer abundance.

The objective of our study was to determine the importance of unionid mussel-derived nitrogen (MDN) to the food web. We used a stable isotope tracer approach in conjunction with nutrient uptake and excretion experiments. We fed mussels (Lampsilis siliquiodea, n = 249) a N-15-enriched algal diet and placed them into a N-limited stream for 63 days. Mussel hemolymph was non-lethally sampled over the course of the experiment to measure tissue turnover of delta N-15 and excretion experiments were done to model the amount of N mussels provided in comparison to stream N uptake demand. Multiple food web pools were sampled twice prior and five times following the mussel addition to trace the N-15 through the food web. Our mussel excretion rates in comparison to areal uptake demand suggested that mussel excretion can account for 40\% of the total N demand in this stream. Our enrichment showed that MDN was entering the food web and supplied up to 19\% of the N in specific compartments of the food web near the mussel bed. When scaled to a natural mussel aggregation, our results suggest up to 74\% of N in the food web may be mussel-derived. Our results show that N supplied by mussels can be an important nutrient subsidy that provides food web support.},

Contributions of pelagic (p) and littoral (q) signatures of delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes were detected in fish muscular tissue by applying a dynamic baseline mixing model. This model integrates tissue-specific metabolic turnover (m) and fish growth (k) rates over baselines delta C-13 seasonality. Annual fluctuations for both pelagic and littoral baselines were not negligible (Delta C = 10\% and 8\%, respectively). We calculated that they could not be ignored, since contributions of pelagic and littoral signatures would be largely underestimated (up to 30\% p and 13\% q for whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) and roach (Rutilus rutilus), respectively). When fish relied upon pelagic consumers, stepwise N-15-enrichment (E) of pelagic preys linearly decreased with prey-size-specific predation pressure. Therefore, longer food webs would be proportionally less stepwise N-15-enriched than shorter ones.},

	abstract = {We previously found that males of two anuran species - Hyla versicolor and Rana clamitans - alter their mating calls in response to traffic noise. To test whether these alterations compensate for an effect of traffic noise on mate attraction, we (1) recorded a male calling at a quiet site; (2) played traffic noise at the same male and recorded its altered call; (3) used these recordings to attract females to a trap at sites either with or without broadcast traffic noise. The calls produced without traffic noise attracted fewer females when they were played at sites with traffic noise than when they were played at sites without noise. However, the calls of the same individuals produced with traffic noise attracted as many females at sites with noise as at sites without noise, and they attracted as many females as did the call of the same male made without noise and played at sites without noise (the natural' situation). Therefore, for these species, traffic noise does not affect mate attraction; males change their calls to compensate for a potential effect of traffic noise on mate attraction. A third species - Bufo americanus - does not alter its call in response to traffic noise, and its call made in the absence or presence of traffic noise was equally able to attract females in the absence or presence of traffic noise, indicating that traffic noise does not negatively affect mate attraction. Therefore, it appears that traffic noise does not negatively affect mate attraction in these three species of anurans. We suggest that, if our results apply to anurans in general, the previously documented negative effects of roads on anuran populations are likely caused mainly by road mortality. If this is true, road mitigation for anurans should focus mainly on reducing this mortality.},

Although it is a fundamental prediction of signal detection theory that noise should reduce both detection and discrimination of signals, little is known about these effects in animal communication. Female treefrogs, Hyla ebraccata, in Costa Rica choose mates in large noisy multispecies choruses. We tested gravid females for preferences between computer-synthesized calls with carrier frequencies of 3240 and 2960 Hz (values near the mode and the fifth percentile of the population, respectively) in four levels of background noise from a natural chorus. In the absence of noise (signal/noise ratio {\textgreater}25 dB), females preferred the lower frequency. With moderate signal/noise ratios (6 and 9 dB), they did not discriminate between these frequencies. With low signal/noise ratios (3 dB), females preferred the frequency near the mode for the population. Similar experiments had previously demonstrated that females can detect the presence of a male's calls with signal/noise ratios of 3 dB or greater. Thus moderate levels of natural background sound reduced a female's ability to discriminate between males' calls even when she could detect them. In high levels of background sound, females abandoned discrimination for low-frequency calls and reverted to the task of detecting signals with modal properties for the population. These results justify recent theoretical analyses of the importance of receivers' errors in the evolution of communication. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

	abstract = {Flume experiments were carried out to examine whether larval blackflies (Simulium ornatum complex, Diptera: Simuliidae) use microhabitats with a high-velocity current to reduce the fisk of predation by some of their main predators, viz. larvae of the stoneflies Isoperla grammatica and Diura nanseni (Plecoptera: Perlodidae), and the caddis-fly Rhyacophila nubila (Trichoptera: Rhyacophilidae). We exposed blackfly larvae to four different current velocities and measured their feeding rate using dye particles. The maximum feeding rate was recorded at intermediate velocities (18.8 and 36.2 cm/s), whereas at low (7.3 cm/s) and high (53.3 cm/s) velocities, the feeding rate was reduced. In separate experiments, we investigated the behaviour and attack success of the different predator species. The two perlodids showed a similar hunting behaviour, which was significantly less successful at higher velocities. Drift lf the perlodids from the experimental arena resulted in reduced encounter and attack rates, especially in I. grammatica, which had completely lost efficiency at 36.2 cm/s. R. nubila had a slower mode of hunting and was unaffected by current speed within the velocity gradient studied. Drift in Rhyacophila was rare. Observations on the behaviour of blackfly larvae were performed in the same experiments. The larvae showed no apparent ability to sense the presence of the predators except when these disrupted the flow pattern or were in physical contact, which often resulted in aggressive defence, though without effect on the predators. Escape of blackfly larvae by drift did occur, but this was no more common than being captured. In a current velocity gradient, blackfly larvae showed a weak preference for increasing velocities. Thus, at velocities between 7 and 54 cm/s, blackfly larvae appear to select microhabitats with high current velocities, despite a reduction in feeding optimality, thereby easing the predation impact from perlodids, though not from Rhyacophila. The study demonstrates the importance of microhabitat selection by blackfly larvae both for efficient feeding and predator avoidance.},

Ingestion rates of all three species increased with current velocity by a factor of 2.5 (P. mixtum/fuscum) to 10 (S. tuberosum) between 25 and 100 cm.s(-1). Measured field rates were significantly correlated with those predicted for similar larval sizes, temperatures, and seston concentrations in gutters, although field rates were only 56-87\% of those in gutters once corrected for differences in current velocity. These results suggest that the preference of these species for current velocities of about 100 cm.s(-1) reflect their ability to feed faster at these velocities. The effectiveness of larvicides can therefore be strongly affected by current velocities, and determinations of effective doses from gutter experiments may slightly underestimate the required quantity of larvicide.},

	abstract = {How should males respond to sexual rivals? We found evidence that male crickets increase their courtship calling effort when competing with a rival, but relax when their rival dies. Also, competing males died sooner than those that were free to court without a rival. These results highlight the importance of behavioral changes in courtship by males to life history strategies.Temporal variation in the strength of selection on male sexual traits is often attributable to changes in the social environment that alter the number of competitors. Selection could favor phenotypic plasticity in male investment into sexual traits if there are cues indicative of current and, possibly, future levels of mating competition. In many taxa, males court more intensely when rivals are present, but the extent to which phenotypically plastic responses differ predictably among males is less well studied. For example, will larger males show a greater or smaller change in courtship in response to the presence of rivals? In addition, the effects of any changes in courtship on key life-history traits have been understudied. In this study, we experimentally tested male crickets (Teleogryllus commodus) from 3 populations to determine how the presence or absence of a rival affects: 1) calling effort, 2) life span, and 3) whether male body size (correlated with dominance) influences any changes in life span or calling effort. Calling effort increased significantly with body size, mainly due to daily calling effort increasing with age and larger males living longer. Considering all males, there was no effect of rival presence on lifetime calling effort. However, within the rival present treatment, after correcting for age, the longer lived of 2 paired males called significantly more before his rival died than afterwards. This implies that there is a plastic shift in courtship effort. Finally, larger males lived significantly longer and, crucially, males housed with a rival had, on average, a significantly shorter life span.},

We explore the possibility that spatial or temporal heterogeneity in environmental signalling conditions (in this case light spectrum) may induce fluctuating sexual selection on male behaviour and ornamentation in guppies. We used shade cloth and filters to experimentally manipulate light spectrum, mimicking conditions found naturally: early morning/late afternoon light (SC treatment), midday forest shade (F89 filter treatment) and midday woodland shade (F55 filter treatment). Females were more responsive to male courtship and males were less likely to attempt sneak copulations under F55 light than the other two treatments. By contrast, male display rate was not influenced by treatment. Females tended to prefer the same males under SC and F55 light, but attractiveness in these treatments was unrelated to attractiveness under F89 light. There were similarities among treatments in the traits that females preferred: females preferred males with larger areas of orange in all three treatments. There were, however, also some differences, including preference for larger males under F89 light and for smaller males under the other treatments. Overall, the influence of ambient light spectrum on the relative importance of mate choice and male sneak copulation may have important implications for the mode and strength of sexual selection in different environments. The findings on attractiveness and preference functions, however, suggest that light spectrum only weakly affects the direction of sexual selection by female choice.},

	abstract = {Population regulation has been related to differences in the quality among habitats, which mediate differences in vital rates such that in poor habitats reproductive rates are lower than those in high-quality habitats. The spatial distribution of animals in such habitats depends on their preferences and the degree to which individuals have a free choice of a particular habitat. The identified mechanisms that lead to a particular spatial distribution and eventually to regulation mainly include foraging-related interference, for example, ideal free distribution, or simple selection of available high-quality habitats, that is, site-dependent habitat selection. However, in insect species these mechanisms might not be applicable, but density-dependent habitat selection still occurs. We therefore suggest a mechanism that refers to the nearly universal observation that matings also bear fitness costs. Although these costs have been investigated on the individual level in many insect species, their consequences for population dynamics have not yet been addressed. In the grasshopper species Stenobothrus lineatus, females in a nonreceptive mating status escape sexually approaching males by undirected jumps. By including such avoidance behavior in a spatially-explicit simulation model, we investigated its potential to result in progressive use of low-quality habitats at increasing population densities. In particular, we show that (1) such behavior changes habitat selection, (2) altered habitat selection results in population regulation, and (3) the degree of habitat heterogeneity influences regulation such that (4) heterogeneous habitats show fine-tuned regulation and homogeneous habitats tend to support large fluctuations.},

Here, we used Murgantia histrionica (Hahn) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), a herbivorous insect, to determine mating preferences and success using mating assays and preferences based on odor cues. We manipulated the natal and encounter contexts using two different host plants, mustard and broccoli. We found that both the natal host plant and the host plant where insects encountered potential mates significantly affected mating success in this insect. Broccoli-reared individuals were more likely to mate in general; however, all individuals were more likely to mate when placed in an encounter context of mustard. Using a separate assay, we also found that the natal host plant affected female preference based on odor cues; females preferred the odors of males from the same natal environment that the females experienced as nymphs. In addition, we examined color and body size for host plant effects as both size and color are important factors for many species during mate choice. We found that individuals reared on mustard were larger than those reared on broccoli. However, the proportion of orange color on the dorsum of insects was not significantly affected by the natal host plant. In summary, these results suggest that changes in host plants, as commonly occurs seasonally, may have implications for sexual selection via mate choice.},

We reared males on Opuntia humifusa (Raf.) (Cactaceae) cactus pads with and without cactus fruit. We found that females preferred the odour of males that had developed on cactus fruit over males that developed only on cactus pads. However, the current cactus context also affected female preference. Females were more likely to choose males that developed with cactus fruit when cactus fruit was currently available.

Such stresses are typically studied in isolation, but multiple stressors can combine in unexpected ways to alter the structure of ecological systems. Here, we experimentally explore the impacts of inorganic nutrients and organic matter on a range of food web properties. We find that these two stressors combine additively to produce significant increases in connectance and mean food chain length. Such increases are typically associated with enhanced robustness to secondary extinctions and productivity, respectively. Despite these apparent beneficial effects, we find a simplification of web structure in terms of taxon richness and diversity, and altered proportions of basal and top species. These effects are driven by a reduction in community assembly and lower consistency in a range of system properties as a result of the multiple stressors. Consequently, impacted food webs are likely to be more vulnerable to human- or climate-induced perturbations in the long term.},

Partnered observations conducted in regions of this atoll where native trees have been replaced by human propagated palms reveal that this complex interaction chain linking trees to mantas readily breaks down.

Two factors expected to explain variation in food chain length are resource availability (productivity) and environmental stress. We examined the impact of anthropogenic activities, both a source of stress and productivity, on lotic food webs using two simple food web descriptors based on stable nitrogen isotopes (delta 15N). We used 1) trophic position of small fish and 2) slopes of delta 15N-size class relationships in the invertebrate community as variables related to food chain length. Trophic positions and delta 15N-size slopes changed significantly across the 23 study sites selected to vary in productivity and impact from industrial activities (trophic position=0.4 to 1.9; slopes=-1 to +2.8). Fish trophic position was not affected by productivity (chlorophyll a) or environmental stress (number of factories on the watershed) and was not modulated by the proportion of predatory invertebrates in the food web leading to fish. This lack of relationship suggests that variation in trophic position is likely influenced by fish feeding behaviour and is therefore not a good integrator of changes in food chain length induced by anthropogenic activities. delta 15N-size slopes significantly increased with productivity and decreased with stress, suggesting that trophic organization by size within invertebrate communities is affected by these factors. These slopes also tended to be greater when the proportion of predators in the community increased in larger size classes. These results suggest that when productivity is high and stress is low, proportions of higher delta 15N-value predators in lotic food webs tend to increase, contributing to the lengthening of food chains. They also suggest that delta 15N-size relationships of invertebrate communities may be used as indicators of food web structure alteration by human activities.},

Widespread and intensifying anthropogenic disturbance threatens to disrupt trophic organisation by altering species composition and relative abundances and by driving shifts in the trophic ecology of species that persist in disturbed ecosystems. We examined how intensive disturbance caused by selective logging affects trophic organisation in the biodiversity hotspot of Sabah, Borneo. Using stable nitrogen isotopes, we quantified the positions in the food web of 159 leaf-litter ant species in unlogged and logged rainforest and tested four predictions: (i) there is a negative relationship between the trophic position of a species in unlogged forest and its change in abundance following logging, (ii) the trophic positions of species are altered by logging, (iii) disturbance alters the frequency distribution of trophic positions within the ant assemblage, and (iv) disturbance reduces food chain length. We found that ant abundance was 30\% lower in logged forest than in unlogged forest but changes in abundance of individual species were not related to trophic position, providing no support for prediction (i). However, trophic positions of individual species were significantly higher in logged forest, supporting prediction (ii). Consequently, the frequency distribution of trophic positions differed significantly between unlogged and logged forest, supporting prediction (iii), and food chains were 0.2 trophic levels longer in logged forest, the opposite of prediction (iv). Our results demonstrate that disturbance can alter trophic organisation even without trophically-biased changes in community composition. Nonetheless, the absence of any reduction in food chain length in logged forest suggests that species-rich arthropod food webs do not experience trophic downgrading or a related collapse in trophic organisation despite the disturbance caused by logging. These food webs appear able to bend without breaking in the face of some forms of anthropogenic disturbance.},

	abstract = {Larval black flies often exhibit spatially aggregated distributions, and individuals within patches can potentially reduce the supply of suspended food particles to downstream neighbors by modifying local flow characteristics. We used hot-film anemometry to quantify the magnitude and spatial extent of flow modifications downstream from feeding Simulium vittatum larvae in a laboratory flume, and to determine whether temporal patterns of flow variation are related to movements of the larval feeding appendages. Mean velocity 1 mm downstream from feeding larvae was reduced by 75\%, and the percent reduction in velocity diminished asymptotically with downstream distance. Reduced velocities were evident as much as 60 mm downstream from, and 3 mm to either side of, larvae. Turbulence intensity (i.e., the SD of the velocity time series) was generally higher in this region relative to control flow conditions. Three results demonstrate the major contribution of the larval feeding appendages (i.e., labral fans) to such flow modification. First, there was a minimal reduction in mean velocity 5 mm downstream from non-feeding larvae (i.e., with closed labral fans), whereas mean velocity at the same location was reduced markedly when larvae were feeding. Second, the power spectrum of the velocity time series exhibited greatest power at frequencies that corresponded to the frequency of labral fan motions. Third, fan flick times accounted for most of the variance in the velocity power spectrum. The large local flow modifications that we documented have potentially important consequences for the feeding performance and growth of individuals located within larval aggregations, and are likely to influence behavioral interactions and spacing patterns.},

	abstract = {While the recent inclusion of parasites into food-web studies has highlighted the role of parasites as consumers, there is accumulating evidence that parasites can also serve as prey for predators. Here we investigated empirical patterns of predation on parasites and their relationships with parasite transmission in eight topological food webs representing marine and freshwater ecosystems. Within each food web, we examined links in the typical predator-prey sub web as well as the predator-parasite sub web, i.e. the quadrant of the food web indicating which predators eat parasites. Most predator- parasite links represented concomitant predation' (consumption and death of a parasite along with the prey/host; 58-72\%), followed by trophic transmission' (predator feeds on infected prey and becomes infected; 8-32\%) and predation on free-living parasite life-cycle stages (4-30\%). Parasite life-cycle stages had, on average, between 4.2 and 14.2 predators. Among the food webs, as predator richness increased, the number of links exploited by trophically transmitted parasites increased at about the same rate as did the number of links where these stages serve as prey. On the whole, our analyses suggest that predation on parasites has important consequences for both predators and parasites, and food web structure. Because our analysis is solely based on topological webs, determining the strength of these interactions is a promising avenue for future research.},

In aquatic systems, many taxa consume free-living stages of parasites, and can thus reduce parasite transmission to hosts. However, the importance of the functional and numerical responses of parasite predators to disease dynamics is not well understood. We collected host-parasite-predator cooccurrence data from the field, and then experimentally manipulated predator abundance, parasite abundance, and the presence of alternative prey to determine the consequences for parasite transmission. The parasite predator of interest was a ubiquitous symbiotic oligochaete of mollusks, Chaetogaster limnaei limnaei, which inhabits host shells and consumes larval trematode parasites. Predators exhibited a rapid numerical response, where predator populations increased or decreased by as much as 60\% in just 5days, depending on the parasite:predator ratio. Furthermore, snail infection decreased substantially with increasing parasite predator densities, where the highest predator densities reduced infection by up to 89\%. Predators of parasites can play an important role in regulating parasite transmission, even when infection risk is high, and especially when predators can rapidly respond numerically to resource pulses. We suggest that these types of interactions might have cascading effects on entire disease systems, and emphasize the importance of considering disease dynamics at the community level.},

The present literature shows a broad range of impacts of infectious agents on food webs, and by cataloguing that range, we worked towards defining the various mechanisms and their specific effects. To explore the impact, a direct approach is to study changes in food-web properties with infectious agents as separate species in the web, acting as additional nodes, with links to their host species. An indirect approach concentrates not on adding new nodes and links, but on the ways that infectious agents affect the existing links across host and non-host nodes, by influencing the 'quality' of consumer-resource interaction as it depends on the epidemiological state host involved. Both approaches are natural from an ecological point of view, but the indirect approach may connect more straightforwardly to commonly used tools in infectious disease dynamics.},

	abstract = {Trophic linkages between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are increasingly recognized as.important yet poorly known features of food webs. Here we describe research to understand the dynamics of lake food webs in relation to a native riparian amphibian and its interaction with introduced trout. The mountain yellow-legged frog Rana muscosa is endemic to alpine watersheds of the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Transverse Ranges of California, but it has declined to a small fraction of its historical distribution and abundance. Although remaining frogs and introduced trout feed in different habitats of alpine lakes, our stable-isotope analyses clearly show that the same resource base of benthic invertebrates sustains their growth. During one period, insect emergence from naturally fishless lakes was nearly 20-fold higher compared to adjacent lakes with trout, showing that fish reduce availability of aquatic prey to amphibious and terrestrial consumers. Although trout cannot prey on adult frogs due to gape limitation, foraging post-metamorphic frogs are 10 times more abundant in the absence of trout, suggesting an important role for competition for prey by trout in highly unproductive alpine watersheds. Most Sierran lakes contain fish, and those that do not are usually small isolated ponds; in our study, these two lake types supported the lowest densities of post-metamorphic frogs, and these frogs were less reliant on local, benthic sources of productivity. Since Rana muscosa was formerly the most abundant vertebrate in the Sierra Nevada, the reduction in energy flow from lake benthos to this consumer due to fish introductions may have had negative consequences for its numerous terrestrial predators, many of which have also declined. We suggest that disruptions of trophic connections between aquatic and terrestrial food webs are an important but poorly understood consequence of fish introduction to many thousands of montane lakes and streams worldwide and may contribute to declines of native consumers in riparian habitats.},

	abstract = {The magnitude of cross-ecosystem resource subsidies is increasingly well recognized; however, less is known about the distance these subsidies travel into the recipient landscape. In streams and rivers, this distance can delimit the biological stream width, complementary to hydro-geomorphic measures (e.g., channel banks) that have typically defined stream ecosystem boundaries. In this study we used meta-analysis to define a stream signature on land that relates the stream-to-land subsidy to distance. The 50\% stream signature, for example, identifies the point on the landscape where subsidy resources are still at half of their maximum (in- or near-stream) level. The decay curve for these data was best fit by a negative power function in which the 50\% stream signature was concentrated near stream banks (1.5 m), but a non-trivial (10\%) portion of the maximum subsidy level was still found {\textgreater}0.5 km from the water's edge. The meta-analysis also identified explanatory variables that affect the stream signature. This improves our understanding of ecosystem conditions that permit spatially extensive subsidy transmission, such as in highly productive, middle-order streams and rivers. Resultant multivariate models from this analysis may be useful to managers implementing buffer rules and conservation strategies for stream and riparian function, as they facilitate prediction of the extent of subsidies. Our results stress that much of the subsidy remains near the stream, but also that subsidies (and aquatic organisms) are capable of long-distance dispersal into adjacent environments, and that the effective biological stream width of stream and river ecosystems is often much larger than has been defined by hydro-geomorphic metrics alone. Limited data available from marine and lake sources overlap well with the stream signature data, indicating that the signature approach may also be applicable to subsidy spatial dynamics across other ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Metacommunity theory suggests that relationships between diversity and ecosystem stability can be determined by the rate of species dispersal among local communities. The predicted relationships, however, may depend upon the relative strength of local environmental processes and disturbance. Here we evaluate the role of dispersal frequency and local predation perturbations in affecting patterns of diversity and stability in pond plankton metacommunities. Pond metacommunities were composed of three mesocosm communities: one of the three communities maintained constant "press'' predation from a selective predator, bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus); the second community maintained "press'' conditions without predation; and the third community experienced recurrent "pulsed'' predation from bluegill sunfish. The triads of pond communities were connected at either no, low (0.7\%/d), or high (20\%/d) planktonic dispersal. Richness and composition of zooplankton and stability of plankton biomass and ecosystem productivity were measured at local and regional spatial scales. Dispersal significantly affected diversity such that local and regional biotas at the low dispersal rate maintained the greatest number of species. The unimodal local dispersal-diversity relationship was predator-dependent, however, as selective press predation excluded species regardless of dispersal. Further, there was no effect of dispersal on beta diversity because predation generated local conditions that selected for distinct community assemblages. Spatial and temporal ecosystem stability responded to dispersal frequency but not predation. Low dispersal destabilized the spatial stability of producer biomass but stabilized temporal ecosystem productivity. The results indicate that selective predation can prevent species augmentation from mass effects but has no apparent influence on stability. Dispersal rates, in contrast, can have significant effects on both species diversity and ecosystem stability at multiple spatial scales in metacommunities.},

	abstract = {The spatial scale of similarity among fish communities is characteristically large in temperate marine systems: connectivity is enhanced by high rates of dispersal during the larval/juvenile stages and the increased mobility of large-bodied fish. A larger spatial scale of similarity (low beta diversity) is advantageous in heavily exploited systems because locally depleted populations are more likely to be "rescued" by neighboring areas. We explored whether the spatial scale of similarity changed from 1970 to 2006 due to overfishing of dominant, large-bodied groundfish across a 300 000-km(2) region of the Northwest Atlantic. Annually, similarities among communities decayed slowly with increasing geographic distance in this open system, but through time the decorrelation distance declined by 33\%, concomitant with widespread reductions in biomass, body size, and community evenness. The decline in connectivity stemmed from an erosion of community similarity among local subregions separated by distances as small as 100 km. Larger fish, of the same species, contribute proportionally more viable offspring, so observed body size reductions will have affected maternal output. The cumulative effect of nonlinear maternal influences on egg/larval quality may have compromised the spatial scale of effective larval dispersal, which may account for the delayed recovery of certain member species. Our study adds strong support for using the spatial scale of similarity as an indicator of metacommunity stability both to understand the spatial impacts of exploitation and to refine how spatial structure is used in management plans.},

	abstract = {Ecological communities are impacted by anthropogenic changes in both habitat geometry (i.e. amount, shape, fragmentation and connectivity of habitat) and disturbance regime. Although the effect of each of these drivers on diversity is well-documented, few studies have considered how habitat geometry and disturbance interact to affect diversity. We used a miniature landscape of moss patches to experimentally manipulate both habitat geometry and disturbance frequency on microarthropod communities. Species richness and abundance in local patches declined linearly with disturbance rate in all experimental landscapes, but the speed of this decline (a measure of ecological resilience) depended on the size and connectivity of the surrounding region. Reductions in region size had little effect on community resilience to disturbance until habitat loss resulted in complete loss of connectivity between patches, suggesting a threshold in community response to habitat loss. Beyond this threshold, repeated disturbance resulted in rapid declines in patch species richness and abundance and substantial changes in community composition. These effects of habitat geometry and disturbance on diversity were scale-dependent. Gamma (regional-scale) diversity was unaffected by habitat geometry, suggesting experimental reductions in alpha (local-scale) diversity were offset by increases in beta diversity. There was no effect of body size, abundance, or trophic position in determining species response to disturbance. Taxonomic grouping had a weak effect, with oribatids less affected by drought. We conclude that, in this system, dispersal from the surrounding metacommunity is vital in allowing recovery of local communities from disturbance. When habitat loss and fragmentation disrupt this process, extinctions result. Studies that examine separately the effects of habitat alterations and disturbance on diversity may therefore underestimate their combined effects.},

Theory predicts that population size affects reproduction and, consequently, a population's expansion, but there are few empirical tests, and fewer that account for the reduced genetic diversity that often accompanies small population size. We created experimental small populations of invasive ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) with population size varying independently from genetic diversity. Treatment independence was achieved by cloning plants to increase population size without changing diversity. Plant fitness was measured as the proportion of florets producing a seed. We analyzed the effects of population size, genetic diversity, and their interaction using ANCOVAs, one of which accounted for variation in individual plant growth. As predicted, smaller populations produced significantly lower proportion seed set. Low genetic diversity also reduced seed set, but this was best interpreted as part of a significant interaction with population size. Specifically, the effect of population size on the proportion seed set was over five times larger for populations in the medium genetic diversity treatment than the highest diversity treatment, and 6.7 times larger for populations with the lowest level of diversity. Population size variation had biologically meaningful consequences, as the rate of seed set within the low diversity treatment increased by 80 \% with increasing population size. The results indicate that both the demographics and genetics of populations can influence reproduction and invasive potential, and must be considered when assessing risk and designing management plans for invasive plants.},

	abstract = {AimDendritic ecological networks (DENs), such as river systems, combine features that challenge the traditional conceptual views and empirical approaches applied to metacommunities. As a result of their dendritic branching geometry and stream flow directionality, they are strongly hierarchical and asymmetrical. We analysed the metacommunity structure of benthic diatoms in a large-scale river system with the aim of evaluating the importance of potential causal influences. Furthermore, we hypothesized that metacommunities of diatoms that are strongly attached to their substrata show a different spatial structure than metacommunities of other, more weakly attached diatoms. LocationThe study was carried out in the Dong River, a 32,275km(2) subtropical river network located in southern China. MethodsWe surveyed benthic diatom communities during three seasons (dry, intermediate and wet). Using partial redundancy analysis, we partitioned community variation among environmental models and different spatial eigenfunction models to evaluate the influence of alternative dispersal pathways (overland versus water course dispersal), stream directionality, man-made dams and diatom functional traits on diatom metacommunity structure. ResultsModels based on hydrological connections and water directionality represent spatial patterns better than overland distances, suggesting that the dynamics of benthic diatom metacommunities are mainly confined to the river network and influenced by the prevailing water flow. We found significant effects of man-made dams on the spatial structure of important limnological variables and diatom metacommunity structure. The metacommunity of strongly attached diatoms also showed a weaker signature of flow directionality than that of other growth forms, especially in seasons with high water levels. Main conclusionsWe conclude that the consideration of among-site connectivity, flow directionality and species traits is key to a better understanding of the spatial ecology of passively dispersing microbial organisms in river systems.},

Additionally, we hypothesized that fauna in the mainstream may be affected by drifting migrants from tributaries. In nine stream networks, we sampled a similar microhabitat immediately upstream and downstream of two confluences. In each network, one confluence was located in the network centre and one in the periphery, and they were distinguished by low and high ratios of tributary size, respectively. We assessed whether the aquatic fauna at sites downstream from confluences was species-richer, distinct in composition and structure, and whether it included the fauna of upstream sites. We found that richness, rarefied richness, and abundance at downstream sites were not higher than at their upstream counterparts. Faunas at downstream sites were not nested subsets of those at upstream sites. Macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and structure differed between downstream and upstream sites in the peripheral confluences (high tributary to mainstream (T:M) ratios), but not in central confluences (low T:M ratios). Thus, effects of small tributaries on receiving mainstreams are dependent on the T:M ratio.},

Using stability analysis, we derive a novel criterion for metapopulation persistence in arbitrarily complex landscapes described as spatial networks. We show how dendritic geometry and overland dispersal can promote population persistence, and that their synergism provides an explanation of the so-called `drift paradox'. We also study the geography of the initial spread of a species and place it in the context of biological invasions.

	doi = {10.1017/s0006323196005014},
	abstract = {The aim of this review is to consider variation in mating preferences among females. We define mating preferences as the sensory and behavioural properties that influence the propensity of individuals to mate with certain phenotypes. Two properties of mating preferences can be distinguished: (I) 'preference functions' - the order with which an individual ranks prospective mates and (2) 'choosiness' - the effort an individual is prepared to invest in mate assessment. Patterns of mate choices can be altered by changing the costs of choosiness without altering the preference function. We discuss why it is important to study variation in female mating behaviour and identify five main areas of interest: Variation in mating preferences and costs of choosiness could (I) influence the rate and direction of evolution by sexual selection, (2) provide information about the evolutionary history of female preferences, (3) help explain inter-specific differences in the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics, (4) provide information about the level of benefits gained from mate choice, (5) provide information about the underlying mechanisms of mate choice. Variation in mate choice could be due to variability in preference functions, degree of choosiness, or both, and may arise due to genetic differences, developmental trajectories or proximate environmental factors. We review the evidence for genetic variation from genetic studies of heritability and also from data on the repeatability of mate-choice decisions (which can provide information about the upper limits to heritability). There can be problems in interpreting patterns of mate choice in terms of variation in mating preferences and we illustrate two main points. First, some factors can lead to mate choice patterns that mimic heritable variation in preferences and secondly other factors may obscure heritable preferences. These factors are divided into three overlapping classes, environmental, social and the effect of the female phenotype. The environmental factors discussed include predation risk and the costs of sampling; the social factors discussed include the effect of male-male interactions as well as female competition. We review the literature which presents data on how females sample males and discuss the number of cues females use. We conclude that sexual-selection studies have paid far less attention to variation among females than to variation among males, and that there is still much to learn about how females choose males and why different females make different choices. We suggest a number of possible lines for future research.},

Less surveillance may allow greater population growth and spread prior to detection, thereby increasing the costs of damages and control. In addition, surveillance strategies are usually applied in environments under continual invasion pressure where the number, size and location of established populations are unknown prior to detection. We develop a novel modeling framework that accounts for these features of the decision and invasion environment and determines the long term sampling effort that minimises the total expected costs of new invasions. The optimal solution depends on population establishment and growth rates, sample sensitivity, and sample, eradication, and damage costs. We demonstrate how to optimise surveillance systems under budgetary constraints and find that accounting for spatial heterogeneity in sampling costs and establishment rates can greatly reduce management costs.},

Recent theory and experiments reveal that whether an interaction is beneficial or detrimental to the dynamics of a population often depends on species densities and other environmental factors. Here, we explore how, for suitable densities, facilitation may arise between two competing species with an Allee effect. We consider two different mechanisms for the Allee effect: 1) plant species with obligate insect pollination, and 2) generalist predation. In the first case, a second plant species, competing for nutrients, may have a facilitative effect by attracting more pollinators. In the second case, another potentially competing species may serve to satiate the same generalist predator and thereby have a facilitative effect. We explore three aspects of facilitation in each of the two systems. The focal species may benefit from the presence of a competitor' if it experiences 1) the removal of the Allee threshold, 2) a lowering of the Allee threshold, or 3) an increase in carrying capacity. We find that the latter two effects occur in both study systems whereas the first only occurs for the generalist predation system but not for the plant-pollination system. We give precise conditions on when such a facilitative effect can be expected. We also demonstrate several unexpected outcomes of these two-species interactions with multiple steady states, such as obligate co-occurence; we draw parallels to the dynamics of species known as ecosystem engineers', and we discuss implications for conservation and management.},

When individuals are reproductively mature for only a portion of a population's breeding season, reproductive asynchrony can cause mating failure and a temporal Allee effect, which is exacerbated by spatial constraints in isolated populations. However, the effect of phenological variation by sex (protandry, protogyny) in spatiotemporal mate finding is not well understood. Here, we examine the interacting roles of sex-specific and population-wide individual asynchrony on female matelessness in spatially isolated populations. By incorporating sex-specific phenology into a two-sex reaction-diffusion system, we explore female matelessness as a function of phenology, movement behavior, and patch size. Although individual asynchrony may lead to female mating failure in small and isolated populations, we find that moderate protandry reduces female mating failure across a variety of scenarios. We go on to examine model behavior for a case study based on the bagworm, Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformisHaworth (Lepidoptera: Psychidae), where many populations exhibit pronounced protogyny. Overall, we find a consistent benefit of moderate protandry, which may mitigate female matelessness for many populations.},

	abstract = {The recovery of depleted species depends on their population dynamics at low abundance. Classical population growth models, applied widely in fisheries science, assume that per capita offspring production increases as abundance declines (compensation). However, slow or absent recovery by many depleted fishes might reflect unexpectedly weak compensation or the presence of Allee effects (depensation). Using meta-analytical techniques to describe reproductive dynamics, we find considerable variability among 207 exploited marine fish stocks (104 species) in how standardized per capita population growth changes with abundance. Although many species exhibit strong compensatory dynamics (negative density dependence), others show much weaker compensation than expected, and some exhibit evidence of an Allee effect, such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Alaskan walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma). As data at low levels of abundance become increasingly available, it appears that compensation, while strong in some species, is comparatively weak or nonexistent in others, thus providing an explanation for why the recovery of some depleted stocks, despite reductions in exploitation, has been considerably less than what classic models of population growth would otherwise suggest.},

	abstract = {Increasing evidence shows that spatial interactions between sedentary organisms can structure communities and promote landscape complexity in many ecosystems. Here we tested the hypothesis that reef-forming mussels (Mytilus edulis L.), a dominant intertidal ecosystem engineer in the Wadden Sea, promote abundances of the burrowing bivalve Cerastoderma edule L. (cockle) in neighboring habitats at relatively long distances coastward from mussel beds. Field surveys within and around three mussel beds showed a peak in cockle densities at 50-100 m toward the coast from the mussel bed, while cockle abundances elsewhere in the study area were very low. Field transplantation of cockles showed higher survival of young cockles (2-3 years old) and increased spat fall coastward of the mussel bed compared to within the bed and to areas without mussels, whereas growth decreased within and coastward of the mussel bed. Our measurements suggest that the observed spatial patterns in cockle numbers resulted from (1) inhibition effects by the mussels close to the beds due to preemptive algal depletion and deteriorated sediment conditions and (2) facilitation effects by the mussels farther away from the beds due to reduction of wave energy. Our results imply that these spatial, scale-dependent interactions between reef-forming ecosystem engineers and surrounding communities of sedentary benthic organisms can be an important determinant of the large-scale community structure in intertidal ecosystems. Understanding this interplay between neighboring communities of sedentary species is therefore essential for effective conservation and restoration of soft-bottom intertidal communities.},

Little evidence either supporting or contradicting this assumption exists, despite the importance of seed production to population persistence and growth.

We also quantified pollen deposition rates on stigmas and pollen traps along a windward to leeward gradient. We found pollen impoverishment at the low-density leading edge of a large invasion, causing an 8-fold reduction in seed set. We found 9-fold more pollen on stigmas of high-density plants than on those of low-density plants. Pollen deposition rates on stigmas and traps did not increase downwind of low-density plants but did increase downwind of high-density plants and dropped off precipitously across a gap that lacked pollen donors. The delay of appreciable numbers of seed caused by pollen limitation persists for decades until vegetative growth coalesces plants into continuous meadows, and this Allee effect has slowed the rate of spread of the invasion.},

	abstract = {Species usually have to use indirect cues when assessing habitat quality. This means that it is possible for humans to alter habitats in a way that causes a discrepancy between the cues and the true quality of different habitats. This phenomenon is called an 'ecological trap'. Here we show that the trap may lead to a behaviourally mediated Allee effect, where population growth is reduced because of non-ideal choices of individuals. The reduction is greatest at low densities because more individuals can choose their preferred habitat when competition for breeding sites is reduced. An ecological trap may lead to multiple equilibria in population dynamics and cause deterministic extinction in habitats that are capable of sustaining a viable population. We also study the efficiency of three mechanisms that may rescue a population from this extinction trap: natural selection acting on habitat preferences and two forms of phenotypic plasticity, experience-based learning and a philopatric preference for the natal habitat. Selection is most efficient in short-lived species with large heritable variation in habitat preferences, whereas in long-lived species, plastic traits outperform genetically determined preferences. The simple philopatric strategy generally produces the most favourable outcome. It hardly differs from the optimal strategy that assumes perfect and immediate knowledge of habitat change, and is very robust to non-ideal variation in the strength of habitat preferences. We conclude that conservation biologists need to ensure that cues for habitat choice correlate with habitat quality.},

	abstract = {The exchange of native pathogens between wild and domesticated animals can lead to novel disease threats to wildlife. However, the dynamics of wild host-parasite systems exposed to a reservoir of domesticated hosts are not well understood. A simple mathematical model reveals that the spill-back of native parasites from domestic to wild hosts may cause a demographic Allee effect in the wild host population. A second model is tailored to the particulars of pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis), for which parasite spill-back is a conservation and fishery concern. In both models, parasite spill-back weakens the coupling of parasite and wild host abundanceparticularly at low host abundancecausing parasites per host to increase as a wild host population declines. These findings show that parasites shared across host populations have effects analogous to those of generalist predators and can similarly cause an unstable equilibrium in a focal host population that separates persistence and extirpation. Allee effects in wildlife arising from parasite spill-back are likely to be most pronounced in systems where the magnitude of transmission from domestic to wild host populations is high because of high parasite abundance in domestic hosts, prolonged sympatry of domestic and wild hosts, a high transmission coefficient for parasites, long-lived parasite larvae, and proximity of domesticated populations to wildlife migration corridors.},

	abstract = {In a single well-mixed population, equally abundant neutral alleles are equally likely to persist. However, in spatially complex populations structured by an asymmetric dispersal mechanism, such as a coastal population where larvae are predominantly moved downstream by currents, the eventual frequency of neutral haplotypes will depend on their initial spatial location. In our study of the progression of two spatially separate, genetically distinct introductions of the European green crab (Carcinus maenas) along the coast of eastern North America, we captured this process in action. We documented the shift of the genetic cline in this species over 8 y, and here we detail how the upstream haplotypes are beginning to dominate the system. This quantification of an evolving genetic boundary in a coastal system demonstrates that novel genetic alleles or haplotypes that arise or are introduced into upstream retention zones (regions whose export of larvae is not balanced by import from elsewhere) will increase in frequency in the entire system. This phenomenon should be widespread when there is asymmetrical dispersal, in the oceans or on land, suggesting that the upstream edge of a species' range can influence genetic diversity throughout its distribution. Efforts to protect the upstream edge of an asymmetrically dispersing species' range are vital to conserving genetic diversity in the species.},

These eight species had reproductive traits characteristic of large, outcrossing populations: hermaphrodites were rare, we found no evidence of protandry, and sex ratios were even or slightly male-biased. 3. Age at sexual maturity varied among species, ranging from {\textless}1 to 2 years for L. ornata to 3-9 years for Q. asperata. In all species, most mature females participated in reproduction and fertilisation success was high. 5. Fecundity was related positively to both length and age, but length was the best predictor. In six species, fecundity increased exponentially with increasing size; in two species the rate of increase in fecundity declined in larger animals. In four species, fecundity declined in older animals. These latter results indicate weak reproductive senescence; however, in all species, older individuals continued to produce large numbers of offspring. Mean annual fecundity differed widely among species ranging from 9647 to 325 709. Within-species differences in fecundity were found among rivers and among populations within a river. 6. The wide variation in reproductive traits among species indicates the existence of widely divergent life history strategies in freshwater mussels.},

	doi = {10.1111/fwb.12045},
	abstract = {1. Both local and regional processes simultaneously control species assemblages depending on spatial habitat configuration. In dendritic networks like streams, the unique spatial arrangement of habitats produces various combinations of local habitat size and isolation. Stream invertebrate assemblages could therefore be controlled by different combinations of local and regional processes, depending on their location in the network. 2. Using quantile regression, we investigated how local habitat size, local environmental conditions and spatial isolation influenced variation in assemblage composition. Adult Trichoptera and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were represented by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination scores, as were local environmental conditions, in four headwater stream networks in New Zealand. 3. With increasing local habitat size, there was a decrease in variation in assemblage composition (NMDS scores) of both adult Trichoptera and benthic macroinvertebrates. This relationship between habitat size and assemblage variation was related to local habitat conditions at the upper limit of assemblage variability and spatial isolation at the lower limit of assemblage variability, for both adult Trichoptera and benthic assemblages, indicating joint local and regional controls on stream invertebrate assemblages. 4. The relationships between local assemblages and their neighbours, based on community similarity scores, differed between benthic macroinvertebrates and adult Trichoptera. For benthic assemblages, the larger the stream, the more similar assemblages were to neighbouring assemblages, whereas there was no consistent relationship between assemblage similarity and stream size for adult Trichoptera. This difference in structuring could be attributed to contrasting spatial influences linked to the different dispersal modes of adults and larvae. However, because adult and benthic assemblages are not independent, the influence of life stage on spatial distribution is difficult to determine (i.e. it is essentially a chicken and egg argument). 5. Overall, our approach using quantile regression to evaluate limit responses, rather than regressions on means, has highlighted the joint importance of local habitat and spatial processes in structuring stream invertebrate assemblages. Furthermore, we have provided evidence for the importance of the spatial network arrangement and interactions between life stages and dispersal processes, in structuring stream assemblages.},

The delta C-13 values of G. japonica were similar to those of periphyton at each station, suggesting that G. japonica is a grazer on periphyton. A significant positive correlation between carbon isotope values of S. marmorata and benthic particulate organic matter ( BPOM) indicated that BPOM varied in composition according to the amount of solar energy within a reach. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between carbon isotope values of filter-feeders and the periphytic algal contribution to BPOM using an isotope mixing model, indicating that the main food source of the filter feeders was derived from the in situ periphytic algae in open reaches and from a terrestrial source in canopy-covered reaches.},

We estimated how drifting plankton from a reservoir contribute to downstream food webs and showed that they alter community structures over a 10-km reach below the dam. To estimate the contribution of the drifting plankton to macroinvertebrates, we used C and N isotopes and an IsoSource mixing model. In spring and autumn, contributions of plankton to collector-filterer species were highest 0.2 km downstream of the dam, and clearly decreased from 0.2 to 10 km. At 0.2 km, the contribution of plankton to a predator stonefly was remarkably high. These results indicated that drifting plankton from a dam reservoir could subsidize downstream food webs and alter their energy base, but the importance of this subsidy decreased as distance from the reservoir increased. The general linear models indicated that the abundance of collector-filterers and predators was related positively to zooplankton density in stream water. Thus, food source alteration by drifting plankton also influenced the community structures downstream of the dam.},

We investigated its fish hosts, efficacy of infestation methods, suitability of host populations, and population demographics. Fish were collected and infested with tan riffleshell glochidia to examine potential hosts. juveniles transformed on at least 5 of the tested species: fantail darter (Etheostoma flabellare), greenside darter (E. blennioides), redline darter (E. rufilineatum), snubnose darter (E. simoterum), and 1 or 2 cottids: banded sculpin (Cottus bairdi) or mottled sculpin (C. carolinae). Fantail darters from 4 drainages were collected and infested with glochidia to compare the suitability of various populations of the most successful host. The number of juvenile mussels obtained from fantail darters collected from Indian Creek ((x) over bar +/- 1 SD = 59.22 +/- 10.01) was significantly higher than those transformed on fantail darters from the Roanoke River ((x) over bar = 9.45 +/- 10.64), where the tan riffleshell. does not occur. Variation in transformation success supports the hypothesis that host fish suitability is mediated by varying immune responses, and that coadaptation of sympatric host fish and mussel populations seemingly enhances compatibility. No significant difference (ANOVA, p = 0.39) existed between the numbers of juvenile tan riffleshells produced by fish using 2 different infestation techniques. The population of tan riffleshells in Indian Creek was similar to 2000 adults using Schumacher's modification of Schnabel's maximum likelihood estimator. Sex ratio was near 1: 1, and size-frequency distributions of males and females were not significantly different.

	abstract = {1. This study attempts to determine the mechanisms by which the downstream displacement of lotic invertebrates is compensated by the upstream movements of immatures and adults. To this end, submerged and aerial traps were set up at three sites, each 100 m apart, on a small mountain stream (Yr Ogof) in North Wales and operated for 12 months. 2. At Site 1 (the source), 19.3\% of the benthic invertebrates lost as drift were replaced by the upstream movement of aquatic stages. At Site 2, the average upstream compensation was 51.1\% (although there was a marked difference between the two traps at the site). At downstream Site 3 the average compensation was 55.4\%. The net loss of benthos downstream over 1 year was estimated to be 261 920 individuals from Site 1, 41 891 from Site 2, and 40 470 from Site 3. 3. At Sites 1 and 2, the numbers of invertebrates drifting were positively correlated with both current speed and water depth. At Sites 2 and 3, the numbers moving upstream were positively correlated with water temperature. At all three sites, the numbers of animals drifting were positively correlated with the numbers moving upstream, under water. 4. In none of the eight common species of stonefly did females show a strong overall upstream flight preference - however, two species, Leuctra nigra and Nemoura erratica, showed a significant downstream preference. 5. As with the stonefly nymphs, most of the caddisfly larvae showed a longitudinal distribution. Agapetus fuscipes larvae were most abundant at Site 1, yet females showed no preferred flight direction - this would seem to be inappropriate for maintaining this larval distribution pattern. However, females caught moving upstream at Site 2 were bigger and contained twice as many eggs, which were also larger, than females moving upstream at Site 1. The flight patterns of the other Trichoptera also seemed inappropriate for maintaining their respective larval distributions. Immature insects moved upstream at certain sites and times, but trends were not consistent. There was no correlation between female flight direction and local wind speed and direction. 6. Downstream displacement of the most abundant non-insect species, Gammarus pulex, was quite considerable at all three sites. However, at several times during the year the numbers moving upstream approached or exceeded those drifting. Maintenance of benthic population densities in this species is thought to be through a combination of upstream movement (which was highly correlated with benthic density at Sites 1 and 3) and production of young over a long (10 month) reproductive period. Maintenance of the benthic populations of the immature stages of the majority of insect species in Yr Ogof is thought to be through oviposition by females in the vicinity of their emergence sites. 7. Differences in density, size of individuals and life history were found among sites for several benthic species. The concept of optimal larval habitat is discussed in the context of longitudinal zonation and the flight behaviour of ovipositing females.},

This 6-year study (2002-2007) assessed the effects of the timing and magnitude of spring flood events on year-class strength in sympatric Populations of fall-spawning brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, fall-spawning brown trout Salmo trutta. and spring-spawning rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. The relative abundances, of young-of-year (age-0) and age-1 fall- and spring-spawning salmonids were documented for 4 and 6 years in streams from two watersheds in the Catskill Mountains, New York. Fall-spawning age-0 fish dominated in all years except 2005. 111 spring 2005 it large flood occurred at nearly the same time of year as file 2004 snowmelt, but discharge wits nearly an order of magnitude greater. The dominant salmonid for that year-class shifted to rainbow trout, but fall-spawned age-0 trout were again dominant in the following year. These results indicate that the timing and magnitude of spring high flows can increase the relative abundance of spring-spawning age-0 salmonids, decrease the abundance of fall-spawning age-0 salmonids, or both. The overall dominance of fall-spawned fish appears to be resilient its long as displacing floods occur a few years apart.

	abstract = {Dispersal is a key process in metacommunity dynamics, allowing the maintenance of diversity in complex community networks. Geographic distance is usually used as a surrogate for connectivity implying that communities that are closely located are considered more prone to exchange individuals than distant communities. However, in some natural systems, organisms may be subjected to directional dispersal (air or water flows, particular landscape configuration), possibly leading close communities to be isolated from each other and distant communities to be connected. Using geographic distance as a proxy for realised connectivity may then yield misleading results regarding the role of dispersal in structuring communities in such systems. Here, we quantified the relative importance of flow connectivity, geographic distance, and environmental gradients to explain polychaete metacommunity structure along the coasts of the Gulf of Lions (northwest Mediterranean Sea). Flow connectivity was estimated by Lagrangian particle dispersal simulations. Our results revealed that this metacommunity is strongly structured by the environment at large spatial scales, and that both flow connectivity and geographic distance play an important role within homogeneous environments at smaller spatial scales. We thus strongly advocate for a wider use of connectivity measures, in addition to geographic distance, to study spatial patterns of biological diversity (e.g. distance decay) and to infer the processes behind these patterns at different spatial scales. Synthesis Everything is connected, but connections are seldom accurately quantified. Biological communities are often studied separately, using observations, experiments and models to unravel local dynamics of organisms interacting with each other. However, regional processes such as dispersal through ocean and air circulation, likely to connect distant communities and influence their local dynamics, are not always accounted for, or, at best, used as an homogeneous and distance-related factor. Ocean models have being extensively developed and validated during the past decades with the increasing availability of accurate meteorological data. Using such model outputs, precise quantifi cation of exchange rates of organisms between communities was performed in a marine Mediterranean coastal area. Jointly with local environmental and biological data, these results were used to quantify the effects of realistic connectivity on local and regional polychaete community structure, and revealed that the environmental gradient, geographic distance, and connectivity were responsible for community structure at different spatial scales.},

	abstract = {1. Freshwater ecosystems are amongst the most threatened and poorly protected globally. They continue to be degraded through habitat loss, pollution and invading species and conservation measures are urgently needed to halt declining trends in their biodiversity and integrity. 2. During the past decade a suite of decision support tools and computational approaches have been developed for efficient and targeted conservation action in terrestrial or marine ecosystems. These methods may be poorly suited for planning in freshwater systems because connectivity in terrestrial and marine systems is typically modelled in a way unsuitable for rivers, where connectivity has a strong directional component. 3. We modify the conservation prioritization method and software, zonation, to account for connectivity in a manner better suited to freshwater ecosystems. Prioritization was performed using subcatchment/catchment-based planning units and connectivity was modified to have directional upstream and downstream components consistent with the ecology of our target species. 4. We demonstrate this modified method for rivers and streams in the southern North Island of New Zealand. Data included predicted occupancy from boosted regression tree models of species distributions for 18 fish species. The study area covered 2.1 million hectares and included 394 first- to fourth order catchment or subcatchment planning units. 5. Realistic modelling of connectivity had a major influence on the areas proposed for conservation. If connectivity was ignored, recommended conservation areas were very fragmented. By contrast, when connectivity was modelled, high priority conservation targets consisted of entire river basins or headwater subcatchments. 6. The proposed method serves as a starting point for the implementation of reserve selection methods in river ecosystems.},

	abstract = {There is growing awareness that predicting biological invasions will require the development of conceptual models for specific taxa at appropriate scales. Salmonids are ideal taxa for testing factors that influence invasions, because large numbers have been introduced worldwide for long periods and their ecology is well known. We evaluated the hypothesis that, among regions with suitable water temperatures, environmental resistance from flood disturbances that wash away trout fry strongly influence invasion success of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), the most widely introduced fish species. We predicted that flow regimes in regions where rainbow trout invasions are successful would match those in their native range and would differ from those in regions where invasions are moderately successful or failed. We tested six specific predictions about how timing, predictability, frequency, duration, and annual variability of floods, as well as timing of low flows, will differ relative to timing of rainbow trout fry emergence among five Holarctic regions. Analysis of hydrologic regimes for eight rivers each in the native range (Pacific Coast) and four regions where rainbow trout invasions varied from highly successful (Southern Appalachians) to moderate (Colorado, USA, and Hokkaido Island, Japan) or failed (Honshu Island) showed that winter flooding and summer low flows in Pacific Coast rivers that favor spring emergence of rainbow trout were closely matched by Southern Appalachian flow regimes. In contrast, the other three regions had spring or summer flooding that hampered rainbow trout recruitment to different degrees, and winter low flows. Rainbow trout invasion success was best explained by a match between timing of fry emergence and months of low flood probability. Alternatively, cold water temperatures, which hamper reproduction, and biotic interactions with brown trout (Salmo trutta) and whirling disease parasites may account for low invasion success in European regions. However, differences in genetic makeup of donor stocks and propagule pressure are unlikely mechanisms to explain invasions. Understanding how abiotic disturbances interact with timing of critical life history events to limit normative species will help ecologists develop more robust theories to predict invasion success.},

Spatially structured models have been more widely used for predicting future population dynamics and for assessing the extinction risk of a metapopulation. In this article, we first review such spatially structured models that have been applied to conservation biology, focusing on effects of asynchronization among local population dynamics on persistence of the whole metapopulation. Second, we introduce our ongoing project on extinction risk assessment of an endangered composite biennial plant, Aster kantoensis, in the riverside habitat, based on a lattice model for describing its spatiotemporal population dynamics. The model predicted that the extinction risk of A. kantoensis depends on both the frequency of flood occurrence and the time to coverage of a local habitat by other competitively stronger perennials. Finally, we present a measure (Hassell and Pacala's CV(2)) for quantifying the effect of asynchronization among local population dynamics on the persistence of a whole metapopulation in conservation ecology.},

I explore this correspondence with two empirical examples, a mainland- island metapopulation of the European common shrew (Sorex araneus) on islands in lakes and a classical metapopulation of the American pika (Ochotona princeps). The most robust result is the correspondence x = 2r/v, which value decreases with increasing strength of environmental stochasticity. Thus the impact of environmental stochasticity on population dynamics can, in principle, be inferred from the pattern of habitat patch occupancy in a metapopulation.},

	abstract = {Accurately measuring the rate of spread for expanding populations is important for reliably predicting their future spread, as well as for evaluating the effect of different conditions and management activities on that rate of spread. Although a number of methods have been developed for such measurement, all these are designed only for one- or two-dimensional spread. Species dispersing along rivers, however, require specific methods due to the distinctly branching structure of river networks. In this study, we analyse data regarding Eurasian beavers' modern recolonization of the Czech Republic. We developed a new methodology for quantifying spread of species dispersing along streams based on representation of the river network by means of a weighted graph. We defined two different network-based spread rate measures, one estimating the rate of range expansion, with the range defined as the total length of occupied streams, and the second, named range diameter, quantifying the progress along one or several main streams. In addition, we estimated the population growth rates, and, dividing the population size by the range size, we measured the density of beaver records within their overall range. Using linear regression, we compared four beaver populations under different environmental conditions in terms of each of these measures. Finally, we discuss the differences between our method and the classical approaches. Our method provided substantially higher spread rate values than did the classical methods. Both population growth and range expansion were found to follow logistic growth. In cases of there being no considerable barriers in dispersal routes, the rate of progress along main streams did not differ significantly among populations. In homogeneous environments, population densities remained relatively constant over time even though overall population sizes increased. This indicates that at large spatial scales, the population growth of beavers occurs through progressive space filling rather than increasing population density.},

	abstract = {ions of dollars are spent annually on watershed restoration and stream habitat improvement in the U.S. Pacific Northwest in an effort to increase fish populations. It is generally accepted that watershed restoration should focus on restoring natural processes that create and maintain habitat rather than manipulating instream habitats. However, most process-based restoration is site-specific, that is, conducted on a short stream reach. To synthesize site-specific techniques into a process-based watershed restoration strategy, we reviewed the, effectiveness of various restoration techniques at improving fish habitat arid developed a hierarchical strategy for prioritizing them. The hierarchical strategy we present is based on three elements: ( I) principles of watershed processes, (2) protecting existing high-quality habitats, and (3) current knowledge of the effectiveness of specific techniques. Initially, efforts should focus on protecting areas with intact processes and high-quality habitat. Following a watershed assessment, we recommend that restoration focus on reconnecting isolated high-quality fish habitats, such as instream or off-channel habitats made inaccessible by culverts or other artificial obstructions. Once the connectivity of habitats within a basin has been restored, efforts should focus on restoring hydrologic, geologic (sediment delivery and routing), and riparian processes through road decommissioning and maintenance, exclusion of livestock, and restoration of riparian areas. Instream habitat enhancement (e.g., additions of wood, boulders, or nutrients) should be employed. after restoring natural processes or where short-term improvements in habitat are needed (e.g., habitat for endangered species). Finally, existing research and monitoring is inadequate for all the techniques we reviewed, and additional, comprehensive physical and biological evaluations of most watershed restoration methods are needed.},

River restoration projects aim to maintain or increase ecosystem goods and services while protecting downstream and coastal ecosystems. There is growing interest in applying river restoration techniques to solve environmental problems, yet little agreement exists on what constitutes a successful river restoration effort. 2. We propose five criteria for measuring success, with emphasis on an ecological perspective. First, the design of an ecological river restoration project should be based on a specified guiding image of a more dynamic, healthy river that could exist at the site. Secondly, the river's ecological condition must be measurably improved. Thirdly, the river system must be more self-sustaining and resilient to external perturbations so that only minimal follow-up maintenance is needed. Fourthly, during the construction phase, no lasting harm should be inflicted on the ecosystem. Fifthly, both pre- and post-assessment must be completed and data made publicly available. 3. Determining if these five criteria have been met for a particular project requires development of an assessment protocol. We suggest standards of evaluation for each of the five criteria and provide examples of suitable indicators. 4. Synthesis and applications. Billions of dollars are currently spent restoring streams and rivers, yet to date there are no agreed upon standards for what constitutes ecologically beneficial stream and river restoration. We propose five criteria that must be met for a river restoration project to be considered ecologically successful. It is critical that the broad restoration community, including funding agencies, practitioners and citizen restoration groups, adopt criteria for defining and assessing ecological success in restoration. Standards are needed because progress in the science and practice of river restoration has been hampered by the lack of agreed upon criteria for judging ecological success. Without well-accepted criteria that are ultimately supported by funding and implementing agencies, there is little incentive for practitioners to assess and report restoration outcomes. Improving methods and weighing the ecological benefits of various restoration approaches require organized national-level reporting systems.},

	abstract = {Community ecological theory may play an important role in the development of a science of restoration ecology. Not only will the practice of restoration benefit from an increased focus on theory, but basic research in community ecology will also benefit. We pose several major thematic questions that are relevant to restoration from the perspective of community ecological theory and, for each, identify specific areas that are in critical need of further research to advance the science of restoration ecology. We ask, what are appropriate restoration endpoints from a community ecology perspective? The problem of measuring restoration at the community level, particularly given the high amount of variability inherent in most natural communities, is not easy, and may require a focus on restoration of community function (e.g., trophic structure) rather than a focus on the restoration of particular species. We ask, what are the benefits and limitations of using species composition or biodiversity measures as endpoints in restoration ecology? Since reestablishing all native species may rarely be possible, research is needed on the relationship between species richness and community stability of restored sites and on functional redundancy among species in regional colonist "pools." Efforts targeted at restoring system function must take into account the role of individual species, particularly if some species play a disproportionate role in processing material or are strong interactors. We ask, is restoration of habitat a sufficient approach to reestablish species and function? Many untested assumptions concerning the relationship between physical habitat structure and restoration ecology are being made in practical restoration efforts. We need rigorous testing of these assumptions, particularly to determine how generally they apply to different taxa and habitats. We ask, to what extent can empirical and theoretical work on community succession and dispersal contribute to restoration ecology? We distinguish systems in which succession theory may be broadly applicable from those in which it is probably not. If community development is highly predictable, it may be feasible to manipulate natural succession processes to accelerate restoration. We close by stressing that the science of restoration ecology is so intertwined with basic ecological theory that practical restoration efforts should rely heavily on what is known from theoretical and empirical research on how communities develop and are structured over time.},

	abstract = {Invasions by exotic species represent both threats to ecosystems as well as opportunities to learn more about them. Among the invaders that will have the largest impacts are those that directly modify ecosystems and thus have cascading effects for resident biota. Exotics can affect ecosystems by altering system-level flows, availability, or quality of nutrients, food, and physical resources (e.g. living space, water, heat or light). The invader-mediated control of physical resources, typically achieved through the modification of habitats, has received limited attention in invasion biology. This reflects a general trend in ecology, and only recently has the concept of ecosystem engineering been developed to account for the role of species that shape habitats. Plants and animals in terrestrial and aquatic systems can both create and destroy structure. When introduced into ecosystems, these exotic engineers cause physical state changes with effects that ramify throughout the system. Although the consequences of these modifications are varied and complex, insight gained from general ecological principles offers an opportunity to predict what invaders will do upon their integration into systems. Examples from the literature suggest that introduced ecosystem engineers that increase habitat complexity or heterogeneity tend to cause abundances and/or species richness to rise, while those that decrease complexity tend to have the reverse effect. In assessing such patterns, however, it is critical to also consider spatial scales and the life habits of resident organisms. In addition to providing predictive power, recognition of engineering as a major means by which invasive species affect ecosystems provides a unifying theme for invasion biology and offers a chance to consider more fully the general role of species in ecosystems.},

The aims of the experiment were to determine carp effects on nutrient dynamics and community composition, and partially separate bioturbation effects from the remaining carp effects such as excretion and predation. During the two months, carp influenced water quality and nutrient dynamics, altered phytoplankton biomass and composition and decreased submerged macrophyte biomass independently of sediment access, indicating that nutrient excretion was the primary mechanism for the carp effects. However, Secchi depth decreased while the concentration of suspended solids increased when carp access to the sediments was allowed, suggesting that bioturbation by carp influenced water transparency. Increase in phytoplankton (dominated by cyanobateria) and suspended solids resulted in reduced submerged macrophyte biomass through reduction of light availability. Zooplankton, numerically dominated by rotifers, increased in carp enclosures. In addition, benthic macroinvertebrates decreased in carp enclosures, regardless of the presence and absence of the netting. Because direct predation effects were not evident, carp probably affected benthic macroinvertebrates through reduction of submerged macrophytes. These results indicate that carp can have dramatic direct and indirect impacts on nutrient dynamics and littoral community structure through excretion and bioturbation. Ecosystem engineering by carp may therefore trigger a shift from a clear water state dominated by submerged macrophytes to a turbid water state dominated by phytoplankton.},

However, most research has been carried out in systems with discrete habitat boundaries and a clear insular structure. Stream networks deviate from the insular structure and can serve as excellent model systems for studying hierarchical community dynamics over different temporal and spatial extents. We used benthic invertebrate data from streams in a small northern Swedish catchment to test whether metacommunity dynamics change between seasons, across spatial hierarchies (i.e. at the whole catchment scale vs. the scales of first-order and second/third-order sites within the catchment) and between stream-order groups. We assessed metacommunity structure as a function of three relevant dispersal dimensions (directional downstream processes, along-stream dispersal and overland dispersal). These dispersal dimensions were related to species groups with relevant dispersal traits (flying capacity, drift propensity) and dispersal capacities (weak vs. strong) to elucidate whether the observed spatial signals were due to dispersal limitation or mass effects. Results showed complex community organization that varied between seasons, with the scale of observation, and with stream order. The importance of spatial factors and specific dispersal dimensions was highly dependent on the time of sampling and the scale of observation. The importance of environmental factors was more consistent in our analyses, but their effect on species community structure peaked at first-order sites. Our analyses of species dispersal traits were not unequivocal, but indicated that both mass effects and dispersal limitation could simultaneously contribute to the spatial signal at the scale of the whole catchment through different dispersal pathways. We conclude that the study of hierarchically organized ecosystems uncovers complex patterns of metacommunity organization that may deviate substantially from those of systems with insular structure and discrete habitat boundaries. Moreover, we show that dispersal constraints imposed by the dendritic structure of stream networks and distinct dispersal mechanisms (e.g. dispersal limitation) may be evident also at very small spatial extents. Thus, even at this small scale, a landscape management approach that takes the dendritic nature of stream networks into account is needed to effectively conserve stream biodiversity.},

To test the hypotheses that the benefits from group feeding change with resource level and population size, we performed field investigations and an enclosure experiment using the grazer caddisfly larva Micrasema quadriloba. The field investigations revealed aggregated distributions of larvae (indicator of aggregation, 1(delta) = 4.1 +/- 1.55, aggregated density: 12.7 +/- 5.3 individuals per 3.1 x 3.1 cm(2) (mean +/- 1 SD) when periphyton was abundant on stream cobbles and random distributions (I-delta = 1.0 +/- 0.11) when periphyton was scarce. In the enclosure experiment, the relative-growth rate (RGR) of the larvae at each population size showed different tendencies at high and low periphyton abundance Levels; RGR with abundant periphyton had a convex curve with a peak at intermediate population size, whereas RGR with scarce periphyton decreased linearly with increasing population size. The benefits from group feeding thus changed with resource level; larvae obtained high growth performance by group feeding behavior only when the resource was sufficiently abundant. The present study revealed not only that the optimum group size of larvae increased their growth performance, but also that this optimum group size occurred frequently in the field. We also discuss the mechanisms and benefits of group feeding by case-bearing caddisfly grazers. (C) 2006 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Three emerging characteristics of Madagascar's threatened freshwater biota deserve increased attention from the scientific and conservation communities. First, species richness is not low, as was once assumed for both the freshwater fishes and the invertebrates. Second, many species are restricted to a specific region or even to single river basins. Often these species are also limited to streams or rivers draining primary forest habitat. Finally, many of the island's freshwater fishes are basal taxa, having diverged earlier than any other extant members of their clade. As such, these taxa assume disproportional phylogenetic importance. In the face of ongoing environmental threats, links among microendemism, forest stream specialization, and basal phylogenetic position highlight the importance and vulnerability of these species and provide a powerful incentive for immediate conservation action.},

	abstract = {Although habitat fragmentation fosters extinctions, it also increases the probability of speciation by promoting and maintaining divergence among isolated populations. Here we test for the effects of two isolation factors that may reduce population dispersal within river networks as potential drivers of freshwater fish speciation: 1) the position of subdrainages along the longitudinal river gradient, and 2) the level of fragmentation within subdrainages caused by natural waterfalls. The occurrence of native freshwater fish species from 26 subdrainages of the Orinoco drainage basin (South America) was used to identify those species that presumably arose from in-situ cladogenetic speciation (i.e. neo-endemic species; two or more endemic species from the same genus) within each subdrainage. We related subdrainages fish diversity (i.e. total, endemic and neo-endemic species richness) and an index of speciation to our two isolation factors while controlling for subdrainages size and energy availability. The longitudinal position of subdrainages was unrelated to any of our diversity measures, a result potentially explained by the spatial grain we used and/or the contemporary connection between Orinoco and Amazon basins via the upstream Casiquiare region. However, we found higher neo-endemic species richness and higher speciation index values in highly fragmented subdrainages. These results suggest that habitat fragmentation generated by natural waterfalls drives cladogenetic speciation in fragmented subdrainages. More generally, our results emphasize the role of history and natural waterfalls as biogeographic barriers promoting freshwater biodiversity in river drainage basins.},

	doi = {10.1890/12-1564.1},
	abstract = {Hydrologic connectivity is critical to the structure, function, and dynamic process of river ecosystems. Dams, road crossings, and water diversions impact connectivity by altering flow regimes, behavioral cues, local geomorphology, and nutrient cycling. This longitudinal fragmentation of river ecosystems also increases genetic and reproductive isolation of aquatic biota such as migratory fishes. The cumulative effects on fish passage of many structures along a river are often substantial, even when individual barriers have negligible impact. Habitat connectivity can be improved through dam removal or other means of fish passage improvement (e.g., ladders, bypasses, culvert improvement). Environmental managers require techniques for comparing alternative fish passage restoration actions at alternative or multiple locations. Herein, we examined a graph-theoretic algorithm for assessing upstream habitat connectivity to investigate both basic and applied fish passage connectivity problems. First, we used hypothetical watershed configurations to assess general alterations to upstream fish passage connectivity with changes in watershed network topology (e.g., linear vs. highly dendritic) and the quantity, location, and passability of each barrier. Our hypothetical network modeling indicates that locations of dams with limited passage efficiency near the watershed outlet create a strong fragmentation signal but are not individually sufficient to disconnect the system. Furthermore, there exists a threshold in the number of dams beyond which connectivity declines precipitously, regardless of watershed topology and dam configuration. Watersheds with highly branched configurations are shown to be less susceptible to disconnection as measured by this metric. Second, we applied the model to prioritize barrier improvement in the mainstem of the Truckee River, Nevada, USA. The Truckee River application demonstrates the ability of the algorithm to address conditions common in fish passage projects including incomplete data, parameter uncertainty, and rapid application. This study demonstrates the utility of a graph-theoretic approach for assessing fish passage connectivity in dendritic river networks assuming full basin utilization for a given species, guild, or community of concern.},

	abstract = {1. Spatial population structure plays an important role in species persistence, evolution and conservation. Benthic stream fishes are diverse and frequently imperilled, yet the determinants and spatial scaling of their population structure are understudied. 2. We investigated the range-wide population genetic structure of Roanoke logperch (Percina rex), an endangered, benthic stream fish of the eastern United States. Fish were sampled from 35 sites and analysed at 11 microsatellite DNA loci. Clustering models were used to sort individuals into genetically cohesive groups and thereby estimate the spatial scaling of population structure. We then used Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (BGLMMs) to test alternative hypotheses about the environmental factors most responsible for generating structure, as measured by the differentiation statistic F-ST. 3. Clustering models delineated seven discrete populations, whose boundaries coincided with agents of fragmentation, including hydroelectric dams and tailwaters. In the absence of hydrological barriers, gene flow was extensive throughout catchments, whereas there was no evidence for contemporary dispersal between catchments across barriers. 4. In the best-supported BGLMM,F-ST was positively related to the spatial distance and degree of hydrological alteration between sites and negatively related to genetic diversity within sites. Whereas the effect of tailwaters was equivocal, dams strongly influenced differentiation: the effect of a dam on F-ST was comparable to that of a between-site distance of over 1200km of unimpounded river. Overall, the effect of distance-mediated dispersal was negligible compared to the combined effects of fragmentation and genetic drift. 5. The contemporary population structure of P. rex comprises a few geographically extensive islands' that are fragmented by hydroelectric projects. This information clarifies the importance of a catchment-scale perspective on conserving the species and suggests that its recovery may require genetic and/or demographic reconnection of presently isolated populations.},

Therefore, the interaction between external drivers of stream temperature and the internal structure of integrated stream systems ultimately determines channel water temperature. This paper presents a synoptic, ecologically based discussion of the external drivers of stream temperature, the internal structures and processes that insulate and buffer stream temperatures, and the mechanisms of human influence on stream temperature. It provides a holistic perspective on the diversity of natural dynamics and human activities that influence stream temperature, including discussions of the role of the hyporheic zone. Key management implications include: (1) Protecting or reestablishing in-stream flow is critical for restoring desirable thermal regimes in streams. (2) Modified riparian vegetation, groundwater dynamics, and channel morphology are all important pathways of human influence on channel-water temperature and each pathway should be addressed in management plans. (3) Stream temperature research and monitoring programs will be jeopardized by an inaccurate or incomplete conceptual understanding of complex temporal and spatial stream temperature response patterns to anthropogenic influences. (4) Analyses of land-use history and the historical vs contemporary structure of the stream channel, riparian zone, and alluvial aquifer are important prerequisites for applying mechanistic temperature models to develop management prescriptions to meet in-channel temperature goals.},

	abstract = {Organisms inhabiting stream ecosystems are vulnerable to the effects of habitat fragmentation because of the inherent hierarchical structure of patches in riverscapes. Fragmentation caused by road-stream crossings contributes to alteration of stream organism distribution globally. We used principles of graph theory to develop three artificial riverscapes and test for network-scale changes in simulated fish dispersal caused by barriers that resembled the properties of road-stream crossings (semi-permeable; numerous within a network). Fish occupancy of nodes (habitat patches) declined in the presence of a single barrier when barrier permeability was {\textless}0.5, and fish with high dispersal experienced greater declines in occupancy compared to fish with low dispersal. Probability of extirpation (emigration without return) from fragments was greatest for nodes that mimicked headwater stream segments. We used a network-scale measure of habitat connectivity (the dendritic connectivity index; DCI) to measure changes in occupancy across all nodes and found the DCI predicted declines in occupancy as the number of barriers in the riverscape increased. Declines in occupancy were driven by threshold responses by fish to the occurrence of small fragments ({\textless}= 3 nodes). Our simulations identified three important properties of stream fish dispersal that are likely relevant to natural systems: (i) species dispersal affinities determine response to fragmentation; (ii) fragments that are too "small" for organism persistence drive declines in riverscape occupancy; and (iii) measurements of structural (habitat) connectivity used to draw inference on functional (population) connectivity require knowledge of organism dispersal affinity and dispersal-mediated response to barrier positioning.

Results showed that the way in which channel morphology controlled exchange flows differed with stream size and, in some cases, with channel constraint. Pool-step sequences drove hyporheic exchange in the second-order sites, creating exchange flows with relatively short residence times. Multiple features interacted to drive hyporheic exchange flow in the unconstrained fifth-order site, where pool-riffle sequences and a channel split created exchange flows with short residence times, whereas a secondary channel created exchange flows with long residence times. There was relatively little exchange flow in the bedrock-constrained fifth-order site.

Nearly all (96.6\%) species occurring in restored reaches were present in reaches within a distance of 5km up- or downstream of the restored reach. 3.Species richness in restored reaches was correlated with species richness within a 5-km species pool. This relationship was more pronounced for common than for rare fishes and applied to both the total number of fish species at the restored reach and the number of additional fish species that were not present at unrestored conditions. 4.The richness of the regional species pools was greatly impoverished. On average, only 50\% of all species considered to represent natural reference assemblages were present. The limited success in establishing natural fish assemblages in restored reaches was attributed to spatial limitation (e.g. due to fragmentation) and an impoverished regional species pools from which restored reaches recruit. 5.We recommend that integrated river restoration management should consider not only the abiotic prerequisites of successful restorations, but also the structure and quality of the regional species pool.},

Stream restoration has been used to improve stream conditions and, in part, to ameliorate these losses. However, the relationship between restoration and recovery of biological diversity is unclear.

We compared restored urban streams to urban nonrestored, nonurban, and reference (minimally degraded) streams using five measures each of fish and benthic macroinvertebrate diversity. Both multivariate and univariate statistical analyses show biological diversity of restored urban streams to be similar to nonrestored urban streams and lower than nonurban and reference streams. Restored urban sites showed no apparent increase in biological diversity through time, while diversity decreased at two of the reference streams coincident with increased urban development within their catchments. Our results indicate that restoration approaches commonly used regionally as in these urban streams are not leading to recovery of native stream biodiversity.

	abstract = {This study examined the effects of the configuration of wood structures on the use of local autumn and winter habitats by fish in a remeandering reach of a large lowland river. Fish diversity was higher at the simple wood-structure (SWS) and the log-jam (LJ) sites than at the no-wood (NW) sites during both seasons. In particular, the diversity at the LJ sites was higher than that at the SWS sites during the winter. The abundance of the four dominant fish species was generally higher at the LJ sites than at the NW sites during both seasons. The SWS and LJ sites were characterized by greater depths, finer bed materials, and more diverse flow conditions during the autumn. During the winter, the LJ sites were characterized by slower currents and finer bed materials. These habitat features satisfied the various habitat requirements of the fish observed in our study reach; during the autumn, areas with fast and slow currents were favorable for juvenile salmon, silt and sand bed materials for lamprey, and deep areas for one species of goby, while slow currents were critical in the winter for abovementioned fish species. Engineered log jams were also effective in supporting the colonization of fish during both seasons. These findings suggest that a larger and more complex wood structure, particularly log jams, plays important roles in creating local habitats suitable for various fish species during the autumn and winter and in preserving fish abundance and diversity in large lowland rivers.},

Having been in widespread use for the last 80 years, at an estimated cost of hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars each year, the effectiveness of these structures is still widely debated in the literature. Many studies of varying quality have been undertaken that attempt to address this issue, but it has proved difficult for practitioners to develop a consensus regarding the utility of these structures, despite their continued use. Systematic review methodology was used to formally synthesize empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of engineered in-stream structures as a management tool to increase salmonid abundance. Meta-analysis shows that evidence regarding the effectiveness of in-stream devices is equivocal. Heterogeneity is significant both for population size and local habitat preference. This heterogeneity is related to stream width, with in-stream devices being less effective in larger streams. Consequently, widespread use of in-stream structures for restoration, particularly in larger streams, is not supported by the current scientific evidence base.},

	abstract = {The influence of spatial processes on diversity and community dynamics is generally recognized in ecology and also applied to conservation projects involving forest and grassland ecosystems. Riverine ecosystems, however, have been for a long time viewed from a local or linear perspective, even though the treelike branching of river networks is universal. River networks (so-called dendritic networks) are not only structured in a hierarchic way, but the dendritic landscape structure and physical flows often dictate distance and directionality of dispersal. Theoretical models suggest that the specific riverine network structure directly affects diversity patterns. Recent experimental and comparative data are supporting this idea. Here, I provide an introduction on theoretical findings suggesting that genetic diversity, heterozygosity and species richness are higher in dendritic systems compared to linear or two-dimensional lattice landscapes. The characteristic diversity patterns can be explained in a network perspective, which also offers universal metrics to better understand and protect riverine diversity. I show how appropriate metrics describing network centrality and dispersal distances are superior to classic measures still applied in aquatic ecology, such as Strahler order or Euclidian distance. Finally, knowledge gaps and future directions of research are identified. The network perspective employed here may help to generalize findings on riverine biodiversity research and can be applied to conservation and river restoration projects.},

However, species differ markedly in the shared genetic information they embody, and this information is not taken into account if species are prioritized by threat status alone. We developed a system of prioritization that incorporates both threat status and genetic information and applied it to 9546 species of birds worldwide. We devised a simple measure of a species' genetic value that takes into account the shape of the entire taxonomic tree of birds. This measure approximates the evolutionary history that each species embodies and sums to the phylogenetic diversity of the entire taxonomic tree. We then combined this genetic value with each species' probability of extinction to create a species-specific measure of expected loss of genetic information. The application of our methods to the world's avifauna showed that ranking species by expected loss of genetic information may help preserve bird evolutionary history by upgrading those threatened species with fewer close relatives. We recommend developing a mechanism to incorporate a species' genetic value into the prioritization framework.},

	abstract = {The highly endangered freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera L.) has strongly declined throughout Europe and is a priority species in aquatic conservation. The complex life cycle of M. margaritifera includes an obligate development phase of glochidia larvae on a suitable host fish. Knowledge on the progression of the parasitic phase and on the factors governing excystment of juvenile mussels are particularly crucial for artificial breeding and conservation measures. The core objective of this study was to study excystment of M. margaritifera after maintaining the infested hosts under constant water temperatures between 11 and 12 degrees C and to determine the sum of daily water temperatures (day degrees) required by M. margaritifera for completion of metamorphosis. In a standardized laboratory experiment, excystment of juvenile mussels from brown trout (Salmo trutta) was found between 1700 and 3400 day degrees post infestation, indicating highly variable, development times of individual glochidia and the absence of a previously postulated threshold temperature of {\textgreater}= 15 degrees C for successful excystment of living juveniles. Consequently, the parasitic phase does not seem to limit the current distribution range and reintroduction of the species into cool headwater areas, as well as the culturing under constant water temperature conditions in typical salmonid fish hatchery setups. The concept of day degrees of development may also be useful to test the ecological implications of observed genetic differences among different populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

	abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that globally imperiled freshwater mussels (Order: Unionoida) can be used as an indicator of fish communities in lowland aquatic systems for relatively small geographic areas (i.e., {\textless}100 km(2)). The survey was conducted in 13 reaches within a network of agricultural drainage channels and in 9 floodplain backwaters in Central Japan. In each site, the fish community was examined on four seasonal occasions (spring to early summer, mid-summer, fall to early winter, and winter) and related to the mussel community. Total abundance, taxon richness, and diversity index were used to characterize fish communities. Mussel community variables predicted some aspects of fish communities, but such patterns were seasonally limited. In both systems, mussel community variables had no predictive power for the total abundance of fishes. In drainage channels, taxon richness of mussels was a good predictor of all fish community variables except for total abundance in early summer. In winter, mussel abundance predicted well the taxon richness of the fish community, while taxon richness predicted the diversity index of the fish community. In backwaters, mussel abundance was a good predictor of fish community variables except total abundance in mid-summer. A relatively minor portion ({\textless}23\%) of fish-mussel relationships was attributable to direct commensalism between mussels and bitterlings. A conceptual framework was provided to help identify the mechanisms behind fish-mussel relationships. Our findings validated the use of mussels as an indicator of high-quality summer rearing habitats in backwaters and wintering and reproduction habitats of fishes in drainage channels.

	abstract = {1. In rearing experiments performed between 1997 and 2007, captive-bred juvenile mussels were harvested shortly after they had dropped off their host fish, and exposed to different types of cages and holding systems. 2. Survival of juveniles ranged from 0 to 92\% in the first 4 months, but the mean annual mortality was high in all trials and with all systems. In three trials with sheet cages and sediment boxes exposed to mussel rivers from an initial number of 1440 to 1660 only one to eight mussels reached 4 years of age. 3. With the exception of mussels kept in spring water no relationship between growth and survival was observed. 4. Low survival rates were obtained in sheet cages exposed to very oligotrophic and highly eutrophic brook stretches. Several natural sites that were lacking recruitment in the wild nevertheless showed good results in the cages. 5. All holding systems showed irregular variations in survival rates. Pairs of sheet cages showed no correlation between the survival of mussels in the adjacent cages. In contrast, growth rates were correlated. 6. No relationship could be found between the growth or survival in sheet cages at different sites and brooks and the corresponding data on water chemistry. 7. The systems tested for rearing young mussels involving a minimal time and effort in the natural habitat were not successful due to the elevated mortality rates of juveniles. 8. The rearing success of young pearl mussels in cages in the water flow of mussel rivers gives no information about the suitability of these sites for natural reproduction. Thus, to find potential natural habitats for Margaritifera, it is imperative to survey water quality, sediments and habitat structure. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Our objectives were to: G) quantify the overall rate of sculpin movement, (ii) assess variation in movement among years, individuals, and sculpin size classes, (iii) relate movement to variation in stream flow and population size structure, and GO quantify relationships between movement and individual growth rates. 2. Movements were very restricted: median and mean movement distances for all sculpin size classes over a 45 day period were 1.3 and 4.4 m respectively. Nevertheless, there was a high degree of intrapopulation and temporal variation in sculpin movement. Movement of juveniles increased with discharge and with the density of large adults. Movement by small and large adults was not influenced by stream flow, but large adults where more mobile when their own density was high. Finally, there were differences in the growth rates of mobile and sedentary sculpins. Mobile juveniles grew faster than sedentary individuals under conditions of low flow and high density of large adults, whereas adults exhibited the opposite pattern. 3. Our results support the hypothesis that juvenile movement and growth is influenced by both intraspecific interactions with adults and stream flow. In contrast, adult movement appears to be influenced by competitive interactions among residents for suitable space. The relationship between movement and growth may provide a negative feedback mechanism regulating mottled sculpin populations in this system.},

	abstract = {1. Freshwater mussels are in decline throughout their range. The lack of natural recruitment in freshwater pearl mussel populations and other freshwater molluscs has led to controversies about the usefulness and applicability of captive breeding techniques for their conservation. 2. The current state of rearing and culturing programmes for freshwater mussels in Europe and North America is reviewed here with a focus on the endangered freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera). Different strategies of propagation and the key factors of success are addressed and conservation management decisions are discussed with respect to risk reduction and the intensity of the culturing system. 3. Based on the rearing techniques applied for multiple species in North America, and for the genus Margaritifera in European countries, sufficient numbers of juveniles can be produced to sustain selected populations. However, captive breeding and stocking should be carefully documented and must not replace the restoration of functional stream habitats. 4. From a conservation point of view, captive breeding of endangered mussel species can be a last-minute rescue tool in order to retain the evolutionary potential of priority populations which would not persist long enough to benefit from habitat restoration practices.

	abstract = {Anthropogenic, abiotic factors are considered the main cause of recruitment failure of unionid mussels, including the freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera). This large-scale investigation instead examined the relationship between biotic factors and mussel recruitment. Mussel population size and density were positively related to recruitment and to juvenile mussel density. Juvenile mussel density appeared to be the more accurate measure of recruitment of the two. Host fish density of young-of-the-year and older brown trout (Salmo trutta) were positively related to recruitment. Moreover, the mean density of both age classes of fish, when grouped into density classes, was positively related to juvenile mussel density, an effect that decreased at trout densities above 10 trout 100?m-2. Mussel population size and density were relatively more important to recruitment than trout density. To increase recruitment of juvenile mussels, managers should apply measures that increase mussel density, and trout density up to about 10 trout 100?m-2 in proximity to mussel beds. Mussel beds may also be managed; one possible measure within small and sparse mussel populations may be to concentrate the remaining mussels in areas where trout density is high. Likewise, young-of-the-year trout may also be moved to areas of high mussel density, as young trout individuals tend not to move far during their first year. This may increase mussel larval infection rates and mussel recruitment. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This lab experiment used organic-rich lowland river sediment in a newly designed erosion chamber, the Benthic Water Column Simulator, generating well-defined ratios of shear velocity u* to turbulence intensity. Eight consecutive resuspension events, 1-8, were initiated at u* = 1.1 cm s(-1). Sedimentary and phosphorus entrainment decreased from 20.4 g m(-2) h(-1) and 111.6 mg m(-2) h(-1) at event 1 to 1.31 g m(-2) h(-1) and 18.7 mg m(-2) h(-1) at event 8, suggesting an exhaustion of particulate and dissolved sediment constituents. Entrainment of particle-associated (PA) bacteria (132.7 x 10(9)-251.1 x 10(9) cells m(-2) h(-1)) was strongly correlated to that of particles. Free-living (FL) bacteria (-27.6 x 10(9)-36.4 x 10(9) cells m(-2) h(-1)) were fractionally entrained. Numbers of PA bacteria remained low after each event, whereas those of FL bacteria strongly increased 5-15 h after an event because of growth due to increased availability of dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nutrients following each event. FL bacteria community structure also changed during IRR. The systematic changes over consecutive IRR cycles show a strong effect in all considered parameters that elude the typical single-event, steady-state experiments. IRR should thus be considered in two respects: experimental protocols on riverine water quality should be revised. In ecosystem modeling, IRR should be considered to better predict extent and effect of resuspension. Only IRR adequately reflects the natural interplay between hydrodynamics and organisms in rivers.},

	abstract = {1. The glochidia (larvae) of the freshwater mussels Unionoidea must attach to a host fish to pass through their parasitic stage. Glochidial size is species-specific: varying from c. 0.05 mm to c. 0.45 mm shell length. 2. There is a trade-off between size and number such that fertility is high in species with small glochidia and vice versa. 3. There appear to be no allometric constraints on glochidial size. Phylogenetic constraints seem to be of minor importance (perhaps with the exception of the Margaritiferidae). Furthermore, no influence can be shown for the breeding type (long- or short-term breeder) or the habitat type with respect to the water current. The number and type of marsupia (four marsupia, two marsupia, two marsupia on the posterior part of demibranchs) also does not seem to be related to glochidial size. 4. The morphological factor 'hook on the glochidial shell' and the ecological factor 'host range' (number of host fish families) are of importance. Glochidia with a hook are larger than unhooked ones. They frequently attach to tough host tissues and therefore have to be powerful. Glochidial size also increases as the host range increases. This relationship probably evolved because of an interplay of the duration of the parasitic stage and the host's immunological defences. 5. The analyses suggest that glochidial size is a crucial component in the evolution of a continuum of reproductive strategies among the Unionoidea. Representatives of one end of the continuum are the Margaritiferidae with small glochidia, high fertility, long parasitic stage, protracted growth on the host and narrow host range. They are highly specialized with respect to the habitat. Some Anodonta species represent the opposite end with large glochidia, low fertility, short parasitic stage with no growth being involved and large host range. They live in a variety of habitats.},

With a few exceptions the genetic affinities of the populations are the closest within the same drainage basin. In central Europe and Northern Italy genetic differences between drainage systems are relatively large. Populations from north-eastern Italy are genetically similar to Danubian populations. Mussels from the islands of Corsica and Sardinia are more closely related to populations from the Italian peninsula than to French populations from the Rhone drainage system. Genetic relationships within U. pictorum from central Europe reflect palaeogeographical relationships between river systems during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. Literature data on two North American unionid species and one European fish species show the same relationship between genetic diversity and the history of drainage systems, although the correlations are less strong. In France and Italy this correspondence is much less evident. Population dynamic processes and human activities leading to populational bottlenecks might have obscured it.},

We used allozymes and a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene to examine genetic variation in populations from isolated waterholes, belonging to four major inland drainages in eastern Australia. Based on evidence from other invertebrates in the region we predicted that, in each species, we would find evidence of historical connectivity among populations from different drainages. This was clearly not the case, as for the two species that occurred in more than one drainage there was evidence of both current and past restriction to gene flow. Moreover, given the potential for extensive dispersal of these mussels through the river systems during flood times via their fish hosts, we predicted low levels of genetic variation among populations from waterholes in the same drainage. Contrary to our expectations, all four species showed some evidence of restricted gene flow among waterholes within drainages. This suggests that either (a) mussel larvae are not produced during flood times, when their fish hosts would be free to move between waterholes, or (b) mussel larvae are attached to their hosts at these times, but the fish movement is limited between waterholes.},

	abstract = {Dispersal can be a major determinant of the distribution and abundance of animals, as well as a key mechanism linking behaviour to population dynamics, but progress in understanding dispersal has been hampered by the lack of a general framework for modelling dispersal. This study tested the capacity of simple models to summarize and predict the lake-wide dispersal of an emerging cohort of young-of-the-year brook charr Salvelinus fontinalis, over 12 surveys conducted during a 2-month period. The models are based on two types of dispersal kernel, the normal distribution from a simple diffusion process, and a Laplace distribution depicting exponential decay of the frequency of dispersers away from the point of origin. In all, four models were assessed: one-group diffusion (D1S) and exponential (E1S) models assuming homogeneous dispersal behaviour within the cohort, and two-group diffusion (D2S) and exponential (E2S) models accounting for intrapopulation differences in dispersal between sedentary and mobile individuals. A rigorous cross-validation, based on calibrating the models to the distributions from the first two surveys only and then validating them on the remaining 10 distributions, was used to compare model predictions with observed values for five properties of the dispersal distributions: counts in individual shoreline sections; mean lateral displacement, variance and kurtosis of displacements; and the percentage of long-distance dispersers. Substantial intrapopulation heterogeneity in dispersal behaviour was apparent: 83\% of all individuals were estimated to be sedentary and the remainder mobile. Remarkably, the two-group exponential model E2S - calibrated to data from only two surveys conducted 3.5 and 8.5 days after the beginning of emergence - predicted reasonably well all properties of the spatial distribution of the cohort until the end of the study, 7 weeks later. Standardized measures of mobility derived from simple models may lead to better understanding of population dynamics and improved management. Specifically, the ability to accurately predict long-distance dispersal may be critical to assessing population persistence and cohort strength whenever key habitats, such as refugia or productive areas supporting a large proportion of the cohort, are sparsely distributed or distant from the point of origin.},

The resultant distribution of the traveling distance, which is called dispersal function, is then expressed by using a modified Bessel function of the second kind of order (k - 1). It is shown that the front of the distribution spreads with time in an accelerated manner during an early phase of expansion if the heterogeneity is sufficiently large, which is consistent with the results from previous studies of biological invasions By using the data obtained from mark-recapture experiments using traps, we can obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of three parameters: heterogeneity in the traveling duration, which is defined by (Ilk); the mean dispersal ability. which is defined by the product of the diffusion coefficient and the mean traveling duration; and the trap efficiency.

Yearly restocking in this river follows a single generation of captive breeding. Among the adults returning to the river to spawn, between 11\% and 41\% each year were born in hatchery. Their relative reproductive success (RRS) was nearly half that of wild-born fish (0.55). RRS varied with life stage, being 0.71 for fish released at the fry stage and 0.42 for fish released as smolt. The lower reproductive success of salmon released as smolt was partly mediated by the modification of the proportion of single-sea-winter/multi-sea-winter fish. Overall, our results suggest that modifications in survival and growth rates alter the life-history strategies of these fish at the cost of their reproductive success. Our results underline the potential fitness decrease, warn on long-term evolutionary consequences for the population of repeated stocking and support the adoption of more natural rearing conditions for captive juveniles and their release at a younger stage, such as unfed fry.},

	abstract = {Key goals of conservation are to protect both species and the functional and genetic diversity they represent. A strictly species-based approach may underrepresent rare, threatened, or genetically distinct species and overrepresent widespread species. Although reserves are created for a number of reasons, including economic, cultural, and ecological reasons, their efficacy has been measured primarily in terms of how well species richness is protected, and it is useful to compare how well they protect other measures of diversity. We used Proteaceae species-occurrence data in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa to illustrate differences in the spatial distribution of species and evolutionary diversity estimated from a new maximum-likelihood molecular phylogeny. We calculated species richness, phylogenetic diversity (i.e., summed phylogenetic branch lengths in a site), and a site-aggregated measure of biogeographically weighted evolutionary distinctiveness (i.e., an abundance weighted measure that captures the unique proportion of the phylogenetic tree a species represents) for sites throughout the Cape Floristic Region. Species richness and phylogenetic diversity values were highly correlated for sites in the region, but species richness was concentrated at a few sites that underrepresented the much more spatially extensive distribution of phylogenetic diversity. Biogeographically weighted evolutionary diversity produced a scheme of prioritization distinct from the other 2 metrics and highlighted southern sites as conservation priorities. In these sites, the high values of biogeographically weighted evolutionary distinctiveness were the result of a nonrandom relation between evolutionary distinctiveness and geographical rarity, where rare species also tended to have high levels of evolutionary distinctiveness. Such distinct and rare species are of particular concern, but are not captured by conservation schemes that focus on species richness or phylogenetic diversity alone.},

	volume = {12},
	issn = {1471-2148},
	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-12-172},
	abstract = {Background: Galeommatoidea is a superfamily of bivalves that exhibits remarkably diverse lifestyles. Many members of this group live attached to the body surface or inside the burrows of other marine invertebrates, including crustaceans, holothurians, echinoids, cnidarians, sipunculans and echiurans. These symbiotic species exhibit high host specificity, commensal interactions with hosts, and extreme morphological and behavioral adaptations to symbiotic life. Host specialization to various animal groups has likely played an important role in the evolution and diversification of this bivalve group. However, the evolutionary pathway that led to their ecological diversity is not well understood, in part because of their reduced and/or highly modified morphologies that have confounded traditional taxonomy. This study elucidates the taxonomy of the Galeommatoidea and their evolutionary history of symbiotic lifestyle based on a molecular phylogenic analysis of 33 galeommatoidean and five putative galeommatoidean species belonging to 27 genera and three families using two nuclear ribosomal genes (18S and 28S ribosomal DNA) and a nuclear (histone H3) and mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase subunit I) protein-coding genes. Results: Molecular phylogeny recovered six well-supported major clades within Galeommatoidea. Symbiotic species were found in all major clades, whereas free-living species were grouped into two major clades. Species symbiotic with crustaceans, holothurians, sipunculans, and echiurans were each found in multiple major clades, suggesting that host specialization to these animal groups occurred repeatedly in Galeommatoidea. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the evolutionary history of host association in Galeommatoidea has been remarkably dynamic, involving frequent host switches between different animal phyla. Such an unusual pattern of dynamic host switching is considered to have resulted from their commensalistic lifestyle, in which they maintain filter-feeding habits even in symbiotic habitats. The results of the molecular phylogenetic analysis did not correspond with the current taxonomic circumscription. Galeommatidae and Lasaeidae were polyphyletic, and Basterotia, which is traditionally assigned to Cyamioidea, formed a monophyletic clade within Galeommatoidea.},

	abstract = {Outcrossing in plants is influenced by the availability of pollinators and compatible mates. both of which may be modified by the population and community Context in which plant-pollinator interactions occur. Although indirect interactions among plants through shared pollinators are often expected to be competitive, pollinator sharing may be beneficial when plant species jointly attract or maintain populations of pollinators. In this study. I tested the hypothesis that pollinator-sharing congeners facilitate reproduction in a focal taxon. Clarkia xantiana ssp. xontiana, and that positive interactions are most pronounced in small and sparse populations. Population Surveys revealed that C. x. xantiana frequently coexists with pollinator-sharing congeners except at the periphery of its range. Populations varied extensively in size and density, with small populations more likely associated with pollinator-sharing congeners conversely, Populations occuring,11 alone were more likely large. Flowering schedules in Clarkia communities ranged from segreated to aggregated. Although there was not strong evidence of character displacement, modes in flowering, time were often staggered among Clarkia species resulting in a protracted flowering season within plant communities. Studies of bee pollinator availability in populations and pollen limitation to reproduction in 39 replicate populations revealed that populations occuring with multiple congeners had high pollinator availability and low pollen limitation of reproduction compared to populations occuring alone. Population size was inversely related to pollen limitation but did not affect pollinator availability, suggesting that Allee effects were caused by mate limitation. Intraspecific interactions were also positive at a fine spatial scale where pollen deposition increased with the density of closely neighboring conspecifics across 11 populations. Overall, inter- and intraspecific interactions through shared pollinators were generally facilitative, suggesting that population viability and title coexistence of ecologically similar Clarkia species may be promoted by positive reproductive interactions.},

	abstract = {The aggregation of individuals into foraging flocks is one behavioural trait that, if disrupted, can cause the Allee effect, which is a slowing in population growth at low density or small population size, and this can greatly increase the risk of extinction. Here, I describe intraspecific flocking behaviour of a colour-banded population of speckled warblers, Chthonicola sagittata, a species that has declined across a large part of its range in the fragmented temperate woodlands of Australia. I make predictions about the context in which the Allee effect might be expressed and the consequences for the viability of populations living in small habitat remnants. Speckled warblers lived in discrete, stable social groups throughout winter, the nucleus of which was the residents from one or more adjacent breeding territories. The timing and mode of flock formation and the size of flocks varied between two winters, apparently in response to the severity of conditions; thus flocking probably facilitates increased foraging efficiency and predator detection, potentially leading to increased survival in harsh conditions. Because flock territories were up to 30 ha each, and larger territories are likely, birds living in remnants smaller than 40 ha may suffer increased mortality if there are too few birds available to form flocks of an appropriate size to facilitate the benefits of grouping when conditions are most extreme. Further, in small remnants where survival is reduced, dominance behaviour and male-male competition may act to compound the Allee effect by reducing reproductive success. Regardless of these predictions, speckled warbler populations may only be viable in remnants that are large enough to support multiple flocks, to enable rapid recruitment to breeding vacancies and thus provide adequate numbers of birds for flocking.

Comparative genotyping and phenotyping of nearly 12,000 O. biennis individuals revealed that in plots protected from insects, resistance to herbivores declined through time owing to changes in flowering time and lower defensive ellagitannins in fruits, whereas plant competitive ability increased. This independent real-time evolution of plant resistance and competitive ability in the field resulted from the relaxation of direct selective effects of insects on plant defense and through indirect effects due to reduced herbivory on plant competitors.},

	abstract = {Japanese camellia (Camellia japonica) and its seed predator, the camellia weevil (Curculio camelliae), provide a notable example of a geographic mosaic of coevolution. In the species interaction, the offensive trait of the weevil (rostrum length) and the defensive trait of the plant (pericarp thickness) are involved in a geographically-structured arms race, and these traits and selective pressures acting on the plant defence vary greatly across a geographical landscape. To further explore the geographical structure of this interspecific interaction, we tested whether the geographical variation in the weevil rostrum over an 800-km range along latitude is attributed to local natural selection or constrained by historical (phylogeographical) events of local populations. Phylogeographical analyses of the mitochondrial DNA sequences of the camellia weevil revealed that this species has experienced differentiation into two regions, with a population bottleneck and subsequent range and/or population expansion within each region. Although these phylogeographical factors have affected the variation in rostrum length, analyses of competing factors for the geographical variation revealed that this pattern is primarily determined by the defensive trait of the host plant rather than by the effects of historical events of populations and a climatic factor (annual mean temperature). Thus, our study suggests the overwhelming strength of coevolutionary selection against the effect of historical events, which may have limited local adaptation.},

	abstract = {Asymmetrical competition determines which of two seed predators drives the evolution of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia) cones. Red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) are effective preemptive competitors in lodgepole pine forests so that red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra) are uncommon and selection from Tamiasciurus drives cone evolution. When Tamiasciurus are absent, crossbills increase in abundance and coevolve in an evolutionary arms race with pine. Similarly, Tamiasciurus alters the evolutionary trajectories of large-seeded pines, many of which rely on birds (Corvidae) for their seed dispersal. Populations therefore exhibit a selection mosaic with coevolutionary hot spots. In the coevolutionary hot spots, divergent selection on crossbills potentially leads to reproductive isolation and speciation. This results in a subsequent reduction in the geographic mosaic but diversifies the adaptive landscape on which crossbills have radiated. Thus, divergent selection is a double-edged sword. Divergent selection is critical in creating a selection mosaic but erodes the selection mosaic when it promotes reproductive isolation and speciation.},

	abstract = {Climate change is predicted to increase both drought frequency and duration, and when coupled with substantial warming, will establish a new hydroclimatological model for many regions(1). Large-scale, warm droughts have recently occurred in North America, Africa, Europe, Amazonia and Australia, resulting in major effects on terrestrial ecosystems, carbon balance and food security(2,3). Here we compare the functional response of above-ground net primary production to contrasting hydroclimatic periods in the late twentieth century (1975-1998), and drier, warmer conditions in the early twenty-first century (2000-2009) in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. We find a common ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUEe: above-ground net primary production/evapotranspiration) across biomes ranging from grassland to forest that indicates an intrinsic system sensitivity to water availability across rainfall regimes, regardless of hydroclimatic conditions. We found higher WUEe in drier years that increased significantly with drought to a maximum WUEe across all biomes; and a minimum native state in wetter years that was common across hydroclimatic periods. This indicates biome-scale resilience to the interannual variability associated with the early twenty-first century drought-that is, the capacity to tolerate low, annual precipitation and to respond to subsequent periods of favourable water balance. These findings provide a conceptual model of ecosystem properties at the decadal scale applicable to the widespread altered hydroclimatic conditions that are predicted for later this century. Understanding the hydroclimatic threshold that will break down ecosystem resilience and alter maximum WUEe may allow us to predict land-surface consequences as large regions become more arid, starting with water-limited, low-productivity grasslands.},

How animals and plants can adapt to these altered environments via contemporary evolution is thus of strong interest. We discuss how to use genetic monitoring to study adaptive responses via repeated analysis of the same populations over time, distinguishing between phenotypic and molecular genetics approaches. After describing monitoring designs, we develop explicit criteria for demonstrating adaptive responses, which include testing for selection and establishing clear links between genetic and environmental change. We then review a few exemplary studies that explore adaptive responses to climate change in Drosophila, selective responses to hunting and fishing, and contemporary evolution in Daphnia using resurrected resting eggs. We further review a broader set of 44 studies to assess how well they meet the proposed criteria, and conclude that only 23\% fulfill all criteria. Approximately half (43\%) of these studies failed to rule out the alternative hypothesis of replacement by a different, better-adapted population. Likewise, 34\% of the studies based on phenotypic variation did not test for selection as opposed to drift. These shortcomings can be addressed via improved experimental designs and statistical testing. We foresee monitoring of adaptive responses as a future valuable tool in conservation biology, for identifying populations unable to evolve at sufficiently high rates and for identifying possible donor populations for genetic rescue. Technological advances will further augment the realization of this potential, especially next-generation sequencing technologies that allow for monitoring at the level of whole genomes.},

I found that a land snail Satsuma caliginosa of populations coexisting with a snail-eating snake Pareas iwasakii survived the snake predation by autotomizing its foot, whereas those out of the snake range rarely survived. Regeneration of a lost foot completed in a few weeks but imposed a delay of shell growth. Imprints of autotomy were found in greater than 10 per cent of S. caliginosa in the snake range but in only less than 1 per cent out of it, simultaneously demonstrating intense predation by the snakes and high efficiency of autotomy for surviving snake predation in the wild. However, in experiments, mature S. caliginosa performed autotomy less frequently. Instead of the costly autotomy, they can use defensive denticles on the inside of their shell apertures. Owing to the constraints from the additive growth of shells, most pulmonate snails can produce these denticles only when they have fully grown up. Thus, this developmental constraint limits the availability of the modified aperture, resulting in ontogenetic switching of the alternative defences. This study illustrates how costs of adaptation operate in the evolution of life-history strategies under developmental constraints},

Recently, this conceptual structure has been criticized on the grounds that flowers attract a broader spectrum of visitors than one might expect based on their syndromes and that flowers often diverge without excluding one type of pollinator in favor of another. Despite these criticisms, we show that pollination syndromes provide great utility in understanding the mechanisms of floral diversification. Our conclusions are based on the importance of organizing pollinators into functional groups according to presumed similarities in the selection pressures they exert. Furthermore, functional groups vary widely in their effectiveness as pollinators for particular plant species. Thus, although a plant may be visited by several functional groups, the relative selective pressures they exert will likely be very different. We discuss various methods of documenting selection on floral traits. Our review of the literature indicates overwhelming evidence that functional groups exert different selection pressures on floral traits. We also discuss the gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie the evolution of pollination syndromes. In parlicular, we need more information about the relative importance of specific traits in pollination shifts, about what selective factors favor shifts between functional groups, about whether selection acts on traits independently or in combination, and about the role of history in pollination-syndrome evolution.},

Most of the studies on eco-evolutionary dynamics have been concerned with direct trophic interactions. However, community ecologists have shown that trait-mediated indirect effects play an important role in shaping the structure of natural communities. In particular, in terrestrial plant-insect systems, indirect effects mediated through herbivore-induced plant responses are common and have a great impact on the structure of herbivore communities. This review describes eco-evolutionary dynamics in herbivorous insect communities, and specifically focuses on the key role of herbivore-induced plant responses in eco-evolutionary dynamics. First, I review studies on the evolution of herbivore traits relevant to plant induction and discuss evolution in a community context mediated by induced plant responses. Second, I highlight how intraspecific genetic variation or evolution in herbivore traits can influence herbivore community structure. Finally, I propose the hypothetical model that induced plant responses supports eco-evolutionary feedback in herbivore communities. In this review, I argue that the application of the indirect interaction web approaches into studies on eco-evolutionary will provide profound insights into understanding of mechanisms of the generation and maintenance of biodiversity.},

We investigate the sensitivity of the asymptotic growth rate to the demographic parameters of the model, the system size, and the connections between the patches.

Nested patterns are those in which the species composition of small assemblages is a nested subset of larger assemblages. For species interaction networks such as plant-pollinator webs, nestedness analysis has also proven a valuable tool for revealing ecological and evolutionary constraints. Despite this popularity, there has been substantial controversy in the literature over the best methods to define and quantify nestedness, and how to test for patterns of nestedness against an appropriate statistical null hypothesis. Here we review this rapidly developing literature and provide suggestions and guidelines for proper analyses. We focus on the logic and the performance of different metrics and the proper choice of null models for statistical inference. We observe that traditional 'gap-counting' metrics are biased towards species loss among columns (occupied sites) and that many metrics are not invariant to basic matrix properties. The study of nestedness should be combined with an appropriate gradient analysis to infer possible causes of the observed presence-absence sequence. In our view, statistical inference should be based on a null model in which row and columns sums are fixed. Under this model, only a relatively small number of published empirical matrices are significantly nested. We call for a critical reassessment of previous studies that have used biased metrics and unconstrained null models for statistical inference.},

We find that the vagrancy indices do not simply reflect individual abundance, suggesting an innate component to mobility. The vagrancy indices agree closely for the two data sets. They also correlate highly with a migration index, based on distances over which species have been recorded moving during the last 50 yr, indicating that frequency of movement corresponds closely with migration distances of species. The frequency of movement in some species, as measured by the vagrancy indices, is shown to be under-recorded, particularly nymphalids. In other species (e.g. Celastrina argiolus, Anthocharis cardamines, Pyronia tithonus) according to vagrancy indices, migration distances seem to have been previously under-recorded.

	abstract = {Aim To relate variation in the migration capacity and colonization ability of island communities to island geography and species island occupancy. Location Islands off mainland Britain and Ireland. Methods Mean migration (transfer) capacity and colonization (establishment) ability (ecological indices), indexed from 12 ecological variables for 56 butterfly species living on 103 islands, were related to species nestedness, island and mainland source geography and indices using linear regression models, RLQ analysis and fourth-corner analysis. Random creation of faunas from source species, rank correlation and rank regression were used to examine differences between island and source ecological indices, and relationships to island geography. Results Island butterfly faunas are highly nested. The two ecological indices related closely to island occupancy, nestedness rank of species, island richness and geography. The key variables related to migration capacity were island area and isolation; for colonization ability they were area, isolation and longitude. Compared with colonization ability, migration capacity was found to correlate more strongly with island species occupancy and species richness. For island faunas, the means for both ecological indices decreased, and variation increased, with increasing island species richness. Mean colonization ability and migration capacity values were significantly higher for island faunas than for mainland source faunas, but these differences decreased with island latitude. Main conclusions The nested pattern of butterfly species on islands off mainland Britain and Ireland relates strongly to colonization ability but especially to migration capacity. Differences in colonization ability among species are most obvious for large, topographically varied islands. Generalists with abundant multiple resources and greater migration capacity are found on all islands, whereas specialists are restricted to large islands with varied and long-lived biotopes, and islands close to shore. The inference is that sourcesink dynamics dominate butterfly distributions on British and Irish islands; species are capable of dispersing to new areas, but, with the exception of large and northern islands, facilities (resources) for permanent colonization are limited. The pattern of colonization ability and migration capacity is likely to be repeated for mainland areas, where such indices should provide useful independent measures for assessing the conservation status of faunas within spatial units.},

Larvae were released at the side-channel inlet and sampled at points 100, 500, 900, and 1,300 in downstream. Larvae drifted primarily near the riverbed, as 58-79\% of recaptured shovelnose sturgeon and 63-89\% of recaptured pallid sturgeon were sampled in the lower 0.5 m of the water column. The transition from the drifting to the benthic life stage was initiated at 6 dph (mean length, 15.6 mm) for shovelnose sturgeon and at 11-17 dph (mean length, 18.1-20.3 mm) for pallid sturgeon. Across ages, the drift rates of larval shovelnose sturgeon averaged 0.09-0.16 m/s slower than the mean water column velocity. The drift rates of pallid sturgeon were similar to or slightly slower (0.03-0.07 m/s) than the mean water column velocity for 1-11-dph larvae. Conversely, 17-dph larval pallid sturgeon dispersed downstream at a much slower rate (mean, 0.20 m/s slower than the mean water column velocity) owing to their transition to benthic habitats. Drift simulations indicated that the average larval shovelnose sturgeon may drift from 94 to 250 kin and the average larval pallid sturgeon may drift from 245 to 530 km, depending on water velocity. Differences in larval drift dynamics between species provide a possible explanation for differences in recruitment between shovelnose sturgeon and pallid sturgeon in the upper Missouri River.},

	abstract = {A central challenge for predators is achieving positive energy balance when prey are spatially and temporally heterogeneous. Ecological heterogeneity produces evolutionary trade-offs in the physiological design of predators; this is because the ability to capitalize on pulses of food abundance requires high capacity for food-processing, yet maintaining such capacity imposes energetic costs that are taxing during periods of food scarcity(1,2). Recent advances in physiology show that when variation in foraging opportunities is predictable, animals may adjust energetic tradeoffs by rapidly modulating their digestive system to track variation in foraging opportunities(1). However, it is increasingly recognized that foraging opportunities for animals are unpredictable(3), which should favour animals that maintain a capacity for food-processing that exceeds average levels of consumption (loads)(2,4). Despite this basic principle of quantitative evolutionary design, estimates of digestive load: capacity ratios in wild animals are virtually nonexistent(1). Here we provide an extensive assessment of load: capacity ratios for the digestive systems of predators in the wild, compiling 639 estimates across 38 species of fish. We found that piscine predators typically maintain the physiological capacity to feed at daily rates 2-3 times higher than what they experience on average. A numerical simulation of the trade-off between food-processing capacity and metabolic cost suggests that the observed level of physiological opportunism is profitable only if predator-prey encounters, and thus predator energy budgets, are far more variable in nature than currently assumed.},

	abstract = {To better understand the evolutionary and ecological effects of dispersal, there is growing emphasis on the need to integrate direct data on movement behaviour into landscape-scale analyses. However, little is known about the general link between movement behaviour and large-scale patterns of dispersal and gene flow. Likewise, although recent studies suggest that nonrandom, directionally biased movement and dispersal can promote evolutionary divergence, the generality of this mechanism is unknown. We test the hypothesis that directionally biased movement and dispersal by plethodontid salamanders interact with the topography of headwater areas to affect genetic and phenotypic divergence. Movements by Gyrinophilus porphyriticus and Eurycea bislineata show contrasting directional biases: upstream bias in G. porphyriticus and downstream bias in E. bislineata. Consistent with predictions of how these biases interact with slope to affect dispersal and gene flow, genetic distance increased with slope in G. porphyriticus and decreased with slope in E. bislineata over a standardized distance of 1 km along six headwater streams. In both species, phenotypic divergence in relative trunk length was positively related to genetic divergence. These results indicate that landscape-scale patterns of dispersal and gene flow are closely related to movement behaviour in G. porphyriticus and E. bislineata, and underscore the value of information on movement behaviour for predicting and interpreting patterns of dispersal and gene flow in complex landscapes. This study also provides new evidence that directionally biased movement and dispersal can be important sources of intra- and interspecific variation in population divergence, and highlights the value of explicit, a priori predictions in landscape genetic studies.},

The wide tree had fewer exceedances of carrying capacity, higher final number of individuals per community, and greater community (alpha) diversity than the high tree. The difference in diversity increased with increasing dispersal rate. We infer that the greater connectivity of the wide tree facilitated more even spatial dispersal, which limited carrying capacity exceedances and associated random deletions, which, in turn, resulted in higher diversity.

We applied this framework to faunal succession, including differential colonization between active and passive dispersers, and the nested patterns generated as a consequence of this peculiarity. Nine man-made wetlands located in three different areas, from 0-3 years from wetland creation, were assessed. In addition, 91 wetlands distributed throughout the region were used as references for natural macroinvertebrate communities. We predicted the following: (1) highly nested structures in pioneering assemblages will decrease to lower mid-term values due to a shift from active pioneering taxa to passive disperser ones; (2) passive idiosyncratic taxa will elicit divergent successional trajectories among areas; (3) the divergent trajectories will provoke lower local and higher regional diversity values in the mid-term assemblages than in pioneer assemblages. Our results were largely congruent with hypotheses (1) and (2), diverging from the anticipated patterns only in the case of the temporary wetlands area. However, overall diversity trends based on hypothesis (3) did not follow the expected pattern. The divergent successional trajectories did not compensate for regional biodiversity losses that occurred as a consequence of pioneering colonizer decline over time. Consequently, we suggest reconsidering wetland construction for mitigation purposes within mid-term time frames (a parts per thousand currency sign3 years). Wetlands may not offset, within this temporal scenario, regional biodiversity loss because the ecosystem may not support idiosyncratic taxa from natural wetlands.},

Recently, it has been emphasized that phenotypic plasticity, such as induced plant responses, has the potential to lead to evolutionary changes of interacting partners. Here, we report that induced plant regrowth promotes a locally adaptive feeding preference of a leaf beetle, Plagiodera versicolora. We found that there was among-population variation in the strength of the feeding preference of the leaf beetle for leaf-age types of conspecific host plants. The strength of the preference was positively correlated to leaf production of host plants across populations, and the intensity of induced regrowth was likely to have been responsible for geographic variation in new leaf production. Within one population, we detected a significant additive genetic variance and heritability in the preference for consuming new vs. old leaves. Moreover, the strength of preference was significantly related to egg production depending on the leaf-age types. Thus, allopatric populations can evolutionarily develop different adaptive preference, according to locally distinct patterns of induced host regrowth.},

For fishes with relatively small-bodied larvae, drift has the potential to play a more important role than active habitat selection in determining larval dispersal; therefore, we expect small-bodied fish larvae to be poorly associated with habitat characteristics. To test this hypothesis, we used as model yellow perch (Perca flavescens), whose larvae are among the smallest among freshwater temperate fishes. Thus, we analysed the habitat association of yellow perch larvae at multiple spatial scales in a large shallow fluvial lake by explicitly modelling directional (e. g. due to water currents) and non-directional (e. g. due to aggregation) spatial patterns. This allowed us to indirectly assess the relative roles of drift (directional process) and potential habitat choice on larval dispersal. Our results give weak support to the drift hypothesis, whereas yellow perch show a strong habitat association at unexpectedly small sizes, when compared to other systems. We found consistent non-directional patterns in larvae distributions at both broad and medium spatial scales but only few significant directional components. The environmental variables alone (e. g. vegetation) generally explained a significant and biologically relevant fraction of the variation in fish larvae distribution data. These results suggest that (i) drift plays a minor role in this shallow system, (ii) larvae display spatial patterns that only partially covary with environmental variables, and (iii) larvae are associated to specific habitats. By suggesting that habitat association potentially includes an active choice component for yellow perch larvae, our results shed new light on the ecology of freshwater fish larvae and should help in building more realistic recruitment models.},

Selected mussel beds in 8 rivers were surveyed at similar to 10 yr intervals between 1984 and 2007. Observed changes in mussel density (1996-2007) ranged from -50 to +55\%. These may be due to the effects of pearl fishing activity, sampling bias, and, to a lesser extent, habitat degradation. Marked differences between size distributions and corresponding age distributions were observed. Large mussels ({\textgreater}50 mm shell length L) were predominant at every site, although evidence of recent recruitment (mussels {\textless}30 mm L and/or aged {\textless}5 yr) was observed in each population. Based on the relative abundance of juvenile mussels observed, medium-term stability is indicated in 4 populations. One large population appeared to have localised recruitment problems, as relatively few juveniles were found at one site but larger numbers were found in other parts of the river. Three smaller populations had very few juveniles and appeared to be recruiting at historically low levels. Continued monitoring of these sites every decade will provide valuable information about the population dynamics of long-lived freshwater mussels.},

There have been very few attempts to develop valid spatial covariance models that incorporate flow, stream distance, or both. The application of typical spatial autocovariance functions based on Euclidean distance, such as the spherical covariance model, are not valid when using stream distance. In this paper we develop a large class of valid models that incorporate flow and stream distance by using spatial moving averages. These methods integrate a moving average function, or kernel, against a white noise process. By running the moving average function upstream from a location, we develop models that use flow, and by construction they are valid models based on stream distance. We show that with proper weighting, many of the usual spatial models based on Euclidean distance have a counterpart for stream networks. Using sulfate concentrations from an example data set, the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS), we show that models using flow may be more appropriate than models that only use stream distance. For the MBSS data set, we use restricted maximum likelihood to fit a valid covariance matrix that uses flow and stream distance, and then we use this covariance matrix to estimate fixed effects and make kriging and block kriging predictions.},

While gamete production is correlated positively with body size, individual fertilization success may be a function of population density. Usually it is assumed that when high population density leads to reduced body size and gamete production, per capita zygote production is diminished. This field study of the sea urchin Diadema antillarum Philippi provides a test of this assumption. Three experiments were conducted to determine the effect of male spawning on fertilization success. In the first experiment, unfertilized eggs were placed in Nitex bags at three distances up and downstream from a spawning male. In the second experiment, unfertilized eggs were released and captured at three distances downstream from a sperm source. In both experiments, fertilized eggs were released and captured at three distances downstream from a sperm source. In both experiments, fertilization decreased with distance from the sperm source. The final experiment tested the influences of male size and population density on fertilization success; the effect of density was significant, but size was not. A simple model estimates the average number of zygotes produced by females of average size under different density regimes: at high population density, increased fertilization success can compensate for decreased gamete production. Small individuals at high population density may have similar per capita zygote production as large individuals at low population density. Thus, estimates of reproductive output based on body size or gamete production alone can be misleading.},

	abstract = {During the last 20 years, ecologists discovered the importance of including spatial relationships in models of species distributions. Among the latest developments in modelling how species are spatially structured are eigenfunction-based spatial filtering methods such as Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) and principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM). Although these methods are very powerful and flexible, they are only suited to study distributions resulting from non-directional spatial processes. The asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM) framework, a new eigenfunction-based spatial filtering method, fills this theoretical gap. AEM was specifically designed to model spatial structures hypothesized to be produced by directional spatial processes. Water currents, prevailing wind on mountainsides, river networks, and glaciations at historical time scales are some of the situations where AEM can be used. This paper presents three applications of the method illustrating different combinations of: sampling schemes (regular and irregular), data types (univariate and multivariate), and spatial scales (metres, kilometres, and hundreds of kilometres). The applications include the distribution of a crustacean (Atya) in a river, bacterial production in a lake, and the distribution of the copepodite stages of a crustacean on the Atlantic oceanic shelf. In each application, a comparison is made between AEM, MEM, and PCNM. No environmental components were included in the comparisons. AEM was a strong predictor in all cases, explaining 59.8\% for Atya distribution, 51.4\% of the bacterial production variation, and 38.4\% for the copepodite distributions. AEM outperformed MEM and PCNM in these applications, offering a powerful and more appropriate tool for spatial modelling of species distributions under directional forcing and leading to a better understanding of the processes at work in these systems.},

These patterns are likely to be influenced by the combination of temporally variable environmental conditions, movement constraints imposed by network structure, and the trait composition of local communities. We developed a simplified metacommunity model to investigate complex interactions among these factors under lottery competition for local resources, such as establishment sites. We used this model to examine how local and regional community composition varied in 3 scenarios: a null implementation involving only spatial effects, an implementation that combined network constraints with dispersal-trait variation, and an implementation in which a trade-off between multiple functional traits was paired with varying levels of temporal autocorrelation in the intensity of mortality. These simulations clarified the conditions that allow a single functional strategy to exclude others in a dendritic network and demonstrated 2 distinct modes of regional partitioning that can support the persistence of multiple functional strategies within such networks. The results suggested that the emergence of watershed or headwater-outlet partitioning depends on the functional dispersal differences present in the metacommunity and that autocorrelated mortality levels can collapse these regional divisions when they depend on a trade-off between dispersal ability and mortality resistance. We discuss the need to confront the complexity of interacting controls on community composition in rivers and streams and suggest opportunities to move beyond the basic framework we present.},

Viability can be drastically reduced when directional bias in dispersal strength is higher than 25\%. Re-colonization patterns that allow for strong local connectivity provide the highest persistence compared to systems that allow circulation.

This idea has been termed the 'unidirectional dispersal hypothesis' and is the genetic equivalent of the more generally known 'drift paradox'. Our aim was to test this unidirectional diversity hypothesis, and to present a general synthesis of the patterns of population genetic variation across different riparian and aquatic plant species along rivers. Location The Meuse River (Belgium) and rivers world-wide. Methods First, we used amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to compare patterns of within- and between-population genetic diversity among three riparian plant species (Sisymbrium austriacum, Erysimum cheiranthoides and Rorippa sylvestris), typically occurring in different habitats along a gradient perpendicular to the Meuse River. Second, we performed a meta-analysis on studies reporting on the population genetic structure of riparian and aquatic plant species along rivers. Results Along the Meuse River, we found significant genetic differentiation among populations of all three riparian species, and significant isolation by distance for one of them (R. sylvestris). There was no clear association between the typical habitat of a species and its population genetic structure. None of the three species provided evidence for the unidirectional dispersal hypothesis. The meta-analysis, based on 21 data records, did not support the unidirectional dispersal hypothesis either. Average weighted population genetic differentiation across species was significant. Main conclusions Important mechanisms of upstream seed dispersal, probably through zoochory, together with higher seed recruitment opportunities in upstream habitats due to density dependence of recruitment, may explain the absence of downstream accumulation of genetic diversity. Also, it seems difficult to find consistent patterns in genetic variation in species from aquatic and riparian habitats. We argue that this is due to the recurrent extinctions and colonizations characteristic of these habitats, resulting in complex genetic patterns. Our results strongly support previous suggestions that stream ecology should consistently embrace metapopulation theory to be able to understand patterns of genetic diversity, as well as species diversity.},

	abstract = {Hydrochory, or the passive dispersal of organisms by water, is an important means of propagule transport, especially for plants. During recent years, knowledge about hydrochory and its ecological consequences has increased considerably and a substantial body of literature has been produced. Here, we review this literature and define the state of the art of the discipline. A substantial proportion of species growing in or near water have propagules (fruits, seeds or vegetative units) able to disperse by water, either floating, submerged in flowing water, or with the help of floating vessels. Hydrochory can enable plants to colonize sites out of reach with other dispersal vectors, but the timing of dispersal and mechanisms of establishment are important for successful establishment. At the population level, hydrochory may increase the effective size and longevity of populations, and control their spatial configuration. Hydrochory is also an important source of species colonizing recruitment-limited riparian and wetland communities, contributing to maintenance of community species richness. Dispersal by water may even influence community composition in different landscape elements, resulting in landscape-level patterns. Genetically, hydrochory may reduce spatial aggregation of genetically related individuals, lead to high gene flow among populations, and increase genetic diversity in populations receiving many propagules. Humans have impacted hydrochory in many ways. For example, dams affect hydrochory by reducing peak flows and hence dispersal capacity, altering the timing of dispersal, and by presenting physical barriers to dispersal, with consequences for riverine plant communities. Hydrochory has been inferred to be an important vector for the spread of many invasive species, but there is also the potential for enhancing ecosystem restoration by improving or restoring water dispersal pathways. Climate change may alter the role of hydrochory by modifying the hydrology of water-bodies as well as conditions for propagule release and plant colonization.},

	abstract = {Sexual size dimorphism (SSD), a difference in body size between the sexes, occurs in many animal species. Although the larger sex is often considered invariable within species, patterns of selection may result in interpopulation variation or even reversal of SSD. We evaluated correlations between latitude and female body size, male body size, and relative body size (male body size/female body size) in 22 populations (ranging from 37 degrees N to 49 degrees N) of sea-run masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) that spawn in rivers along the Sea of Japan coast. Male size and the relative body size increased with latitude, but female size did not correlate with latitude. In addition, increase in male size with latitude was sufficient to result in a reversal of SSD, the switch-point being around 45 degrees N. We suggest that the positive correlation between latitude and male size is due to increasing operational sex ratios or sexual selection on sea-run male body size that result from sex-biased patterns of anadromy. In conclusion, our study provides the first example of predictable geographic variation in SSD shaped by apparent patterns of sexual selection.},

	abstract = {Despite the considerable evidence showing that dispersal between habitat patches is often asymmetric, most of the metapopulation models assume symmetric dispersal. In this paper, we develop a Monte Carlo simulation model to quantify the effect of asymmetric dispersal on metapopulation persistence. Our results suggest that metapopulation extinctions are more likely when dispersal is asymmetric. Metapopulation viability in systems with symmetric dispersal mirrors results from a mean field approximation, where the system persists if the expected per patch colonization probability exceeds the expected per patch local extinction rate. For asymmetric cases, the mean field approximation underestimates the number of patches necessary for maintaining population persistence. If we use a model assuming symmetric dispersal when dispersal is actually asymmetric, the estimation of metapopulation persistence is wrong in more than 50\% of the cases. Metapopulation viability depends on patch connectivity in symmetric systems, whereas in the asymmetric case the number of patches is more important. These results have important implications for managing spatially structured populations, when asymmetric dispersal may occur. Future metapopulation models should account for asymmetric dispersal, while empirical work is needed to quantify the patterns and the consequences of asymmetric dispersal in natural metapopulations.},

Determined by landscape structure as well as dispersal-related traits of species, connectivity influences various key aspects of population biology, ranging from population persistence to genetic structure and diversity. Here, we investigated differences in small-scale connectivity in terms of gene flow between populations of two ecologically important invertebrates with contrasting dispersal-related traits: an amphipod (Gammarus fossarum) with a purely aquatic life cycle and a mayfly (Baetis rhodani) with a terrestrial adult stage. 2. We used highly polymorphic markers to estimate genetic differentiation between populations of both species within a Swiss pre-alpine catchment and compared these results to the broader-scale genetic structure within the Rhine drainage. Landscape genetic approaches were used to test for correlations of genetic and geographical structures and in-stream barrier effects. 3. We found overall very weak genetic structure in populations of B. rhodani. In contrast, G. fossarum showed strong genetic differentiation, even at spatial scales of a few kilometres, and a clear pattern of isolation by distance. Genetic diversity decreased from downstream towards upstream populations of G. fossarum, suggesting asymmetric gene flow. Correlation of genetic structure with landscape topography was more pronounced in the amphipod. Our study also indicates that G. fossarum might be capable of dispersing overland in headwater regions and of crossing small in-stream barriers. 4. We speculate that differences in dispersal capacity but also habitat specialisation and potentially the extent of local adaptation could be responsible for the differences in genetic differentiation found between the two species. These results highlight the importance of taking into account dispersal-related traits when planning management and conservation strategies.},

We used ten microsatellite markers to investigate small-scale patterns of gene flow, current dispersal and neutral genetic diversity in a morphologically diverse river where fragmented and unfragmented sections could be compared. We found high genetic differentiation between sampling sites with a maximum F-ST of 0.32 between sites separated by only 35 km. A significant increase of genetic differentiation with geographical distance was observed in the continuous river section as well as in the full dataset which included headwater populations isolated by anthropogenic barriers. Several lines of evidence are consistent with the hypothesis that such barriers completely block upstream movement while downstream dispersal may be little affected. In the unfragmented habitat, dispersal rates were also higher in the direction of water flow than against it. The resulting asymmetry in gene flow likely contributes to the decrease of genetic variation observed from the lower reaches towards the headwaters, which is particularly pronounced in physically isolated populations. Our findings suggest that headwater populations, due to their isolation and low genetic variation, may be particularly vulnerable to extinction.},

A spatially nested sampling design showed that grouping populations according to high-elevation 'islands' of alpine tundra (which typically include headwater streams of {\textgreater} 1 watershed) explained a significant proportion of genetic variation while grouping streams according to major watershed (across islands) did not. Nested clade analysis and isolation-by-distance (IBD) relationships further implicated limited ongoing gene flow within but not among the isolated alpine islands. IBD was strong among five streams within an individual island using each of four alternative models of pairwise landscape connectivity for flying insects. Results of all landscape models were positively correlated, suggesting that straight-line distance is an acceptable surrogate for presumably more biologically meaningful connectivity measures in this system. IBD was significantly weaker across the entire study area, comprised of three separate islands. Overall, population structure was significant with F(ST) = 0.38, suggesting limited dispersal across a small spatial extent.},

We discuss three variants on the one-dimensional stepping stone model. Future research in linear environments should examine the expectations of these models.

Thermal variations also seem to influence the timing of reproduction within rivers, which can be delayed by several weeks during cold years. At least 3000degrees-days occur between annual episodes of glochidial release. 5. The timing of spawning is determined gradually, probably by a thermal summation effect. 6. The release stage occurs as a sudden, synchronised event, with most of the glochidia spat over 1-2 days, indicating that it is triggered by an environmental cue.

Current did not influence physiological parameters associated with smolting and was not found to initiate movement; movement was related to accumulated thermal units (ATU). The presence of a strong, directional current, however, resulted in a period of more defined movement, suggesting a possible influence of current once migration is underway. A combination of either photoperiod or ATU with gill Na(+),K(+)-ATPase was most strongly linked to movement.

	abstract = {Physiological and behavioral changes occur in the spring when juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. undergo smolting. Survival is maximized if the timing of these changes coincides with migration from fresh to marine environments. Therefore, understanding how environmental conditions influence the onset, duration, and termination of smolting can have substantial management implications, particularly for flow-controlled rivers. We used an information-theoretic model comparison analysis to investigate the roles of daily mean temperature, temperature experience (accumulated thermal units [ATU]), photoperiod, and flow on the timing of the downstream migration of Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha smolts from the Nechako River in central British Columbia. Both binary (migration or not) and count (the total number of migrants) models were developed that predicted the downstream migration of Chinook salmon based on data collected from fish captured at rotary-screw traps from 1992 to 2004. The analyses identified a combination of temperature experience, flow, and the number of spawners as best able to describe the observed migration patterns. In addition, increasing ATU had a positive influence on migration, while increasing flow had a negative influence. Temperature experience was found to have more influence on migration than daily mean temperature. The predictive ability of each model was tested with 2 years of independent data. The count model accurately predicted the general trends in migration and, in particular, the termination of migration, but not the daily fluctuations in movement. By contrast, the binary model predicted whether fish would migrate on a given day with accuracies of 93\% and 99\%, respectively, for the 2 years tested. Temperature experience was more strongly linked to migration than the daily or threshold temperature; warmer temperatures resulted in earlier migration. Our data suggest that flow plays an important role once migration is under way and may even serve as a termination cue. Furthermore, the number of migrants and the probability of migration was positively related to the number of spawners. Based on the results of this study, flow manipulations that change the timing, duration, or magnitude of temperature and flow in the spring could affect the migration of Chinook salmon. Both temperature and river flow should be considered when one is managing flow-controlled watersheds for salmon productivity.},

More than half (52.6\%, n = 1360) of the snails in our study were infected.

We used a transplant experiment, a mark-and-recapture experiment and stable carbon isotope ratios to reveal that snails infected by the trematode move to the lower intertidal zone, resume growth after maturation and consume different resources. By simultaneously changing the morphology and behaviour of individual hosts, this parasite alters the demographics and potentially modifies resource use of the snail population.

This phenomenon may be particularly true for the many parasites with complex life cycles, where various life stages require different host species. Homogenization of the world's biota through human-mediated invasions may reunite hosts and parasites, resulting in disease outbreaks in novel regions. Here we use molecular genetics to differentiate invasion pathways for two digenean trematode parasites and their exotic host, the Asian mud snail, Batillaria attramentaria. All of the snail haplotypes found in introduced populations in North America were identical to haplotypes common in the areas of Japan that provided oysters for cultivation in North America, supporting the hypothesis that the snails were introduced from Japan with seed oysters. Two cryptic trematode species were introduced to North American populations in high frequencies. We found a marked reduction of genetic variation in one of these species, suggesting it experienced a bottleneck or founder event comparable to that of the host snail. In contrast, no genetic variation was lost in the other parasite species. We hypothesize that this parasite was and is dispersed naturally by migratory shorebirds and was able to establish only after the host snail, B. attramentaria, was introduced to North America. Evaluation of the nature of invasion pathways and postinvasion consequences will aid mitigation of spreading diseases of humans, livestock, and wildlife in an increasingly globalized world.},

However, this method can be significantly biased by only a few highly diverged populations and lose the information of individual population. To detect outlier populations and investigate the relative strengths of gene flow and genetic drift for each population, we propose a decomposed pairwise regression analysis. This analysis was applied to the well-described one-dimensional stepping-stone system of stream-dwelling Dolly Varden charr (Salvelinus malma). When genetic and geographic distances were plotted for all pairs of 17 tributary populations, the correlation was significant but weak (r(2) = 0.184). Seven outlier populations were determined based on the systematic bias of the regression residuals, followed by Akaike's information criteria. The best model, 10 populations included, showed a strong pattern of isolation by distance (r(2) = 0.758), suggesting equilibrium between gene flow and genetic drift in these populations. Each outlier population was also analysed by plotting pairwise genetic and geographic distances against the 10 nonoutlier populations, and categorized into one of the three patterns: strong genetic drift, genetic drift with a limited gene flow and a high level of gene flow. These classifications were generally consistent with a priori predictions for each population (physical barrier, population size, anthropogenic impacts). Combined the genetic analysis with field observations, Dolly Varden in this river appeared to form a mainland-island or source-sink metapopulation structure. The generality of the method will merit many types of spatial genetic analyses.},

	abstract = {1. Unionid mussels are highly threatened, but little is known about genetic structure in populations of these organisms. We used allozyme electrophoresis to examine partitioning of genetic variation in three locally abundant and widely distributed species of mussels from a catchment in Ohio. 2. Within-population variation was similar to that previously reported for freshwater mussels, but genotype frequencies exhibited heterozygote deficiencies in many instances. All three species exhibited significant among-population variation. Evidence of isolation-by-distance was found in Elliptio dilatata and Ptychobranchus fasciolaris, while Lampsilis siliquoidea showed no geographical pattern of among-population variation. 3. Our results suggest that the isolating effects of genetic drift were greater in L. siliquoidea than in the other species. Differentiation of populations occurred at a much smaller spatial scale than has previously been found in freshwater mussels. Differences among species may reflect differences in the dispersal abilities of fishes that serve as hosts for the glochidia larvae of mussels. 4. Based on our results, we hypothesise that species of mussels that are common to large rivers exhibit relatively large amounts of within-population genetic variation and little differentiation over large geographical distances. Conversely, species typical of small streams show lower within-population genetic variation and populations will be more isolated. If this hypothesis can be supported, it may prove useful in the design of conservation strategies that maintain the genetic structure of target species.},

The objective was to examine potential influences of both local watershed characteristics and larger-scale processes in the marine environment on smolt migration patterns. Multivariate analyses demonstrated a strong latitudinal gradient in migration patterns with trends toward later, shorter, and more predictable migrations with increasing latitude. Cluster analysis performed on migration descriptors indicated three major population groupings that coincide with major coastal oceanic regions in the northeast Pacific: a northern group from Kodiak Island to the Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia, a central group from the Queen Charlotte Islands south to the Columbia River, and a southern group from the Columbia River southward. These regional patterns transcended local variability associated with watershed characteristics and trap location, suggesting that the patterns reflect adaptation to differences in timing and relative predictability of favorable conditions in the marine environments that smolts enter.},

	abstract = {Despite the importance of habitat in determining species distribution and persistence, habitat dynamics are rarely modeled in studies of metapopulations. We used an integrated habitat-occupancy model to simultaneously quantify habitat change, site fidelity, and local colonization and extinction rates for larvae of a suite of Great Plains stream fishes in the Arikaree River, eastern Colorado, USA, across three years. Sites were located along a gradient of flow intermittency and groundwater connectivity. Hydrology varied across years: the first and third being relatively wet and the second dry. Despite hydrologic variation, our results indicated that site suitability was random from one year to the next. Occupancy probabilities were also independent of previous habitat and occupancy state for most species, indicating little site fidelity. Climate and groundwater connectivity were important drivers of local extinction and colonization, but the importance of groundwater differed between periods. Across species, site extinction probabilities were highest during the transition from wet to dry conditions (range: 0.52-0.98), and the effect of groundwater was apparent with higher extinction probabilities for sites not fed by groundwater. Colonization probabilities during this period were relatively low for both previously dry sites (range: 0.02-0.38) and previously wet sites (range: 0.02-0.43). In contrast, no sites dried or remained dry during the transition from dry to wet conditions, yielding lower but still substantial extinction probabilities (range: 0.16-0.63) and higher colonization probabilities (range: 0.06-0.86), with little difference among sites with and without groundwater. This approach of jointly modeling both habitat change and species occupancy will likely be useful to incorporate effects of dynamic habitat on metapopulation processes and to better inform appropriate conservation actions.},

Freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera L.) populations are seriously declining all over Europe and a variety of conservation programs are being established to support the remaining endangered central European populations. In order to provide guidelines for conservation strategies and management programs, we investigated the genetic structure of 24 freshwater pearl mussel populations originating from five major central European drainages including Elbe, Danube, Rhine, Maas and Weser, representing the last and most important populations in this area. We present a nondestructive sampling method of haemolymph for DNA analyses, which is applicable for endangered bivalves. The analyses of nine microsatellite loci with different levels of polymorphism revealed a high degree of fragmented population structure and very different levels of genetic diversity within populations. These patterns can be explained by historical and demographic effects and have been enforced by anthropogenic activities. Even within drainages, distinct conservation units were detected, as revealed from high F-ST values, private alleles and genetic distance measures. Populations sampled close to contact zones between main drainage systems showed lowest levels of correct assignment to present-day drainage systems. Populations with high priority for conservation should not only be selected by means of census population size and geographical distance to other populations. Instead, detailed genetic analyses are mandatory for revealing differentiation and diversity parameters, which should be combined with ecological criteria for sustainable conservation and recovery programs.},

Our data further suggest that some effects on the belowground food web were attributable to changes in aboveground plant nutrients and biomass, which were themselves related to reduced soil disturbance and fertility on invaded islands. These results demonstrate that, by disrupting across-ecosystem nutrient subsidies, predators can indirectly induce strong shifts in both above- and below-ground biota via multiple pathways, and in doing so, act as major ecosystem drivers.},

I found that the preference of weevils for the plant fruit based on pericarp thickness varied across 13 populations in Japan. Importantly, variation in weevil behaviour explained interpopulation variation in pericarp thickness and the direction/ strength of natural selection on the trait.

The sizes of the plant defensive apparatus (pericarp thickness) and the weevil offensive apparatus (rostrum length) clearly correlated with each other across populations. Nevertheless, the balance in armaments between the two species was geographically structured. In the populations for which the balance was relatively advantageous for the plant's defense, natural selection on the trait was stronger because in the other populations, most plant individuals were too vulnerable to resist the attacks of the weevil, and their seeds were infested independent of pericarp thickness. We also found that the imbalance between the defensive/offensive armaments and the intensity of natural selection showed clear latitudinal clines. Overall, our results suggest that the imbalance of armament between sympatric prey and predator could determine the strength of local selection and that climatic conditions could affect the local and overall trajectory of coevolutionary arms races.},

One unexplored cause is the history of community assembly, the partly stochastic sequential arrival of species from a regional pool of potential community members. The sequence of species arrival can greatly affect community structure(15-19). If assembly sequence interacts with productivity to influence diversity, different sequences can contribute to variation in productivity-diversity relationships. Here we report a test of this hypothesis by assembling aquatic microbial communities at five productivity levels using four assembly sequences. About 30 generations after assembly, productivity-diversity relationships took various forms, including a positive, a hump-shaped, a U-shaped and a non-significant pattern, depending on assembly sequence. This variation resulted from idiosyncratic joint effects of assembly sequence, productivity and species identity on species abundances. We suggest that the history of community assembly should be added to the growing list of factors that influence productivity-biodiversity patterns.},

	abstract = {Rapid growth in response to increased prey abundance may be induced by environmental variability associated with resource subsidies. Spiders living in riparian areas are subject to frequent, episodic bursts of aquatic prey (subsidies). These periods of high resource abundance may occur at different points in recipient consumers' development through variation in emergence patterns of prey between years or across a landscape. We examine how variable timing of subsidy abundance intersects with life history scheduling to produce different growth and development outcomes for individuals within a population. Through a series of controlled feeding experiments, we tested the hypotheses that the spider Tetragnatha versicolor: (1) exhibits compensatory growth in response to subsidy variability, (2) that rapid increases in mass may result in a greater risk of mortality, and (3) that the timing of subsidy resources relative to the development schedule of this spider may produce different outcomes for individual growth patterns and adult condition. Spiders fed at very high rates grew fastest but also showed evidence of increased mortality risk during moulting. T. versicolor is capable of exhibiting strong growth compensation - individuals suffering initial growth restriction were able to catch up completely with animals on a constant diet utilising the same amount of food. Spiders that received an early pulse of resources (simulating an early arrival of an aquatic insect subsidy to riparian forests) did worse on all measures of development and fitness than spiders that received either a constant supply of food or a late pulse of resources. Importantly, receiving large amounts of food early in life appears to actually confer relative disadvantages in terms of later performance compared with receiving subsidies later in development. Subsidies may provide greater benefits to individuals or age cohorts encountering this resource abundance closer to the onset of reproductive efforts than subsidies arriving early in development.},

This subsidy has been hypothesized to be of little importance where the primary productivity of the recipient habitat exceeds that of the donor habitat. 2. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated emerging stream insect abundance in a productive riparian rainforest in a replicated design using greenhouse-type exclosures, contrasted with unmanipulated stream reaches (four exclosures on two streams). 3. Experimental exclosures resulted in a 62.9\% decrease in aquatic insect abundance in exclusion reaches compared with control reaches. The overall density of riparian spiders was significantly positively correlated with aquatic insect abundances. Horizontal orb weavers (Tetragnathidae) showed a strong response to aquatic insect reduction - abundance at exclosure sites was 57\% lower than at control sites. Several spider families that have not been associated with tracking aquatic insect subsidies also showed significantly decreased abundance when aquatic insects were reduced. 4. This result is contrary to predictions of weak subsidy effects where recipient net primary productivity is high. These results suggest that predicting the importance of resource subsidies for food webs requires a focus on the relative abundance of subsidy materials in recipient and donor habitats and not simply on the total flux of energy between systems.},

In this article, we discuss extending the conventional pairwise concept and demonstrate a community module-based approach as an initial step for exploring community consequences of species-specific phenological shifts caused by climate change. Our multispecies match/mismatch perspective leads to the prediction that phenological (a)synchrony among interacting species critically affects not only population recruitment of species but also key dynamical features of ecological communities such as trophic cascades, competitive hierarchies, and species coexistence. Explicit identification and consideration of species relationships is therefore desirable for a better understanding of seasonal community dynamics and thus community consequences of climate change-induced phenological shifts.},

In this study of thirty-five benthic insect taxa at fifty-four tributary sites of the Taieri River on the South Island of New Zealand, we chose as the temporal axis the intensity/frequency of disturbance, defined in terms of bed movement during high discharge events. As the spatial axis, we postulated that three features would provide refugia and therefore ameliorate disturbance-percentage of the bed with low shear stress, percentage of the bed made up of large substratum particles and availability of interstitial space in the bed-from which we derived a combined multivariate refugium axis. 3. More disturbed communities contained a significantly higher percentage of individuals possessing the following traits: small size, high adult mobility, habitat generalist (each predicted to confer resilience in response to disturbance), clinger, streamlined/flattened and with two or more life stages outside the stream (each predicted to confer resistance in the face of disturbance). When analyses were performed on the percentage of taxa having particular traits, the predicted positive relationships with average bed movement were found for high adult mobility and habitat generalist traits. 4. The percentage of variance in trait scores explained by intensity of disturbance was generally higher in sites with less refugia available and lower in sites further from the headwaters. The percentage of variance explained was higher in sites recently subject to a major high discharge disturbance, suggesting that disturbances tend to strengthen the pattern of preponderance of resilience/resistance traits. 5. We mapped insect taxa onto the two-dimensional templet, following Grime et al.'s triangular terrestrial plant classification. The full variety of resistance and resilience traits were represented in insect species throughout the templet, but taxa associated with more disturbed conditions generally displayed a larger number of resilience and resistance traits, combined, than taxa associated with more stable stream beds.},

However, a recent stochastic model combining the main elements of niche theory and island biogeography theory suggests that environmental heterogeneity has a general unimodal rather than a positive effect on species richness. This result was explained by an inherent tradeoff between environmental heterogeneity and the amount of suitable area available for individual species: for a given area, as heterogeneity increases, the amount of effective area available for individual species decreases, thereby reducing population sizes and increasing the likelihood of stochastic extinctions. Here we provide a comprehensive evaluation of this hypothesis. First we analyze an extensive database of breeding bird distribution in Catalonia and show that patterns of species richness, species abundance, and extinction rates are consistent with the predictions of the area-heterogeneity tradeoff and its proposed mechanisms. We then perform a metaanalysis of heterogeneity-diversity relationships in 54 published datasets and show that empirical data better fit the unimodal pattern predicted by the area-heterogeneity tradeoff than the positive pattern predicted by classic niche theory. Simulations in which species may have variable niche widths along a continuous environmental gradient are consistent with all empirical findings. The area-heterogeneity tradeoff brings a unique perspective to current theories of species diversity and has important implications for biodiversity conservation.},

We investigated how the abundance of a dominant ecosystem engineer, spawning sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), alters the emergence phenology of stream insects. In streams with high densities of salmon, peak insect emergence occurred in early July, immediately prior to salmon spawning. By contrast, peak insect emergence in streams with low densities of salmon was weeks later and more protracted. The emergence of specific taxa was also significantly related to salmon density. A common rearing experiment revealed that differences in emergence timing are maintained in the absence of spawning salmon. We hypothesize that these patterns are probably driven by predictable and severe disturbance from nest-digging salmon driving local adaptation and being a trait filter of insect emergence. Thus, salmon regulate the timing and duration of aquatic insect emergence, a cross-ecosystem flux from streams to riparian systems.},

New spatial statistical models that account for network topology were parameterized with these data and explained 93\% and 86\% of the variation in mean stream temperatures and maximas, respectively. During our study period, basin average mean stream temperatures increased by 0.38 degrees C (0.27 degrees C/decade), and maximas increased by 0.48 degrees C (0.34 degrees C/decade), primarily due to long-term (30-50 year) trends in air temperatures and stream flows. Radiation increases from wildfires accounted for 9\% of basin-scale temperature increases, despite burning 14\% of the basin. Within wildfire perimeters, however, stream temperature increases were 2-3 times greater than basin averages, and radiation gains accounted for 50\% of warming. Thermal habitat for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was minimally affected by temperature increases, except for small shifts towards higher elevations. Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), in contrast, were estimated to have lost 11-20\% (8-16\%/decade) of the headwater stream lengths that were cold enough for spawning and early juvenile rearing, with the largest losses occurring in the coldest habitats. Our results suggest that a warming climate has begun to affect thermal conditions in streams and that impacts to biota will be specific to both species and context. Where species are at risk, conservation actions should be guided based on considerations of restoration opportunity and future climatic effects. To refine predictions based on thermal effects, more work is needed to understand mechanisms associated with biological responses, climate effects on other habitat features, and habitat configurations that confer population resilience.},

Today, climate change is among the most serious threats to global biodiversity. Although many studies have revealed phenological responses to climate change, no long-term community-level indices have been developed. We derived a 250-year index of first flowering dates for 405 plant species in the UK for assessing the impact of climate change on plant communities. The estimated community-level index in the most recent 25 years was 2.2-12.7 days earlier than any other consecutive 25-year period since 1760. The index was closely correlated with February-April mean Central England Temperature, with flowering 5.0 days earlier for every 1 degrees C increase in temperature. The index was relatively sensitive to the number of species, not records per species, included in the model. Our results demonstrate how multi-species, multiple-site phenological events can be integrated to obtain indices showing trends for each species and across species. This index should play an important role in monitoring the impact of climate change on biodiversity. Furthermore, this approach can be extended to incorporate data from other taxa and countries for evaluating cross-taxa and cross-country phenological responses to climate change.},

The thermal regime of rivers plays an important role in the overall health of aquatic ecosystems, including water quality issues and the distribution of aquatic species within the river environment. Consequently, for conducting environmental impact assessments as well as for effective fisheries management, it is important to understand the thermal behaviour of rivers and related heat exchange processes. 2. This study reviews the different river thermal processes responsible for water temperature variability on both the temporal (e.g. diel, daily, seasonal) and spatial scales, as well as providing information related to different water temperature models currently found in the literature. 3. Water temperature models are generally classified into three groups: regression, stochastic and deterministic models. Deterministic models employ an energy budget approach to predict river water temperature, whereas regression and stochastic models generally rely on air to water temperature relationships. 4. Water temperature variability can occur naturally or as a result of anthropogenic perturbations, such as thermal pollution, deforestation, flow modification and climate change. Literature information is provided on the thermal regime of rivers in relation to anthropogenic impacts and such information will contribute to the better protection of fish habitat and more efficient fisheries management.},

To determine whether all populations responded similarly to climate, we used a cluster analysis to group populations that had similar annual fluctuations in survival. The populations grouped into four clusters, and different environmental factors were important for different clusters. 4. Survival in two of the clusters was negatively correlated with summer temperature, and survival in the other two clusters was positively correlated with minimum fall stream flow, which in turn depends on snow pack from the previous winter. 5. Using classification and regression tree analysis, we identified stream width and stream temperature as key habitat factors that shape the responses of individual populations to climate. 6.

Predicting the effects of projected stream warming in stream networks is complicated by the generally poor correlation between water temperature and air temperature. Spatial dependencies in stream networks are complex because the geography of stream processes is governed by dimensions of flow direction and network structure. Therefore, forecasting climate-driven range shifts of stream biota has lagged behind similar terrestrial modeling efforts. We predicted climate-induced changes in summer thermal habitat for 3 cold-water fish speciesjuvenile Chinook salmon, rainbow trout, and bull trout (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, O. mykiss, and Salvelinus confluentus, respectively)in the John Day River basin, northwestern United States. We used a spatially explicit statistical model designed to predict water temperature in stream networks on the basis of flow and spatial connectivity. The spatial distribution of stream temperature extremes during summers from 1993 through 2009 was largely governed by solar radiation and interannual extremes of air temperature. For a moderate climate change scenario, estimated declines by 2100 in the volume of habitat for Chinook salmon, rainbow trout, and bull trout were 6995\%, 5187\%, and 86100\%, respectively. Although some restoration strategies may be able to offset these projected effects, such forecasts point to how and where restoration and management efforts might focus.},

	abstract = {Spatial and temporal heterogeneity interact to make the foraging rates of individuals more variable than expected from models assuming that spatial and temporal dimensions of habitat conditions operate independently. For example, trophic resource pulses produce temporal patches of prey superabundance, yet little is known about how spatial heterogeneity in habitat conditions mediates the ability of consumers to exploit these high-quality foraging opportunities. We studied how spatial variation in water temperature regulates the potential for juvenile coho salmon to exploit a seasonal pulsed subsidy of eggs produced by anadromous sockeye salmon. Streams within the Wood River watershed, southwestern Alaska, USA, ranged in mean summer temperature from 3.6 degrees to 14.5 degrees C. Growth of juvenile coho prior to the arrival of the seasonal egg subsidy was positively related to water temperature among streams. An in situ experiment combined with field samples of diets revealed a size threshold for egg consumption; only individuals longer than similar to 70 mm could consume eggs due to gape limitation of smaller individuals. A bioenergetics simulation demonstrated that water temperature regulated whether age-0 coho salmon could grow large enough to exceed the size threshold for egg consumption. Coho salmon that consumed eggs had energy rations that were five times higher than fish that did not consume eggs, resulting in a positive feedback of water temperature on their integrated seasonal growth. Across this landscape, heterogeneity in water temperature mediates individual- and population-level responses to seasonally available resource pulses. Our study illustrates that ecological mechanisms, such as size-based foraging asymmetries, can magnify the effects of climate change compared to predictions based on physiology alone.},

	abstract = {Habitat heterogeneity can generate intraspecific diversity through local adaptation of populations. While it is becoming increasingly clear that population diversity can increase stability in species abundance, less is known about how population diversity can benefit consumers that can integrate across population diversity in their prey. Here we demonstrate cascading effects of thermal heterogeneity on trout-salmon interactions in streams where rainbow trout rely heavily on the seasonal availability of anadromous salmon eggs. Water temperature in an Alaskan stream varied spatially from 5 degrees C to 17.5 degrees C, and spawning sockeye salmon showed population differentiation associated with this thermal heterogeneity. Individuals that spawned early in cool regions of the 5 km long stream were genetically differentiated from those spawning in warmer regions later in the season. Sockeye salmon spawning generates a pulsed resource subsidy that supports the majority of seasonal growth in stream-dwelling rainbow trout. The spatial and temporal structuring of sockeye salmon spawn timing in our focal stream extended the duration of the pulsed subsidy compared to a thermally homogeneous stream with a single population of salmon. Further, rainbow trout adopted movement strategies that exploited the multiple pulses of egg subsidies in the thermally heterogeneous stream. Fish that moved to track the resource pulse grew at rates about 2.5 times higher than those that remained stationary or trout in the reference stream with a single seasonal pulse of eggs. Our results demonstrate that habitat heterogeneity can have important effects on the population diversity of dominant species, and in turn, influence their value to species that prey upon them. Therefore, habitat homogenization may have farther-reaching ecological effects than previously considered.},

Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and sub-continental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered.

Our objectives were to quantify the overall rate of trout movement and relate movement behaviors to variation in streamflow, water temperature, and access to coldwater refugia. The study area experienced extremely high seasonal, yearly, and among-stream variability in water temperature and flow. The relative mobility of brook trout within the upper Shavers Fork watershed varied significantly depending on whether individuals resided within the larger main stem or the smaller tributary. The movement rate of trout inhabiting the main stem during summer months (50 m/d) was an order of magnitude higher than that of tributary fish (2 m/d). Movement rates of main-stem-resident brook trout during summer were correlated with the maximum water temperature experienced by the fish and with the fish's initial distance from a known coldwater source. For main-stem trout, use of microhabitats closer to cover was higher during extremely warm periods than during cooler periods; use of microhabitats closer to cover during warm periods was also greater for main-stem trout than for tributary inhabitants. Main-stem-resident trout were never observed in water exceeding 19.5 degrees C. Our study provides some of the first data on brook trout movements in a large Appalachian river system and underscores the importance of managing trout fisheries in a riverscape context. Brook trout conservation in this region will depend on restoration and protection of coldwater refugia in larger river main stems as well as removal of barriers to trout movement near tributary and main-stem confluences.},

We investigated the effectiveness of thermal remote sensing for analyzing spatial patterns of stream temperature and assessed habitat selection by spring chinook salmon, evaluating whether thermal refugia might be responsible for the persistence of these stocks in rivers where water temperatures frequently exceed their upper tolerance levels (25 degrees C) during spawning migration. By presenting stream temperature and the ecology of chinook salmon in a historical context, we could evaluate how changes in riverine habitat and thermal spatial structure, which can be caused by landuse practices, may influence distributional patterns of chinook salmon. Thermal remote sensing provided spatially continuous maps of stream temperature for reaches used by chinook salmon in the upper subbasins of the Middle Fork and North Fork John Day River. Electivity analysis and logistic regression were used to test for associations between the longitudinal distribution of salmon and cool-water areas and stream habitat characteristics. Chinook salmon were distributed nonuniformly in reaches throughout each stream. Salmon distribution and cool water temperature patterns were most strongly related at reach-level spatial scales in the warm stream, the Middle Fork (maximum likelihood ratio: P {\textless} 0.01), and most weakly related in the cold stream, the North Fork (P {\textgreater} 0.30). Pools were preferred by adult chinook salmon in both subbasins (Bonferroni confidence interval: P less than or equal to 0.05); however, riffles were used proportionately more frequently in the North Fork than in the Middle Fork. Our observations of thermal refugia and their use by chinook salmon at multiple spatial scales reveal that, although heterogeneity in the longitudinal stream temperature profile may be viewed as an ecological warning sign, thermal patchiness in streams also should be recognized for its biological potential to provide habitat for species existing at the margin of their environmental tolerances.},

The North Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), a species which until recently formed a major component of the demersal fisheries, has undergone significant declines across its range. The North Sea stock is typical of many, with a spawning stock biomass that has remained below the safe biological limit since 2000 and recruitment levels near the lowest on record. Cod within the North Sea are currently managed as a single stock, and yet mounting empirical evidence supports the existence of a metapopulation of regionally variable, genetically distinct, sub-stocks. Applying the same management strategies to multiple stocks that differ in their resilience to exploitation inevitably results in the overfishing and likely collapse of the weaker components. Indeed, recent studies have identified two North Sea spawning stocks that have undergone disproportionally large collapses with very substantial reductions in egg production. Similarly affected cod stocks in the northwest Atlantic have shown little evidence of recovery, despite fishery closures. The possible implications of ignoring sub-structuring within management units for bio-complexity, local adaptation and ecosystem stability are considered.},

	abstract = {One of the most pervasive themes in ecology is that biological diversity stabilizes ecosystem processes and the services they provide to society(1-4), a concept that has become a common argument for biodiversity conservation(5). Species-rich communities are thought to produce more temporally stable ecosystem services because of the complementary or independent dynamics among species that perform similar ecosystem functions(6). Such variance dampening within communities is referred to as a portfolio effect(7) and is analogous to the effects of asset diversity on the stability of financial portfolios(8). In ecology, these arguments have focused on the effects of species diversity on ecosystem stability but have not considered the importance of biologically relevant diversity within individual species(9). Current rates of population extirpation are probably at least three orders of magnitude higher than species extinction rates(10), so there is a pressing need to clarify how population and life history diversity affect the performance of individual species in providing important ecosystem services. Here we use five decades of data from Oncorhynchus nerka (sockeye salmon) in Bristol Bay, Alaska, to provide the first quantification of portfolio effects that derive from population and life history diversity in an important and heavily exploited species. Variability in annual Bristol Bay salmon returns is 2.2 times lower than it would be if the system consisted of a single homogenous population rather than the several hundred discrete populations it currently consists of. Furthermore, if it were a single homogeneous population, such increased variability would lead to ten times more frequent fisheries closures. Portfolio effects are also evident in watershed food webs, where they stabilize and extend predator access to salmon resources. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of maintaining population diversity for stabilizing ecosystem services and securing the economies and livelihoods that depend on them. The reliability of ecosystem services will erode faster than indicated by species loss alone.},

First, population changes of waders are quantified by estimating population indices from nationwide survey data in Japan between 1975 and 2008. Second, species characteristics shared by declining waders are identified using a phylogenetic comparative method. Finally, based on the revealed characteristics of declining species, composite indices are created for monitoring changes in wader communities in the East Asian-Australasian flyway. The estimated population indices revealed that 12 species out of 41, and 16 out of 42 have declined significantly during spring and autumn migration, respectively, in at least one of the past 10, 20 or 30 year-periods. Phylogenetic comparative analysis revealed that both the use of rice fields and dependence on the Yellow Sea negatively affected the population trends of waders. These results are consistent with the hypothesized negative impact of agricultural intensification caused by land consolidation in Japanese rice fields, and habitat loss and/or degradation in the Yellow Sea caused by the rapid growth of populations and economies in China and South Korea. The framework developed in this study can be applied to a wide range of species, and should play an important role in monitoring population trends and identifying threats to those species in future.

	abstract = {Animal movements in heterogeneous environments play a crucial role in a variety of ecological processes. Although a hierarchical structure to the scale of movements has been observed in many animal species, few studies to date have revealed what causes such multi-spatial scale movements within the framework of optimal theories. Using detailed information on movement paths and prey captures by Intermediate Egrets in rice fields, this study explored the effects of individual experience at multi-temporal scales on subsequent movement parameters. The results supported three predictions based on optimal foraging theories: (1) movement distances at small and large spatial scales are determined by past foraging experiences over short (one minute) and long (seven to eight minutes) temporal scales, respectively; (2) responses to prey encounters vary between temporal scales, e. g., prey attacks in the previous one minute caused egrets to walk away (i.e., area-avoided search), whereas those in the preceding eight minutes caused egrets to stay around (i.e., area-restricted search); and (3) the probability of patch departure by flying increases with decreasing intake rates in the previous seven minutes, and the quitting intake rate is mostly lower than the long-term average, not including travel time. These results suggest that egrets make different adaptive decisions at different spatial scales: in response to a clumped prey distribution at a large spatial scale, and to a dispersed distribution or behavioral depression of prey at a small spatial scale. This study showed that the framework of optimal foraging theories is useful for comprehensively explaining the different movement modes in animals. It should also be emphasized that considering both area-avoided and restricted searches at multi-temporal scales is important for understanding movement decisions, particularly in organisms searching for hierarchically distributed resources.},

	abstract = {Drivers of biodiversity at macroscales have long been of interest in ecology, and climate and topography are now considered to be major drivers. Because humans have transformed most of the Earth's land surface, land use may play a significant role as a driver of biodiversity at a macroscale. Here we disentangle the relationships among climate, topography, land use, available energy (measured by the normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]), and species richness of Japanese forest birds. Species richness was better explained at 40- and 80-km resolutions than at 5-, 10- and 20-km resolutions; it was explained by climate, topography, and land use, and the effects of land use were fully incorporated into those of climate and topography. As temperature increased and elevation decreased, natural forest area decreased, and this decrease intensified in warm lowland areas. With the loss of natural forest, species richness decreased below a certain threshold. As temperature increased and elevation decreased, species richness and NDVI increased slightly or were unchanged in cool highland areas and decreased in warm lowland areas. Species richness increased linearly with the increase in NDVI. Most effects of climate/topography on species richness in warm lowland areas were shared by those of land use, suggesting that the decrease in species richness in warm lowland areas has been caused by loss of natural forest. Therefore, it is suggested that climate and topography determined land use intensity, which in turn, drove species richness through the depletion of available energy. Increasing temperature and decreasing elevation leads to both benefits (increase in potential available energy) and costs (depletion of energy by human land-use change) for forest birds. These costs seem to override benefits in warm lowland areas.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.baae.2012.02.004},
	abstract = {To appropriately predict the patch occupancy of animals, it is often essential to consider not only the habitat structure but also shifts in the habitat requirements of animals with changes in life stage. In addition, asymmetric dispersal among different types of habitat patches is likely to accompany use of multiple habitat types due to differences in the ease with which migrants can find the habitats, to changes in the dispersal ability of animals according to their life stage, or to both factors. However, few studies have explicitly elucidated the contribution of these processes to patch connectivity and to predictions of patterns of patch occupancy. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of multi-type habitat use on patch connectivity of the damselfly Indolestes peregrinus. After emergence, adults of this species move from their native ponds to woodlands for hibernation and return to aquatic habitats for oviposition in the next spring. We recorded the occurrence of I. peregrinus at newly created artificial ponds and attempted to explain patch occupancy using a series of Bayesian statistical models, which incorporate (1) local environment only, (2) both local environment and single-type habitat use connectivity, and (3) both local environment and multi-type habitat use connectivity. In addition, we considered two situations in the third model: symmetric or asymmetric dispersal. Comparing the performance of the candidate models revealed that the best model was the third model assuming asymmetric dispersal and it explained 18.8\% of the deviance. The result suggests that multi-type habitat use is important for determining patch connectivity of I. peregrinus, and that there is asymmetry in the connectivity from pond to woodland patches and vice versa for the damselfly. Both multi-type habitat use and asymmetric dispersal processes are likely to apply to many other taxa and landscapes.},

To test this hypothesis, we conducted periodic censuses of adult dragonflies at small man-made ponds. We compared the two above functional groups in terms of the degree to which species occurrence depended on landscape structure. The difference among the two groups was not significant, but occurrence of long-phase species tended to depend on landscape structure.

During 2 yr of weekly sampling, we found that M. leidyi populations in a shallow embayment, Greenwich Cove, either overwintered or were only briefly absent during winter. The Greenwich Cove population reproduced weeks earlier and reached higher average and peak population concentrations than open-bay populations. Shallow embayment populations such as that in Greenwich Cove probably serve as source populations that inoculate the main region of the bay by advective transport in the spring months. We propose that earlier occurrences of M. leidyi during recent years are due to amplification of pulsed spring warming events that permit early reproduction in the shallow embayments that serve as source regions for M. leidyi in Narragansett Bay. We further suggest that the source-sink perspective we describe is relevant not only to Narragansett Bay but other temperate regions of the world persistently occupied by M. leidyi.},

We discover that the risk of population extinction is larger for spatially aggregated disturbances than for spatially random disturbances. By changing the spatial configuration of the patches in the system-leading to different proportions of edge and interior patches-we demonstrate that the probability of metapopulation extinction is smaller when the metapopulation is more compact. Both of these results become more pronounced when colonization connectivity decreases. Our results have important management implication as edge patches, which are invariably considered to be less important, may play an important role as disturbance refugia. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The conservation of endangered affiliate species, which are critically dependent on the presence of another species, is often hindered by a poor understanding of the relationships between the interacting partners. The parasitic stage of endangered unionid bivalves constitutes a tight hostaffiliate linkage between the mussels and their host fishes. However, the threats resulting from potential shortages of the host species are rarely sufficiently quantified and incorporated into conservation strategies. In this paper, we integrated both host quality and availability analyses to assess the potential threats to the endangered thick-shelled river mussel Unio crassus that result from the impairment of its host resources in Central Europe. The experimental determination of the compatibility of U.?crassus parasitic larvae (glochidia) with its potential host fishes revealed an intermediate level of host specificity. At least, some glochidia successfully developed on 14 of the 27 potential hosts that were evaluated. Nevertheless, only three fish species (Scardinius erythrophthalmus, Phoxinus phoxinus and Cottus gobio) enabled the majority of the attached glochidia to transform successfully. Subsequently, our analysis of host availability at sites inhabited by living or extirpated populations of U.?crassus showed that the local extirpations of U.?crassus are likely associated with an impaired status of the fish assemblage and with the absence of the primary host fishes. These results indicate that the availability of host fish resources may have played at least an additive role in the present pan-European decline of U.?crassus and that the evaluation of host limitation without precise data on the host compatibility or host abundance may be ineffective for identifying the threats to particular species. It demonstrates a strong need for more thorough incorporation of host limitation issues into conservation strategies for U.?crassus and probably also for other species of freshwater mussels that were previously considered safe from host limitation.},

	abstract = {1. Within the distribution area of the freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera L.), the maximum observed life span attained in a population varies from 30 to 132 years and the maximum shell length from 80 to 145 mm. For both life-history traits, the growth constant k is a major determinant. The growth constant describes the shape of the average individual growth curve, the lower its value, the slower is the asymptote approached. Maximum size and life span increase as the growth constant declines and the maximum age almost equals the time necessary to complete the growth pattern. 2. With increasing latitude, from North Spain up to the polar circle, the growth constant declines, whereas age and size increase. This must be attributed to the close relationship between the growth constant and metabolism. As temperature decreases (towards the north), metabolic rate declines and the rate of growth decreases; the asymptote is approached slowly and this leads to a long life. Simultaneously, there is probably a shift in the anabolic-catabolic-balance increasing the asymptotic size and hence the maximum size. 3. The growth constant and maximum life span also respond to the productivity of the habitat. There is a negative correlation between growth constant and eutrophication, and the maximum life span is reduced as the concentration of nitrate increases. 4. Implications for Bergmann's rule and for the theory of ageing are discussed. It is concluded that this variability is a case of phenotypic plasticity with no adaptive value because: (i) plasticity must be attributed to unavoidable physiological responses; (ii) between populations the relationships between maximum life span, maximum size and reproductive output are positive, whereas trade-offs would be expected if variation in life-history tactics was the source of plasticity; and (iii) the demographic consequences of plasticity may be highly disadvantageous.},

Therefore, we hypothesized that low temperature might facilitate successful encystment and transformation of the parasitic glochidia larvae of unionid mussels on fish hosts. Glochidia of the flat floater, Anodonta suborbiculata, are present on hosts from January through March, when water temperature is low. The \% transformation success of attached glochidia in laboratory infections on fish hosts (golden shiner, Notemigonus crysoleucas) was significantly higher at 10 degrees C (67\%) and 15 degrees C (62\%) than at 21 degrees C (42\%). In contrast, transformation success of glochidia in vitro was significantly lower at 10 degrees C (39\%) than at 15 degrees C (89\%) or 20 degrees C (93\%). Thus, the improved survival at low temperature on fish hosts does not appear to involve direct effects of temperature on the glochidia. These results support the hypothesis that immune suppression of fish hosts by low temperature enhances transformation success of this winter-breeding species. We also tested the effects of CO2 pH, and HEPES buffer on transformation of Bat floater glochidia in vitro at 15 degrees C. Transformation success was highest at the lowest pH tested (7.6) and the highest level of CO2 tested (5\% CO2). This result is consistent with previous studies of other species, but is puzzling because the physiological pH of fish body fluids is higher and the level of CO2 is much lower. Although most workers have incubated glochidia in 5\% CO2 we found that transformation success was fairly high (68\%) without elevated CO2 provided that pH was kept low HEPES buffer reduced transformation success.},

	abstract = {Freshwater mussels (order Unioniformes) fulfill an essential role in benthic aquatic communities, but also are among the most sensitive and rapidly declining faunal groups in North America. Rising water temperatures, caused by global climate change, industrial discharges, drought, or land development, could further challenge imperiled unionid communities. The aim of our study was to determine the upper thermal tolerances of the larval (glochidia) and juvenile life stages of freshwater mussels. Glochidia of 8 species of mussels were tested: Lampsilis siliquoidea, Potamilus alatus, Ligumia recta, Ellipsaria lineolata, Lasmigona complanata, Megalonaias nervosa, Alasmidonta varicosa, and Villosa delumbis. Seven of these species also were tested as juveniles. Survival trends were monitored while mussels held at 3 acclimation temperatures (17, 22, and 27 degrees C) were exposed to a range of common and extreme water temperatures (20-42 degrees C) in standard acute laboratory tests. The average median lethal temperature (LT50) among species in 24-h tests with glochidia was 31.6 degrees C and ranged from 21.4 to 42.7 degrees C. The mean LT50 in 96-h juvenile tests was 34.7 degrees C and ranged from 32.5 to 38.8 degrees C. Based on comparisons of LT50s, thermal tolerances differed among species for glochidia, but not for juveniles. Acclimation temperature did not affect thermal tolerance for either life stage. Our results indicate that freshwater mussels already might be living close to their upper thermal tolerances in some systems and, thus, might be at risk from rising environmental temperatures.},

Here we show how the persistence of a native prey (water vole, Arvicola terrestris) is determined by the spatial distribution of an invasive prey (European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus) and directly infer how this is defined by the mobility of a shared invasive predator (American mink, Neovison vison). This study uniquely demonstrates that variation in habitat connectivity in large-scale natural landscapes creates spatial asynchrony, enabling coexistence between apparent competitive native and invasive species. These findings highlight that unexpected interactions may be involved in species declines, and also that in such cases habitat heterogeneity should be considered in wildlife management decisions.},

Responses varied by species, but mussels acclimated to 25 degrees C generally had a higher CTM than mussels acclimated to 15 degrees C. For E. complanata, the effects of acclimation temperature and aeration were interactive, such that CTM was highest at 15 degrees C but only under aerated conditions. Our results indicate that recent thermal history affects thermal tolerance, combinations of environmental stressors may influence thermal tolerance, and such responses vary among species.},

We describe population heterogeneity in a state-structured framework, employing advection-diffusion as the fundamental movement process of individuals occupying different movement states. Our general analysis shows that population heterogeneity in movement behavior can be defined as the existence of different movement states and among-individual variability in the time individuals spend in these states. A presentation of moment-based metrics of movement illustrates the role of these attributes in general dispersal processes. We also present a special case of the general theory: a model population composed of individuals occupying one of two movement states with linear transitions, or exchange, between the two states. This two-state "exchange model" can be viewed as a correlated random walk and provides a generalization of the telegraph equation. By exploiting the main result of our general analysis, we characterize the exchange model by deriving moment-based metrics of its movement process and identifying an analytical representation of the model's time-dependent solution. Our results provide general and specific theoretical explanations for empirical patterns in organism movement; the results also provide conceptual and analytical bases for extending diffusion-based dispersal theory in several directions, thereby facilitating mechanistic links between individual behavior and spatial population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Using a mark-recapture technique in a small temperate stream, we described the movement of four fish species over a five-month period and developed a mathematical model that described the observed movement patterns. The movement distributions were generally leptokurtic, and two of the four species demonstrated some degree of upstream bias. There was little difference in movement among species or through time. There were no temporal correlations in probability of movement, movement direction, or distance moved. The spatial spread of the most abundant species, bluehead chubs, over a four-month period was characterized by upstream bias, diffusion-like spread, and persistent leptokurtosis. Bluehead chubs demonstrated complex relationships between probability of movement and size and growth, while creek chubs showed only an effect of size on probability of movement. Further, growth of individual bluehead chubs was correlated through time. These empirical results suggest the hypothesis that heterogeneity in phenotypic attributes, such as size and growth, is related to heterogeneity in movement behavior. A diffusion-advection model of bluehead chub movement, structured with two subgroups that dispersed at different rates ("fast fish" and "slow fish"), was parameterized and validated with the field data. This model with heterogeneity in movement rates generated the leptokurtic pattern observed in the field data, in contrast to the classic diffusion model without population heterogeneity, which produces a normal distribution. The results from this work suggest that heterogeneity in fitness-influencing attributes such as size and growth could explain heterogeneity in individual-level movement behavior and might underlie the leptokurtic patterns that have been observed at the population level in numerous field studies.},

Contrary to predictions, from 28 to 60\% of marked fish moved at least one habitat unit, and immigration of unmarked fish also indicated considerable movement. Upstream movement predominated but the stream with the step-pool/cascade channel type had fewer upstream movers and greater distances moved downstream. Coho movers were not smaller than nonmovers, as predicted based on assumptions that movement results from competitive exclusion. Habitat units that coho left were smaller and shallower but lower in density than units where coho remained. Thus, movement is a common phenomenon rather than an aberration, and may reflect habitat choice rather than territorial eviction. Moreover, movers grew faster than nonmovers, so the "mobile fraction" of the population was not composed of competitively inferior fish but rather individuals that thrived. The phenomenon of small-scale habitat- and growth-related movements should be considered when planning and interpreting studies of juvenile salmonid ecology in streams.},

The probability of movement was related to the period of observation, initial location, and possibly individual growth rate, whereas distance moved was related to fish size and initial location. Furthermore, it appeared that movements by juveniles were mostly downstream, whereas those of older fish were largely upstream. Movement of cutthroat trout in this basin appeared to be driven by ontogenetic changes in habitat use and variation in habitat productivity. Given that this stream network exemplifies the complexity typical of many mountain watersheds, movement as a life history tactic in fishes may be more common than is sometimes recognized.},

To predict genetic consequences of the selection we developed a deterministic genetic model based on a classical ''super-gene'' model and we studied the effects of pollinator availability and inbreeding depression on temporal changes of morph frequencies through model simulation. Because of the severe pollinator limitation experienced by the population fast, irreversible loss of the thrum morph from the population was predicted even if high inbreeding depression was assumed To prevent the breakdown of the normal breeding system of the species, morph frequency monitoring for timely active management should be implemented Active management should include hand pollinations and pollinator therapy-reintroduction and reestablishment of suitable pollinator populations The method we adopted in this study to parametrize pollinator availability can be used widely in conservation modeling for a range of plant species that have multiple mating types with different degrees of self-incompatibility.},

Whether prey increase or decrease their movement rates in response to predators will greatly influence the impact that predators have on prey density. In stream systems the type of predator, benthic versus water-column, is expected to influence whether prey increase or decrease their movement rates. Experiments were conducted to examine the response of amphipods (Gammarus minus) to benthic and water-column predators and to examine the interplay between amphipod response to predators and predator consumption of prey in determining prey density. Amphipods did not respond to nor were they consumed by the benthic predator. Thus, this predator had no impact on amphipod density. In contrast, amphipods did respond to two species of water-column predators (the predatory fish bluegills, Lepomis us, and striped shiners, Luxilus chrysocephalus) by decreasing their activity rates. This response led to similar positive effects on amphipod density at night by both species of predatory fish. However, striped shiners did not consume many amphipods, suggesting their impact on the whole amphipod "population" was zero. In contrast, bluegills consumed a significant number of amphipods, and thus had a negative impact on the amphipod "population". These results lend support to theoretical work which suggests that prey behavioral responses to predators can mask the true impact that predators have on prey populations when experiments are conducted at small scales.},

Irrespective of the genet type, pollen germination began within 24 h after pollination and tubes of pollen reached to the style base with 48-96 h after inter-morph pollination. Although pollen tubes germinated after self-pollination in the SC genets, the number of germinated pollen tubes was significantly lower than in the case of inter-morph pollination. Few pollen tubes germinated after self-pollination of the SI or short-styled genets. In SC genets, the rate of pollen-tube growth did not differ between self-morph and inter-morph pollination (similar to 1.9 mm/day). Therefore, differences in self-compatibility between SC and SI genets in P. sieboldii are likely to be attributable to differential pollen germination rates rather than to differential pollen-tube growth rates.},

We tested hypotheses that upstream movements by brook trout are limited or absent in reaches of steep streams and are more prevalent and longer in gradually sloping streams. We compared brook trout movements in headwater streams in Idaho at sites with varied channel slopes (averages of {\textless}1-12\%). After eradicating fish from 200-m stream sections, we assessed immigration of marked fish into these sections. Contrary to our hypothesis, upstream movements were more prevalent than downstream movements during the summer, even in steep streams. Marked brook trout ascended stream channels with slopes of 13\% that extended for more than 67 m and 22\% for more than 14 m; they also ascended a 1.2-m-high falls. Nearly vertical falls, rather than steep slopes per se, apparently inhibited upstream movements. Our hypothesis that upstream movements would decrease with increasing channel slope was partially supported; fish did nor move as far upstream in steep as in gradual sites, and upstream movements through steep channels were dominated by larger fish ({\textgreater}135 mm total length). Immigration by marked fish smaller than 95 mm was uncommon in all sites. Slopes up to 13\% do not ensure against upstream dispersal, although other mechanisms may inhibit brook trout invasion in steep channels. In very steep channels, fewer dispersing fish and slower upstream movement rates may increase the time required for successful invasion and reduce its likelihood of occurrence.},

	abstract = {I propose proximal mechanisms that help explain, unify, and expand the predictions of widely accepted empirical models of settlement in streams. I separated the process that leads to settlement of a drifting particle into three stages: (1) initial contact with a substrate, (2) attachment, and (3) settlement sensu stricto. I used physical principles (height above the bed, sinking rate, current speed profile) to predict time until contact (stage 1). I compared these predictions with empirical measurements of settlement of individual black fly larvae (Simulium vittatum) in a laboratory flume. I developed models from empirical data for stages 2 and 3. Each of these models is individual-based and predicts the fate of a single individual. To obtain a population level prediction, models for the three stages were combined and used to simulate the settlement of a group of black fly larvae. The predictions of this simulation were qualitatively similar to population level data from the literature particularly after the incorporation of channel-wide spatial heterogeneity in current speed. The effect of flow heterogeneity on the model agrees with previous work on the lateral transport of stream invertebrates during drift events showing that many organisms settle preferentially in slower areas. By using proximal principles, the approach used in this study brings into focus basic parameters and processes that influence settlement at the scale of the organisms. It also provides a null hypothesis against which to study the effect of local flow heterogeneity on the settlement of stream invertebrates and the capacity of organisms to actively influence settlement. Water currents in streams and rivers commonly transport large numbers of organisms. Consequently, hydrodynamic factors that favor or hamper the settlement of these organisms can potentially influence distributions and abundance. Moreover, if settlement probabilities vary with flow characteristics, this can in turn influence foraging strategies that rely on fluid-mediated dispersal.},

	abstract = {We estimated deposition and resuspension rates of natural particulate organic matter (POM) in Bloomington Creek, Idaho, a mountain stream flowing at 225 L s(-1). POM was collected from the water column, fractionated into two size classes-very fine POM (VFPOM, 15-52 mu m) and fine POM (FPOM, 53-106 mu m), and radiolabeled by using C-14-dimethylsulfate. The labeled particles in each size class and a conservative tracer were released to the stream in metered pulses and then sampled from the water column at six stations extending 1 km downstream for 4 d. Deposition and resuspension rates were estimated by fitting a one-dimensional advection-dispersion model to C-14-concentrations measured during and after release. Model-estimated deposition velocities were 0.12 (0.09-0.16, 95\% confidence interval) and 0.18 (0.10-0.31) mm, s(-1) for VFPOM and FPOM, respectively. There was some (similar to 0.05 mm s-1) additional short-term (similar to 20 min) detention of VFPOM and FPOM that may have been related to transient storage. For VFPOM, 34\% of deposited particles resuspended after a mean residence time of 13 (6.9-25) h, and the remainder resuspended with a residence time of 7.5 (2.9-19) d. For FPOM, these estimates were 17\%, 2.4 (1.0-4.9) h, and 2.6 (1.7-4.0) d, respectively. The weighted mean residence times and downstream velocities of particle migration were 5.1 d and 150 In d(-1) for VFPOM, and 2.2 d and 230 m d(-1) for FPOM.

The objectives were (i) to determine experimentally and to model the relationship between mean water velocity and both the mean distance travelled, and the mean time spent, in the drift by freshwater shrimps, Gammarus pulex; (ii) to develop a drift distance-water velocity model from the experimental study, and validate it with field data; (iii) to examine the relationship between drift rate, water velocity and benthic density with the latter expressed as a mean value for the whole stream and a mean value corrected for the distance travelled in the drift. 2. In field experiments at 10 water velocities (0.032-0.962 m s(-1)), the significant relationship between the mean drift distance and mean water velocity was described both by a power function (power, 0.96) and a linear relationship. The mean drift time was fairly constant at 8.3 s (95\% CL +/- 0.4). A simple model estimated the drift distance and time spent in the drift by different percentages of the drifting invertebrates. This model predicted correctly the positive relationship between drift rate and water velocity for field data over a year. 3. The relationship between drift rate per hour and the independent variables, water velocity and benthic density, was well described by a multiple-regression model. Adding temperature and date did not improve model fit. Variations in water velocity and benthic density explained 96\% of the variation in nocturnal drift rate (65\% to velocity, 31\% to benthic density), but only 40\% of the variation in diurnal drift rate (29\% to velocity, 11\% to benthic density). Correcting benthic density for the drift distances did not improve model fit. 4. The significance of this study is that it developed models to predict drift distances and time, values being similar to those obtained in another, larger stream. It also illustrated the importance of spatial scale in the interpretation of drift by showing that when drift distances were taken into account, the impact of drift on the population was higher (4-10\% lost day(-1)) than when drift distances were ignored (usually {\textless} 3\% lost day(-1)), especially at a local level.},

	abstract = {Most ecological studies of particle transport in streams that focus on fine particulate organic matter or benthic invertebrates use the Exponential Settling Model (ESM) to characterize the longitudinal pattern of particle settling on the bed. The ESM predicts that if particles are released into a stream, the proportion that have not yet settled will decline exponentially with transport time or distance and will be independent of the release elevation above the bed. To date, no credible basis in fluid mechanics has been established for this model, nor has it been rigorously tested against more-mechanistic alternative models. One alternative is the Local Exchange Model (LEM), which is a stochastic advection-diffusion model that includes both longitudinal and vertical spatial dimensions and is based on classical fluid mechanics. The LEM predicts that particle settling will be non-exponential in the near field but will become exponential in the far field, providing a new theoretical justification for far-field exponential settling that is based on plausible fluid mechanics. We review properties of the ESM and LEM and compare these with available empirical evidence. Most evidence supports the prediction of both models that settling will be exponential in the far field but contradicts the ESM's prediction that a single exponential distribution will hold for all transport times and distances.

The T-crit values (29(.)4 +/- 0(.)1degrees C) for small (40-140 g) redband trout from the three streams, and large (400-1400 g) redband trout at Bridge Creek were not different, and were comparable to published values for other salmonids. At high water temperatures (24-28degrees C), large fish incurred higher metabolic costs and were more thermally sensitive than small fish. U-crit (3(.)6 +/- 0(.)1 L-F s(-1)), R-r (200 +/- 13 mg O-2 kg(-0.830) h(-1)) and metabolic power (533 +/- 22 mg O-2 kg(-0.882) h(-1)) were not significantly different between populations of small redband trout at 24 degreesC. R-max and metabolic power, however, were higher than previous measurements for rainbow trout at these temperatures. Fish from Bridge Creek had a 30\% lower minimum total cost of transport (C-min), exhibited a lower refusal rate, and had smaller hearts than fish at 12-mile or Rock Creeks. In contrast, no differences in U-crit or metabolism were observed between the two size classes of redband trout, although C-min was significantly lower for large fish at all swimming speeds. Biochemical analyses revealed that fish from 12-mile Creek, which had the highest refusal rate (36\%), were moderately hyperkalemic and had substantially lower circulating levels of free fatty acids, triglycerides and albumin. Aerobic and anaerobic enzyme activities in axial white muscle, however, were not different between populations, and morphological features were similar. Results of this study: 1) suggest that the physiological mechanisms that determine T-crit in salmonids are highly conserved; 2) show that adult (large) redband trout are more susceptible to the negative affects of elevated temperatures than small redband trout; 3) demonstrate that swimming efficiency can vary considerably between redband trout populations; 4) suggest that metabolic energy stores correlate positively with swimming behaviour of redband trout at high water temperatures; 5) question the use of T-crit for assessing physiological function and defining thermal habitat requirements of stream-dwelling salmonids like the redband trout.

	abstract = {1, Foraging behaviour, diet and interference competition were examined for two morphologically similar charrs, Salvelinus malma (Dolly Varden) and S. leucomaenis (white-spotted charr), under varying food resource conditions over four summers in a Japanese mountain stream. Data were used to test predictions from a mechanistic model of resource partitioning developed from an earlier field experiment. 2, The charrs adopted one of two distinct foraging modes, ambushing drifting invertebrates from relatively fixed foraging positions or actively searching for benthic prey over large areas, The proportion of benthos foragers increased markedly when drifting prey declined, and was much greater in S. malma than S, leucomaenis when drift was lean, upholding predictions made from our earlier experiment. 3. For drift foragers of both species, frequency of foraging attempts decreased as drift rate declined, and aggressive encounters increased. In contrast, for benthos foragers of both species the frequency of foraging attempts was essentially constant across the range of benthos biomass measured, and aggressive encounters remained low. 4. Salvelinus leucomaenis ate larger drifting prey than S, malma, even though the former charr were smaller. In contrast, S, malma foraged on benthic prey at a higher rate than S, leucomaenis, although there was no difference in prey mass. Thus, the optimal point to shift to benthic foraging is at a higher drift threshold for S. malma than S, leucomaenis, most probably due to differences in jaw morphology. Moreover, because dominance for favourable drift foraging positions was based on size alone, S, malma shifted to benthos foraging at a larger size than S. leucomaenis, as predicted by a simple model. 5, Charr consumed distinct prey types according to their foraging mode. Drift foragers primarily ate terrestrial invertebrates, whereas benthos foragers ate mainly chironomid larvae. Consequently, diet overlap was high when drift was abundant and both species were drift foragers, but declined as drift declined and S. malma shifted to benthos foraging. Therefore, species-specific differences in foraging mode shifts across the resource gradient explained the flexible resource partitioning we observed, and probably account for the coexistence of these congeneric charrs in zones of sympatry in northern Japan.},

We studied territory size, mobility, and foraging behavior of young-of-the-year Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in relation to several key environmental factors in Catamaran Brook, New Brunswick, Canada. The 50 study fish were all multiple central-place foragers (i.e., alternated among several sit-and-wait foraging stations) and showed great variability in territory size and the total distance traveled within the territories. Territory size increased with the mean distance traveled between consecutive foraging stations, the number of stations visited, and the mean foraging radius. Fish also varied greatly in how much of the total travel distance was associated with foraging at a station (14.8-91.8\%) versus switching among stations (4.6-84.3\%). As predicted, fish in slow-flowing waters, where drifting prey were scarce, used larger multiple central-place territories than individuals in faster, more productive waters. Interestingly, however, the most mobile fish did not inhabit slow-running waters as predicted but were found at intermediate (optimal) water current velocities. Hence, our study suggests that among some multiple central-place foragers, increased mobility may not only serve to increase prey encounter rate but may reflect an attempt to patrol territories in favorable habitats. Further studies are needed to determine the generality and the ultimate benefits of multiple central-place space use among stream-dwelling fish and other animals.},

2.  Size-structured linear dominance hierarchies were recognized among individuals inhabiting the same stream pools.  Observations on space utilization and foraging behaviour revealed fish to be either territorial or nonterritorial.  Within each local pool, dominant fish exclusively occupied the mid or surface layer of the pools as foraging territories, whereas subordinates adopted nonterritorial tactics, primarily utilizing the bottom layer.
3.  Of the territorial fish, more dominant individuals tended to occupy focal points nearer the pool inlet, where they had priority of access to drifting food items.  These fish showed higher actual foraging rates, feeding upon larger prey than their subordinates.  This foraging advantage resulted in their having larger daily growth increments.
4.  The more dominant fish in each pool exhibited a more sedentary tendency than their subordinates.  Population densities in the pools did not fluctuate appreciably owing to both emigration of nonterritorial subordinates and immigration.
5.  These results support the hypothesis that unequal resource partitioning among individuals subject to a dominance hierarchy plays an important role in their density-dependent population regulation.},

	abstract = {1. Understanding mechanisms behind the distribution of organisms along a gradient of hydrological connectivity is crucial for sustainable management of riverfloodplain systems. We tested the hypothesis that frequency of flood pulses exerts a direct influence on the distribution of freshwater mussels (Unionoida) by creating a local environment that limits their fitness. 2. Multiscale habitat analyses combined with transplant-rearing experiments were carried out with a focus on abundance, presence/absence, survival rates and growth rates of mussels. Sixty-nine floodplain waterbodies (FWBs) were surveyed within a 15-km lowland segment of the Kiso River in Japan. 3. The abundance of mussels significantly increased with increased frequency of inundation associated with flood pulses at the among-FWB scale, while the probability of occurrence of mussels was negatively predicted by the amount of benthic organic matter at the within-FWB scale. 4. Field-rearing experiments showed that survival rates were low and growth rates nearly zero in infrequently inundated FWBs (these FWBs had no naturally occurring resident mussels). In such FWBs, hypoxia (DO {\textless} 2 mg L-1) was frequently observed near the bottom when temperature was optimal for mussel growth ({\textgreater}15 degrees C). 5. These findings demonstrated that flood pulse frequency was the most important factor in determining mussel distribution in FWBs because it directly limits mussels fitness by mediating local environmental factors, possibly dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. Successful restoration efforts for mussel habitat conservation should focus on processes that lead to improved local conditions.},

Three replicate groups of 16 fish were held under a 12:12 light:dark cycle at 16 degrees C for 56 days. After a 28-day self-feeder acclimation period all three groups had become competent self-feeders and the treatment period ran from day 28 to day 56. Under the experimental light and temperature regime utilised amago appear to be visual self-feeders, actuating self-feeders almost exclusively during the light phase (99.9\% of actuations). All three groups exhibited a distinct diurnal feeding rhythm within the light phase and demonstrated significant (P {\textless} 0.05) crepuscular peaks in feed demand. In addition, one group also displayed a significant peak at midday. Daily ration varied both within and between groups but no clear rhythmicity was observed in these variations.

The behavior of 3 species of unionid mussels (Unio tumidus, Unio pictorum, and Anodonta anatina) was examined in the lowland River Spree (Germany). Mussels were marked individually, and their positions on the sediment surface and depth below the sediment surface were recorded weekly between May and October 2004. The average rate of horizontal movement was 11 +/- 15 cm/wk (mean +/- SD). The direction of the movements seemed erratic; however, a significant net shoreward displacement of similar to 17 cm, possibly caused by rising water levels, was observed during the study A surprisingly high percentage of the mussels (74 +/- 7\%) was burrowed entirely in the sediment to depths as great as 20 cm during the summer. Smaller mussels and individuals not infested by the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, burrowed deeper in the sediments than larger or infested mussels. Burrowing reduced infestation densities in a laboratory experiment. Significantly more U. tumidus individuals were found on the sediment surface during the reproductive period in early summer than in late summer, suggesting that reproductive activity may influence burrowing. Burrowing was significantly related to current velocity (discharge), day length, and water temperature (multiple linear regression, R-2 = 0.74, P {\textless} 0.001), but current velocity appeared to be the dominant factor driving vertical movements (R-2 = 0.53, p {\textless} 0.01). We propose that movement behaviors are important adaptations of unionid mussel populations to the flow and food conditions in rivers. Movement behavior also may help unionids escape predators and control infestation by D. polymorpha.},

Although several scenarios can result in a lack of concordance between historical patterns and contemporary experiments, we argue that the coupling of phylogenetic and experimental methods is an increasingly revealing approach to hypothesis testing in evolutionary ecology.},

	abstract = {Small-bodied fishes constitute an important assemblage in many wetlands. In wetlands that dry periodically except for small permanent waterbodies, these fishes are quick to respond to change and can undergo large fluctuations in numbers and biomasses. An important aspect of landscapes that are mixtures of marsh and permanent waterbodies is that high rates of biomass production occur in the marshes during flooding phases, while the permanent waterbodies serve as refuges for many biotic components during the dry phases. The temporal and spatial dynamics of the small fishes are ecologically important, as these fishes provide a crucial food base for higher trophic levels, such as wading birds. We develop a simple model that is analytically tractable, describing the main processes of the spatio-temporal dynamics of a population of small-bodied fish in a seasonal wetland environment, consisting of marsh and permanent waterbodies. The population expands into newly flooded areas during the wet season and contracts during declining water levels in the dry season. If the marsh dries completely during these times (a drydown), the fish need refuge in permanent waterbodies. At least three new and general conclusions arise from the model: (1) there is an optimal rate at which fish should expand into a newly flooding area to maximize population production; (2) there is also a fluctuation amplitude of water level that maximizes fish production, and (3) there is an upper limit on the number of fish that can reach a permanent waterbody during a drydown, no matter how large the marsh surface area is that drains into the waterbody. Because water levels can be manipulated in many wetlands, it is useful to have an understanding of the role of these fluctuations.},

In northeastern North America, distributions of floater mussels (Pyganodon spp.) are allopatric and arranged in an east-west pattern that corresponds poorly with the biogeographic patterns of the regional fish fauna. This study aims at determining whether associations with distinct fish species can explain the distribution of floaters. Here, we devised a framework based on a series of novel distributional null models to elucidate dispersal of species that are dependent on host species. The distributional patterns of floaters were tested by controlling for associations with fishes, while host-parasite associations were assessed with null models based on co-occurrence patterns. The disjoint distribution of the giant floater (Pyganodon grandis) and the eastern floater (Pyganodon cataracta) could not be explained by their association with distinct host fish and is likely the result of associations with distinct host populations rather than distinct species. In contrast, the distribution of the Newfoundland floater (Pyganodon fragilis) could be explained by its association with euryhaline fishes. Such associations may have also promoted differentiation with its sister taxa, the eastern floater. This study demonstrated the effects of positive biological associations on distributional patterns and the utility of a null model framework to uncover them.},

The HSI (habitat suitability index) and WUA (weighted useable area) of aquatic organisms were quantitatively calculated using a distributed runoff model coupled with a heat budget model, land cover data, and digital cartographic data. The results showed that the HSI values of O. masou masou and P. altivelis altivel tended to be high in locations where they were actually observed. The HSI distribution patterns of L. cruciata and L. lateralis showed different results, even though the two species are in the same genus and have similar life cycles. The HSI distribution of Anura sp. returned an average value for the whole basin except for urban and upstream basin areas. In fact, Anura sp. frogs were observed throughout the study basin. Incorporating the dynamic factor of water temperature in the model allowed for monthly evaluations, especially for annual migratory organisms, such as P. altivelis altivel. WUA fluctuations, considering river water temperature, can characterize the annual behavior of P. altivelis altivel and Anura sp., and the partial behavior of O. masou masou. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The dispersal capacity of P. corneus, as a key factor to survival, was analysed using different computer model approaches: a general equation-based model and an individual-based model. Both models came to different conclusions on the maximum covered distances of P. corneus-individuals. The parametrisation of the models were based on detailed laboratory measurements and field experiments performed with specimen of the fen wetland system of Rhin-Havelluch (Brandenburg, North-East Germany). Based on the results of the statistical analysis, the dispersal behaviour could be depicted in the equation-based model as a random walk which implied a relatively regular resource utilisation in long-term simulations. Depicting the dispersal qualities of P. corneus with a highly resolved individual-based model showed distinct local aggregations clusters of the snail-individuals. As a consequence, the resource utilisation was less regularly in the long-term simulations for the individual-based model than it was in the equation-based model. Another characteristic of the individual-based representation was that in the case of several consecutive move steps and based on the autocorrelation of the data the P. corneus-individuals could use a wider area of space. The data from the empirical measurements of short-term dispersal observations of single individuals were integrated within the different model extrapolations. This made it possible to discuss the long-term consequences, like the large dispersal range of the individuals and the spatial distribution of the Population in the plane, for the persistence of P. corneus in a real landscape.

	abstract = {1. The importance of native freshwater mussels for ecosystem processes depends on their density, size distribution and activity. In lakes, many of the factors that affect mussels (fish hosts, habitat, food) could be directly or indirectly related to wind-driven physical processes. 2. We tested whether the abundance and size of Elliptio complanata in the shallow, nearshore areas of a medium-sized lake were related to site exposure, substratum type and fish distribution. To disentangle some of the correlated variables known to affect mussel distribution, we used paired exposed and sheltered sampling sites along the 7-km fetch of the lake basin. 3. The distribution of sediment characteristics in nearshore areas was highly predictable. The mean depth of accumulated soft sediments decreased with increasing fetch at wind-exposed sites, but increased with increasing fetch at sheltered sites. Sediments were deeper along the main shoreline than around islands. Deeper sediments tended to be finer and higher in silt content and organic fraction. 4. The density and proportion of juvenile mussels along the main shoreline varied in a unimodal way with sediment depth. These results suggest that wind-driven physical forces affect the transport of young juveniles to sediment depositional areas and create sediment conditions that influence their growth and survival. In contrast, the proportion of juvenile mussels around islands was not related to sediment characteristics, but decreased with remoteness of the island, suggesting that the distribution of juvenile mussels may be limited by fish movements. These results are tentative since they do not include buried juvenile mussels. 5. We also found a unimodal relationship between total mussel density (juveniles and adults) and sediment depth but, in contrast to the relationship for juveniles only, it applied to all sites with soft sediments, including islands. We conclude that factors related to sediment depth affect the growth and survival of adult mussels around islands and that these factors are strong enough to modify the pattern of distribution established via dispersal during earlier life stages. 6. The mean shell length of adults at different sites within the lake basin ranged from 60 to 85 mm. Mussel shell length decreased with increasing fetch at sites exposed to the prevalent winds, but was relatively constant on the sheltered side of peninsulas and islands. The size of unionid mussels in different parts of the lake seems to be determined both by their exposure to physical forces and by sediments. 7. The local distribution of E. complanata is determined, directly and indirectly, by wind-driven forces. These processes are likely to be important for other benthic organisms affected by similar habitat conditions (e.g. sediment characteristics, physical disturbance).},

This study presents a modeling framework based on dispersal kernels (modified Laplace distributions) that describe stream fish dispersal in the presence of obstacles to passage. We used mark-recapture trials to quantify summer dispersal of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in four streams crossed by a highway. The analysis identified population heterogeneity in dispersal behavior, as revealed by the presence of a dominant sedentary component (48-72\% of all individuals) characterized by short mean dispersal distance ({\textless}10 m), and a secondary mobile component characterized by longer mean dispersal distance (56-1086 m). We did not detect evidence of barrier effects on dispersal through highway crossings. Simulation of various plausible scenarios indicated that detectability of barrier effects was strongly dependent on features of sampling design, such as spatial configuration of the sampling area, barrier extent, and sample size. The proposed modeling framework extends conventional dispersal kernels by incorporating structural barriers. A major strength of the approach is that ecological process (dispersal model) and sampling design (observation model) are incorporated simultaneously into the analysis. This feature can facilitate the use of prior knowledge to improve sampling efficiency of mark-recapture trials in movement studies. Model-based estimation of barrier permeability and its associated uncertainty provides a rigorous approach for quantifying the effect of barriers on stream fish dispersal and assessing population dynamics of stream fish in fragmented landscapes.},

	abstract = {Human activities are causing Earth's sixth major extinction event(1)-an accelerating decline of the world's stocks of biological diversity at rates 100 to 1,000 times pre-human levels(2). Historically, low-impact intrusion into species habitats arose from local demands for food, fuel and living space(3). However, in today's increasingly globalized economy, international trade chains accelerate habitat degradation far removed from the place of consumption. Although adverse effects of economic prosperity and economic inequality have been confirmed(4,5), the importance of international trade as a driver of threats to species is poorly understood. Here we show that a significant number of species are threatened as a result of international trade along complex routes, and that, in particular, consumers in developed countries cause threats to species through their demand of commodities that are ultimately produced in developing countries. We linked 25,000 Animalia species threat records from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List to more than 15,000 commodities produced in 187 countries and evaluated more than 5 billion supply chains in terms of their biodiversity impacts. Excluding invasive species, we found that 30\% of global species threats are due to international trade. In many developed countries, the consumption of imported coffee, tea, sugar, textiles, fish and other manufactured items causes a biodiversity footprint that is larger abroad than at home. Our results emphasize the importance of examining biodiversity loss as a global systemic phenomenon, instead of looking at the degrading or polluting producers in isolation. We anticipate that our findings will facilitate better regulation, sustainable supply-chain certification and consumer product labelling.},

	abstract = {Interdisciplinary research in hydraulics and ecology for river management and restoration must integrate processes that occur over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, which presents a challenge to ecohydraulics modelers. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are being more widely used to determine flow fields for ecohydraulics applications. In the Upper Mississippi River (UMR), the mussel dynamics model was developed as a tool for management and conservation of freshwater mussels (Unionidae), which are benthic organisms, imperiled in North America, that are inextricably linked with the hydraulics of river flow. We updated the juvenile dispersal component of the mussel dynamics model by using stochastic Lagrangian particle tracking in a three dimensional flow field output from CFD models of reaches in the UMR. We developed a methodological framework to integrate hydrodynamic data with the mussel dynamics model, and we demonstrate the use of the juvenile dispersal model employed within the methodological framework in two reaches of the UMR. The method was used to test the hypothesis that impoundment affects the relationship of some hydraulic parameters with juvenile settling distribution. Simulation results were consistent with this hypothesis, and the relationships of bed shear stress and Froude number with juvenile settling were altered by impoundment most likely through effects on local hydraulics. The methodological framework is robust, integrates Eulerian and Lagrangian reference frameworks, and incorporates processes over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, from watershed scale hydrologic processes (decades), to reach scale (km) processes that occur over hours or days, and turbulent processes on spatial scales of meter to millimeter and times scales of seconds. The methods are presently being used to assess the impacts of pre- and early post-settlement processes on mussel distributions, including the effects of bed shear stress, and the sensitivity of the location of the host fish when juveniles excyst, on juvenile settling distribution.

Movement was most common in the upstream direction during summer, and about equal upstream and downstream between summers. Highest rates of movement occurred during and just after runoff, and before spawning, but substantial numbers of fish moved throughout the summer. Fish captured moving through weirs tended to be longer but in poorer condition than fish captured during electrofishing in 500-m reaches between weirs (i.e., the general population). On the basis of capture histories for individual fish, 59 and 66\% in the two streams moved at least 50 m (up to 3380 m), even though most could be tracked only for several months. Thus, significant proportions of fish in electrofishing samples spaced throughout the stream bore marks from locations up to 2000 m away, indicating that long-range movements were relatively common. This conclusion is contrary to most literature on resident stream salmonids. We show how methods commonly used to study movement may be seriously biased, and suggest that movement may be more widespread than currently recognized.},

In winter 2000 and summer 2001, we measured vertical hydrological gradient (VHG), dissolved oxygen, water temperature and water chemistry using mini-piezometers, each installed in a different upwelling or downwelling zone. Next to every piezometer, a freeze core sample was taken to quantify the sediment, particulate organic matter and invertebrates. 3. Dissolved oxygen concentration at 25 cm was high on both occasions ({\textgreater}9 mg L-1) but was higher in winter than summer. Interstitial water temperature was higher in down than upwellings and was substantially higher in summer than winter. Other features of the subsurface sediments and interstitial nitrate-nitrite concentrations were similar on both occasions and in up and downwellings. Interstitial ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorous concentrations were higher in winter than summer and ammonium was higher in up than downwelling areas. 4. The proportion of fine sediment (63 mum(-1) mm), sediment heterogeneity and VHG accounted for the greatest proportion of variance in invertebrate distributions in both summer and winter. 5. The hyporheos was numerically dominated by early instar leptophlebiid mayfly nymphs and asellotan isopods. Water mites were a taxonomically diverse group with 13 genera. Taxonomic diversity (Shannon-Weaver), but not taxon richness, was higher in upwelling areas, reflecting lower numerical dominance by a few taxa in these locations. 6.

Macroinvertebrates are an important component of biodiversity in stream ecosystems and studies of macroinvertebrate diversity in headwater streams have mostly viewed stream systems as linear reaches rather than as networks, although the latter may be more appropriate to the study of diversity patterns in headwater systems. 3. Studies of macroinvertebrate diversity in headwater streams from around the world illustrated that taxonomic richness is highly variable among continents and regions, and studies addressing longitudinal changes in taxonomic richness of macroinvertebrates generally found highest richness in mid-order streams. 4. When stream systems are viewed as networks at the landscape-scale, alpha-diversity may be low in individual headwater streams but high beta-diversity among headwater streams within catchments and among catchments may generate high gamma-diversity. 5. Differing ability and opportunity for dispersal of macroinvertebrates, great physical habitat heterogeneity in headwater streams, and a wide range in local environmental conditions may all contribute to high beta-diversity among headwater streams both within and among catchments. 6. Moving beyond linear conceptual models of stream ecosystems to consider the role that spatial structure of river networks might play in determining diversity patterns at the landscape scale is a promising avenue for future research.},

	volume = {30},
	abstract = {Given the unique spatial structure of stream habitat and the stochasticity characteristic of lotic ecosystems, metacommunity approaches hold much promise in the field of stream ecology. We take advantage of the tight parallels between neutral theories of molecular evolution and community assembly and present a novel conceptual approach to evaluating the role of stochasticity and dispersal limitation in structuring stream metacommunities. The analogous neutral frameworks generate similar expectations for the spatial structure of species comprising communities and genes comprising populations, particularly among patchily distributed, isolated local habitats (e.g., headwater streams) where among-stream dispersal is expected to be limited. Our emphasis is on the conceptual value of this approach, but we also used a limited data set composed of intensively sampled community and population-genetic data collected from 5 to 7 Rocky Mountain alpine streams for illustrative purposes. We characterized neutral population genetic structure as mitochondrial haplotype distributions for the blackfly Prosimulium neomacropyga, which shows strong genetic isolation by distance across the study region. We assessed community structure as the relative frequencies of ecologically similar species in the family Chironomidae collected annually over 2000-2003. Species richness was positively correlated with haplotype richness across streams (r = 0.55), and analogous methods revealed significant 3 diversity at both the population-genetic (F(ST) = 0.23) and the community (F(ST) = 0.16) levels. However, a more spatially explicit comparison of pairwise community dissimilarity and genetic distance revealed no evidence of correlation (Mantel test, r = -0.18, p = 0.54), a result suggesting no effect of spatial distance on community similarity at the relatively fine spatial scale of our study. We discuss 2 key arguments to explain the lack of community distance decay: 1) unaccounted environmental differences among streams, and 2) varying spatial and temporal scales of neutral processes (including genetic drift and ecological drift; i.e., stochastic temporal change) between population-genetic and community levels. Evidence for both selective and neutral explanations is compelling in this system. The explanations cannot be disentangled with the current data, but the study has strong heuristic value that we hope will stimulate future efforts in stream metacommunity analysis.},

	abstract = {Many aquatic organisms need to settle in suitable benthic habitats while being transported via water currents. Such settlement is especially challenging for organisms that encounter complex benthic topography and lack the ability to move easily from the water column to the bed (e.g., via swimming). We conducted flume studies to examine whether the settlement of drifting stream insects is facilitated by adhesive filaments that extend from their bodies. Using a new tripwire visualization technique, we found that neonatal black flies (Simulium tribulatum) drifted with silk threads averaging six times their body length. These threads allowed larvae to contact or snag the bed from a greater height than would be possible through direct body-to-bed contact alone, and instantly arrested their downstream movement. Thus, silk increased their probability of settlement. We then performed an experiment to examine how settlement varied with bed topography and velocity. We tested whether settlement rate differed between a flat bed and an irregular bed that mimicked key aspects of their natural cobble-bed habitat. Velocities were similar for both bed treatments. Settlement on the irregular bed was 40 times greater than on the flat bed due to silk use. Settlement rate also exhibited a marginally significant decline with increasingly velocity on the flat bed, but not on the irregular bed. Silk threads should greatly increase the settlement rate of these nonswimming larvae on coarse-grained stream beds. Thus, silk snagging can potentially reduce the downstream distance that individuals are transported during a drift event, although the effects of silk on other phases of larval dispersal may differ.},

High-gradient mountain streams are ideal for studying longitudinal biological patterns, although the degree of similarity in the biological gradient among physically similar streams in a region is poorly known. Our first objective was to evaluate variability in benthic communities along four streams in the central Rocky Mountains of Colorado. We analysed the relative influence of longitudinal position versus reach-scale physical variables on community structure and measured community similarity at comparable longitudinal positions on the four streams. 2. Our second objective was to evaluate the relative utility of taxonomically versus functionally defined communities to characterise assemblage structure: are taxonomic patterns more predictable along the gradient than are patterns of ecologically important species traits? 3. Redundancy analyses (RDA), including measures of both reach-scale environmental variables (substratum properties, periphytic cover, local channel slope) and longitudinal position (altitude, stream size), confirmed that the longitudinal position of a site was most important in determining taxonomic composition. Functional community structure was also influenced by longitudinal position, but reach-scale variables (especially periphyton and median particle size) were of greater importance. 4. Redundancy analyses explained 29.3 \% of total taxonomic variance and 26.0 \% of functional variance, indicating that defining assemblages functionally provides no greater understanding of community patterns given several known environmental variables. Strict longitudinal limits of taxa, the presumably identical regional species pool across our sites, and/or trade-offs among different types of species traits probably explain this result. 5. Redundancy analyses did suggest, however, that traits related to longer life (semivoltinism, long-lived adults, and slow larval development) were more common downstream, while long-distance dispersal ability and high fecundity were associated with higher altitude and its associated harsher conditions. 6. When sampling sites were grouped into three ecological zones defined by altitude, mean community similarity (measured both taxonomically and functionally) was lowest across streams at the highest altitude. This pattern could be driven by increased insularity of alpine-zone streams, resulting from a combination of harsh terrestrial environment, lack of hydrological connectivity, and limited species ranges along the longitudinal continuum.},

	abstract = {1. The alteration of stream habitats by urbanisation reduces the availability of shelter. Reduced shelter availability may increase both predation risks and metabolic costs, negatively affecting the growth performance of stream fish. Although urbanised streams often allow the establishment of invasive species, the additive or interactive effects of shelter availability and invasive species are rarely explored. The invasive red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) is a strong shelter competitor and predator in streams.
2. We conducted a stream-channel experiment to investigate how shelter availability and this invasive crayfish species affect the growth performance (measured as the loss in body mass under starved conditions) of two native benthic species, Japanese crucian carp (Carassius auratus complex) and an endangered cobitid fish (Lefua echigonia).
3. We found that both the absence of shelter and the presence of crayfish increased body mass loss in the crucian carp. However, the growth performance of the crucian carp was improved by the presence of shelter except in the presence of crayfish, in which case the shelter available did not ameliorate the negative effect of the crayfish on growth performance (i.e. an interactive effect). This result suggests that crayfish may affect the growth performance of the crucian carp through chemical cues as well as through shelter occupancy.
4. In contrast, shelter availability is the primary factor affecting the body mass loss of the cobitid fish. However, the growth performance of these fish was unaffected by the presence of crayfish. The change in the growth performance of the cobitid fish in response to the absence of shelter was greater than that of the crucian carp. This finding suggests that the cobitid fish may be more vulnerable than the crucian carp to a reduction in shelter availability.
5. Our study demonstrates that reduced shelter availability and/or crayfish invasion can have significant, indirect negative effects on the growth performance of native fish, but whether those effects are interactive might vary depending on the species. Our findings have clear implications for stream restoration and habitat assessment.},

	volume = {83},
	abstract = {Because male distribution and abundance strongly influence female fertilization success, density-dependent selection might act on gamete traits to maximize reproductive success. Intra- and interspecific variation in female fertilization success was investigated in the sea urchins Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, S. franciscanus, and S. droebachiensis. Male and female urchins of each species were induced to spawn within 25-m(2) plots. The percentage of eggs fertilized, along with six covariates (male density, male-female distance, number of males, surge velocity, advection, and water depth), was measured for each spawning event. S. purpuratus had the highest levels of fertilization (94\%), followed by S. franciscanus (64\%) and S. droebachiensis (23\%). The species with the highest densities, most males, and closest neighbors had the highest levels of fertilization. Depth and surge were not significant factors, but advection was associated with fertilization negatively in S. purpuratus and positively in S. drocbachiensis. This interaction is probably caused by the higher degree of clumping in S. purpuratus than in S. droebachiensis. An analysis of covariance indicates that the rank order of least-squares means of percentage fertilization for these three species is the opposite of that for the uncorrected species means. S. droebachiensis performs best and S. purpuratus performs worst, when conditions arc held equal. These differences in performance can best be explained by gamete traits. Additional experiments determined (1) that the 25-m(2) plot Size is the appropriate scale for investigation of patterns of fertilization in S. franciscanus, the species with the largest contiguous populations; (2) that S. purpuratus, the species commonly found in the intertidal and subtidal zones, had similarly high levels of fertilization in the two locations; and (3) that fertilization success in the experimental plots was similar to that during natural spawning events. These results are consistent with density-dependent selection on gamete traits. Gametes of the species that naturally occurs at the lowest population density and has the lowest natural fertilization rates have attributes that cause them to perform the best of the three under conditions of sperm limitation, and those of the species that occurs at the highest densities and has the highest levels of natural fertilization perform most efficiently under conditions of sperm competition. Historical demographic conditions appear to have resulted in selection on gamete traits to maximize reproductive success under conditions of either sperm limitation or sperm competition.},

	abstract = {1. The harlequin bug, a herbivore on bladderpod, is attacked by two specialist egg parasitoids Trissolcus murgantiae and Ooencyrtus johnsonii. Ooencyrtus can out-compete Trissolcus in the laboratory, but coexistence is the norm in field populations. Despite the heavy mortality inflicted by the two parasitoids, the host-parasitoid interaction is persistent in all sites that have been studied in southern California. 2. I manipulated inter-patch distances in a field experiment to determine whether spatial processes drive parasitoid coexistence and/or host-parasitoid dynamics. I first tested the hypothesis that the parasitoids coexist via a dispersal-competition trade-off. Both parasitoid species took significantly longer to colonize isolated patches than well-connected patches, suggesting that they have comparable dispersal abilities. Ooencyrtus did not exclude Trissolcus even when inter-patch distances were reduced to 25-30\% of those observed in natural populations. These data suggest that parasitoid coexistence can occur in the absence of a dispersal advantage to the inferior competitor. 3. Since the treatments with isolated vs. well-connected patches did not differ in parasitoid composition, I next asked whether isolation would destabilize, or drive extinct, the host-multiparasitoid interaction. No local extinctions of bugs or parasitoids were observed during the 18-month study period. Bug populations in the isolated patches were no more variable than those in the well-connected patches. In fact, temporal variability in the experimentally isolated patches was comparable to that observed in highly isolated natural populations. 4. These data argue against a strong effect of spatial processes on host-parasitoid dynamics. Local processes may mediate both parasitoid coexistence as well as the host-parasitoid interaction.},

	title = {Spatial dynamics of mutualistic interactions},
	volume = {73},
	abstract = {1. I present a model of mutualistic interactions in a patchy landscape. The interaction is between two species that differ in their mobility. The landscape is spatially structured, with several localities interconnected by dispersal of the mobile mutualist. 2. Within a given locality, an Allee effect can occur such that the per capita growth rate of the non-mobile mutualist declines with its own abundance. The Allee effect arises in response to low abundances of the mobile mutualist, and causes extinction of both species once their numbers fall below a critical threshold. 3. Dispersal of the mobile mutualist can rescue such sink communities from extinction, provided there is at least one source community in which both species have abundances above the extinction threshold. Dispersal itself is density-independent, but induces negative density-dependence that counteracts the positive density-dependence due to the Allee effect. This negative feedback effect of dispersal has not previously been demonstrated in mutualism models. 4. Rescue of sink communities, however, depends on how dispersal influences the local dynamics of source communities. If dispersal involves surplus individuals the loss of whom does not affect the reproductive output of the source community, persistence of sink communities is guaranteed as long as the survivorship of long-distance dispersers exceeds a lower threshold. In contrast, if dispersal involves emigrants that constitute a fraction of the source community's reproductive output, persistence of sink communities additionally requires that emigration does not exceed an upper threshold. Too much emigration can cause a net loss of the mobile mutualist from the source community, resulting in landscape-wide extinction of the mutualistic interaction. 5. The effect of dispersal mode on the dynamics of mutualistic interactions has not been appreciated previously. If the benefit of the rescue effect to sinks is outweighed by the cost of dispersal to sources, mutualistic communities linked by dispersal may experience a greater loss of diversity than communities that are isolated.},

The time taken to reach a steady state of settlement numbers varied between species and turbulence intensities. Normalized steady-state (NSS) settlement numbers showed differences among species. A settlement model, based on principles invoked in the analysis of motion of bed sediments in rivers, was developed. The model indicates that the NSS settlement number depends on two parameters, a propagule Reynolds number and an entrainment function that represents the relative importance of the shear stress experienced by settled propagules and their submerged weight. The inability of this model to collapse the data for all species suggests that the stickiness of the propagules, due to their mucus coatings, plays a significant role in the settlement process. P. limitata (largest propagules) exhibited the least effective attachment to the substratum, whereas F. gardneri (second largest) and D. antarctica (smallest propagules) were the most effective at withstanding hydrodynamic forces that detach propagules. We also model the boundary layer above a flat-bed, driven by linear water-waves, using a skin-friction drag coefficient and show that this study represents the lower end of the shear velocity u(*) range. However, these experiments capture the main region of variability in long-term propagule attachment, and indicate that most of these fucoid species will have successful settlement only during calm conditions.},

We examined small-scale spatial distributions of newly settled individuals on the Matsunase tidal flat, central Japan, during the low spring tides on two days 29th-30th June 2007, together with the shear stress from waves and currents on the flat. The characteristics of spatial distribution of newly settled Asari clam markedly varied depending on both of hydrodynamic and topographical conditions on the tidal flat. Using generalized linear models (GLMs), factors responsible for affecting newly settled Asari clam density and its spatial distribution were distinguished between sampling days, with "crest" sites always having a negative influence each on the density and the distribution on both sampling days. The continuously recorded data for the wave-current flows at the "crest" site on the tidal flat showed that newly settled Asari clam, as well as bottom sediment particles, at the "crest" site to be easily displaced.

In a mesocosm experiment, mussel effects on algae were linked through stable isotope analyses to mussel-derived nitrogen subsidies, but mussel biodiversity effects on algal accumulation were not significant. In contrast, mussel biodiversity significantly increased aquatic insect emergence rates, because aquatic insects were responding to mussel-induced changes in algal community structure instead of algal accumulation. In turn, mussel biodiversity also significantly increased terrestrial spider abundance as spiders tracked increases in aquatic insect prey after a reproduction event. In a comparative field study, we found that sites with greater mussel species richness had higher aquatic insect emergence rates. These results show that, because food webs in adjacent ecosystems are often linked, biodiversity effects in one ecosystem can influence adjacent ecosystems as well.},

	abstract = {We conducted two experiments in flow-through, artificial streams to examine how habitat structure affected drift and benthic resettlement of larval hydropsychid caddisflies (Ceratopsyche sparna). In the first experiment, we quantified drift distance and the number of times larvae re-entered the drift in 9.0 x 0.51-m channels with contiguous patches (ea. 2.5-m long) of biofilm-covered gravel, biofilm-covered cobbles ( Cladophora), and Cladophora-covered cobbles (+ Cladophora). In the second experiment, we tracked nocturnal movements of larvae after benthic settlement in 2.8 x 0.1-m channels, each containing one of the three habitat types. In experiment 1, drift distance was (1) greatest in gravel and lowest in cobbles + Cladophora, (2) inversely related to hydraulic roughness of habitats, (3) independent of body size, and (4) similar for live and dead larvae. Average drift distance was relatively short ({\textless}2.5 m), regardless of habitat type. Number of drift re-entries also varied among habitats, being greatest in gravel and lowest in cobbles + Cladophora. No larvae re-entered the drift after settling in Cladophora patches. Results from experiment 2 revealed that drift propensities were higher for larvae in biofilm-covered gravel and cobbles than in cobbles + Cladophora. Larvae remaining in substrate patches (i.e. not drifting) laid fewer draglines in biofilm-covered stones than in Cladophora patches. Extent of benthic movement (i.e., crawling) by non-drifting larvae did not differ significantly among habitats. However, distance moved did differ with flow direction, being 4 x greater downstream than upstream. These results highlight how local substrate and hydraulic conditions interact to affect small-scale movements of caddisfly larvae.},

	volume = {53},
	abstract = {1. Stream ecosystems are the products of interactions between hydrology, geomorphology and ecology, but examining all three components simultaneously is difficult and rarely attempted. Frequently, either geomorphology or hydrology is treated as invariable or static. 2. To examine the validity of treating either hydrology or geomorphology as static, we studied the individual and combined effects of hydrology and channel geomorphology on coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) storage. Using data from an experimental leaf release in a hydrologically regulated stream we created a simple numerical model. This allowed us to quantify the relative influence of CPOM trapping and CPOM retention on total long-term CPOM storage under variable regimes of flood frequency and geomorphic structure. 3. CPOM storage is a function of supply, flood frequency and the type and frequency of in-stream structures. In-stream structures perform two distinct functions, trapping and retention, whose relative importance in leaf storage changes with stream hydrology. Trapping is more important for CPOM storage in streams with few floods, while retention is more important in streams with frequent floods. Different structures (e.g. boulders, large wood, small wood) perform these functions at different efficiencies. We found that large wood trapped two to three times more leaves than the bank, but that the bank retained leaves two to three times more efficiently. 4. A modelled channel with five times the amount of large wood as the study channel (a 'wood restoration') initially stored 14\% more leaves than the modelled 'natural' channel. After six floods, however, the modelled wood restoration channel stored 50\% less CPOM than the natural channel as the large wood had high trapping but poor retention. The modelled natural channel contained structures that could both trap and retain. Thus, as different structures performed different functions, the structural complexity buffered the stream allochthonous energy base against changes in hydrology through its balance of trapping and retention. 5. As the frequency of floods increased, the spatial distribution of CPOM became increasingly patchy as storage was driven entirely by structures with high retention. Thus, the coupling of flood frequency and geomorphic structure influenced CPOM availability, which in turn has ramifications for the entire stream food web.},

In the one experiment in which cultured phytoplankton were added to filtered seawater so that initial fluorescence was much higher, significant vertical and substantial horizontal gradients in fluorescence developed.

	abstract = {Seafloor topographic complexity is ecologically important because it provides habitat structure and alters boundary-layer flow over the bottom. Despite its importance, there is little agreement on how to define and measure surface complexity. The purpose of this investigation was to utilize fractal geometry of vertical cross-section profiles to characterize the surface topography of the soft-bottom mussel bed (Mytilus edulis L.) at Bob's Cove, ME, USA. Mussels then have been shown previously to have spatially ordered fractal characteristics in the horizontal plane. Two hypotheses were tested. The first was that the bed surface is fractal over the spatial scale of 1.44-200 mm. with fractal dimension less than or equal to 1.26, the value for the Koch curve, our model for bed profiles. The second was that bed surface topography (i.e., in vertical profile) is less complex than the mussel bed spatial pattern (i.e., aerial view in the horizontal plane). Both hypotheses were supported. Cross-sections of plaster casts of the bed produced 88 surface profiles, all of which were fractal over the entire spatial scale of more two orders of magnitude employed in the analysis. Fractal dimension values (D) for individual profiles ranged from 1.031 to 1.310. Fractal dimensions of entire casts ranged up to mean (1.242 +/- 0.046) and median (1.251) values similar to 1.26, the theoretical value of the Koch curve. The bed surface was less complex than the bed spatial pattern because every profile had D {\textless} 1.36, the smallest value previously obtained from aerial views of the bed. The investigation demonstrated for the first time that surface topography of a soft-bottom mussel bed was fractal at a spatial scale relevant to hydrodynamic processes and habitat structure important for benthic organisms. The technique of using cross section profiles from casts of the bed surface avoided possible underestimates: of fractal dimension that can result from other profiling methods reported in the literature. The results demonstrate that fractal dimension can be useful in the analysis of habitat space and water flow over any irregular seafloor surface because it incorporates the size, shape, and scale of roughness elements into a simple, numerical metric.

	abstract = {1. Habitat complexity is thought to exert a significant influence on ecological communities, but its operation under variable natural conditions is not well understood, particularly in freshwater. To elucidate the role of habitat complexity, in particular the fractal structure of surface irregularity, in a stream system, field colonisation experiments were conducted at three times of year (summer, winter and spring) using natural substrates with different levels of fractal dimension in a small coastal mountain stream of southern Japan. 2. In the winter experiment, comparison was also made between the standard (control) treatment and the resource-preconditioning treatment whereby experimental plates were conditioned in the natural stream environment to allow the accumulation of potential food resources (algae and detritus) for 1 month prior to the experiment. 3. Species abundance patterns observed at different times of year showed little systematic variation with levels of habitat complexity but largely followed the patterns expected from, or lying in between, the Random Assortment model and the random fraction model. 4. Taxon richness and density increased with habitat complexity in all seasons except for density in spring. Different taxa showed different patterns of change with habitat complexity, which also varied with seasons. Biomass of invertebrates showed no systematic trend with an increase in habitat complexity. 5. Chlorophyll-a concentrations tended to be lower in more complex habitats, particularly in summer. In contrast, fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) tended to increase with habitat complexity. However, the relationship between these potential food resources and invertebrate assemblages remain unclear. 6. While there were no significant differences in taxon richness and biomass of invertebrates between the resource-preconditioning and the control treatment, density was higher in the former than in the latter. The abundance of relatively large, surface-dwelling animals showed more marked temporal variation over the entire period of colonisation in the resource-preconditioning treatment than in the control treatment. 7. Body size of invertebrates tended to decline with fractal complexity, indicating that crevice sizes could affect habitat use by benthic animals of different sizes. In addition, body size was larger in the resource-preconditioning treatment than in the control treatment, suggesting that body size in invertebrate assemblages was controlled by a mixture of factors. Thus, the present study demonstrates that habitat structure affects benthic invertebrate assemblages in a complex manner.},

	abstract = {1. The influence of hydraulic conditions on the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages was investigated in three riffles in a perennial Australian river. 2. Velocity, depth and variability of substrate roughness were measured at each of 56 macroinvertebrate sampling locations. Complex hydraulic variables (roughness Reynolds number, shear velocity, Froude number) were calculated from combinations of two or three of the directly measured variables. The biological significance of directly measured and complex hydraulic variables was determined by a combination of univariate and multivariate statistical procedures. 3. Macroinvertebrate abundance, number of taxa and community composition were significantly different between the identified roughness Reynolds number, Froude number, velocity and shear velocity microhabitats throughout the studied riffles. 4. Regression analysis showed macroinvertebrate abundance and number of taxa were negatively related to roughness Reynolds number, shear velocity, velocity and Froude number. Depth was negatively related to abundance. In general, the majority of the macroinvertebrate community preferred the areas of riffles with the lowest near-bed turbulence. 5. Roughness Reynolds number explained more of the spatial variation in invertebrate abundance, number of taxa and community composition than the other hydraulic variables, either directly measured or calculated. Of the directly measured variables, velocity had the greatest explanatory power, which was marginally less than roughness Reynolds number and shear velocity. 6. This study demonstrated that small-scale differences in hydraulic conditions created by combinations of velocity, depth and substrate roughness have an important role in the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages in riffle habitats.},

	abstract = {Changing environments can have divergent effects on biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships at alternating trophic levels. Freshwater mussels fertilize stream foodwebs through nutrient excretion, and mussel species-specific excretion rates depend on environmental conditions. We asked how differences in mussel diversity in varying environments influence the dynamics between primary producers and consumers. We conducted Weld experiments manipulating mussel richness under summer (low flow, high temperature) and fall (moderate flow and temperature) conditions, measured nutrient limitation, algal biomass and grazing chironomid abundance, and analyzed the data with non-transgressive overyielding and tripartite biodiversity partitioning analyses. Algal biomass and chironomid abundance were best explained by trait-independent complementarity among mussel species, but the relationship between biodiversity effects across trophic levels (algae and grazers) depended on seasonal differences in mussel species' trait expression (nutrient excretion and activity level). Both species identity and overall diversity effects were related to the magnitude of nutrient limitation. Our results demonstrate that biodiversity of a resource-provisioning (nutrients and habitat) group of species influences foodweb dynamics and that understanding species traits and environmental context are important for interpreting biodiversity experiments.},

The effects of gamete age, gamete concentration, and gamete contact time in the laboratory were used to model fertilization success in situ and compared with experimental fertilization rates in the field. Highest fertilization rates in vitro (80\%) were found for sperm concentrations in the range of 1 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(6).mL(-1). Fertilization rates of 48 +/- 1.7\% (95\% CI) were measured at separation distances of 2 m and dropped to 2.8 +/- 0.7\% (95\% CI) at 16 m downstream, agreeing closely with rates predicted by the model. Recruitment failures reported for South Australian populations of H. laevigata have occurred when densities fell below similar to 0.3 animals.m(-2), or mean nearest-neighbor distances between 1 and 2 m. This density corresponds well to critical nearest-neighbor distances for fertilization success. Stocks at higher densities are predicted to have higher fertilization rates (similar to 90\%) such that fertilization success is not a factor limiting recruitment.},

	abstract = {1. The spatial distribution of macroinvertebrate species was examined in relation to hydraulic and sedimentary conditions in a large gravel-bed river, the Fraser River, Canada. Mean annual discharge in the Fraser River is 2900 m(3) s(-1) and annual flood discharge, due to snowmelt in May and June, averages 8760 m(3) s(-1). 2. Invertebrates were sampled from four water depths (0.2, 0.5, 1.5, 3.0 m) at various levels of discharge that together captured the spatial and temporal variability of the physical habitat. Several hydraulic (near-bed shear velocity, Boundary Reynolds number, turbulence intensity, depth-averaged velocity, Froude number, Reynolds number) and substratum variables (mean grain size, Trask's sorting coefficient, Nikuradse's roughness, percentage of fine sediment, and Shields entrainment function) were measured for each sample of macroinvertebrates. Concentrations of fine and coarse particulate organic matter were also assessed. 3. The physical habitat was characterized by a major gradient of hydraulic conditions that corresponded positively with increasing water depth and accounted for 52\% of the total variation in the habitat data. Substratum conditions and the concentration of organic matter explained 24\% of the total variation in the habitat data. 4. The distribution of invertebrates was correlated significantly with hydraulic variables and suggests that hydraulic conditions represent a major physical gradient along which the benthic community is organized. The distribution of organic matter and substratum texture were also important for some species. The spatial distribution of most species reflected morphological and trophic suitability to particular habitat conditions. 5. Hydraulic stress associated with foraging and maintaining position, as well as organic matter retention in coarse substrata, are probable mechanisms affecting the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrates.},

	abstract = {1. In complex landscapes such as river networks, organisms usually face spatio-temporal heterogeneity and gradients in geomorphological, water, ecological or landscape characteristics are often observed at the catchment scale. These environmental variables determine developmental conditions for larval stages of freshwater insects and influence adult phenotypic characteristics. Environmental clines are therefore expected to generate morphological clines. Such a process has the potential to drive gradual geographical change in morphology-dependent life history traits, such as dispersal. 2. We studied the influence of aquatic and terrestrial environmental factors on morphological variations in Calopteryx splendens across the Loire drainage. To investigate these effects we took explicitly into account the hierarchical structure of the river network. 3. We analysed eight morphological traits. Results showed significant body size variation between tributaries and the presence of a morphological cline at the drainage scale. We observed an effect of pH and water temperature on body size. Individuals in downstream sites were larger than individuals in upstream sites, and adults whose larval stages were exposed to alkaline pH and high temperatures during summer were larger. 4. Body size affects flight abilities in insects. Thus, our results suggest that morphological clines may generate an asymmetric dispersal pattern along the downstream-upstream axis, downstream populations dispersing farther than upstream ones. Such a process is expected to influence population genetic structure at the drainage scale if larval drift and floods do not balance an asymmetrical dispersal pattern of adults along the downstream-upstream gradient. To assess the influence of environmental gradients on the variation of life history traits it is important to understand the population biology of freshwater insects, and more generally of riverine organisms. It is also essential to integrate such data in conservation or restoration programmes.},

Second, the dynamics observed can often be ascribed to two or more of the four non-exclusive paradigms. Third, empirical approaches relate only weakly to the concise assumptions and predictions made by the paradigms. Consequently, we suggest major avenues of improvement for empirical metacommunity approaches, including the integration across theoretical approaches and the incorporation of evolutionary and meta-ecosystem dynamics.

In land snails, a single gene for left-right reversal could be responsible for instant speciation, because dextral and sinistral snails have difficulty in mating. However, the traditional two-locus speciation model predicts that a mating disadvantage for the reversal should counteract this speciation. In this study, we show that specialized snake predation of the dextral majority drives prey speciation by reversal. Our experiments demonstrate that sinistral Satsuma snails (Stylommatophora: Camaenidae) survive predation by Pareas iwasakii (Colubroidea: Pareatidae). Worldwide biogeography reveals that stylommatophoran snail speciation by reversal has been accelerated in the range of pareatid snakes, especially in snails that gain stronger anti-snake defense and reproductive isolation from dextrals by sinistrality. Molecular phylogeny of Satsuma snails further provides intriguing evidence of repetitive speciation under snake predation. Our study demonstrates that a speciation gene can be fixed in populations by positive pleiotropic effects on survival.},

Our results demonstrate that environmental context (temperature) combined with the functional traits of dominant species interactively influence the performance and services provided by other species, and that these shifts can have heightened effects on multiple compartments within an ecosystem.

	abstract = {Water resource development in coastal river catchments contributes to poor fish assemblage health due to the effects of barriers to migration and altered flow regimes. Impacts of migration barriers on fish assemblages depend primarily on the location of each barrier within the river network and migration needs of regional fish fauna. This study examined how temporal and spatial patterns in the distribution and composition of fish assemblages was associated with varying estuarine connectivity and migration barriers in higher altitude reaches in the eastern Hunter River catchment, temperate Australia. Species richness and abundances of diadromous species were expected to be greater in a tributary catchment with unrestricted connectivity to the Hunter River estuary when compared to a neighbouring tributary catchment with restricted connectivity. Six diadromous species were sampled only, or in greater abundances, in the unrestricted tributary when compared to the restricted tributary. As a consequence, assemblage composition in the restricted tributary was dominated by non-diadromous species. Greater abundances of the amphidromous Cox's gudgeon (Gobiomorphus coxii) were sampled in the unrestricted tributary following their estuarine-freshwater upstream juvenile migration period when compared to the restricted tributary. Differences in the accumulations of migratory species immediately downstream of upland barriers between the two levels of estuary connectivity indicate that migration barriers in lowland reaches have significant effects throughout the entire catchment. Results of this study indicate that the location of each barrier to migration within river networks has varying consequences for catchment-scale connectivity loss and assessing the impacts of multiple barriers. Determining the effects and most appropriate management of migration barriers requires that all obstructions within a river network are recognised, as multiple barriers can have cumulative and interacting consequences for freshwater fish fauna, especially diadromous species.

We investigated effects of the interaction between habitat availability and subsidy level on populations of a riparian fishing spider, Dolomedes aquaticus, using a flood disturbance gradient in the Waimakariri River catchment, New Zealand. D. aquaticus predominantly eat aquatic prey as they hunt from the water surface. However, D. aquaticus biomass peaked at rivers with intermediate flood disturbance, rather than at less flood-prone rivers where the biomass of aquatic insect prey was markedly higher. Flooding positively influenced spider habitat quality, and an experimental manipulation at stable rivers indicated that unembedded cobbles, preferred D. aquaticus habitat, were a limiting factor, preventing response to the increased prey resource at stable sites. Potential terrestrial prey abundance was low, did not vary across the disturbance gradient, and is likely to have been a much smaller component of the fishing spiders' diet than aquatic insect prey. Thus landscape-driven factors not only controlled the magnitude of resource subsidies, but also influenced the ability of consumers to respond to them by altering the physical nature of the ecosystem boundary.},

	volume = {13},
	abstract = {Six physical and hydrological variables were used to assess environmental stability at sites on 10 contrasting streams in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. Five of the streams were spring-fed and initially designated ''stable'', and the others, which were predominantly catchment-fed, were designated ''unstable''. At each site, depth, current velocity, and water temperature were measured monthly for 19 mo, and the distances moved by marked stones in three size groups were determined over 18 mo. Stone invertebrate communities were sampled at each site at three monthly intervals. Tractive force measurements and the Pfankuch stability index were also calculated. Monthly depth and current variability, temperature range, Pfankuch stability scores, and substrate movement were all greater at the five ''unstable'' sites, but the rank order of sites obtained with each measure was not consistent. Tractive force was the only stability measure that did not differ significantly between ''stable'' and ''unstable'' streams. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to combine values for all six variables into single multivariate instability scores (PCA scores for Axis 1). These scores were strongly correlated with all individual stability variable scores with the exception of those for tractive force. We suggest that the effects of environmental stability on community structure should be assessed using a measure that is representative of all the physical characteristics at a study site, and we believe the multivariate instability score goes some way towards achieving this. Such a procedure, however, does not negate the use of individual measures for examining specific environmental relationships as well. Although differences in the persistence of some community characteristics could be detected using the initial ''stable/unstable'' groups, others could only be seen when plotted on a more continuous scale using the multivariate instability scores. Persistence of the dominant invertebrate taxa was high at all sites, but persistence of the entire fauna was higher at the stable sites.},

	abstract = {One of the oldest questions in ecology is how species diversity in any given trophic level is related to the availability of essential resources that limit biomass (e.g. water, nutrients, light or prey). Researchers have tried to understand this relationship by focusing either on how diversity is influenced by the availability of resources, or alternatively, how resource abundance is influenced by species diversity. These contrasting perspectives have led to a seeming paradox '... is species diversity the cause or the consequence of resources that limit community biomass?' Here we present results of an experiment that show it is possible for species diversity and resource density to exhibit reciprocal causal relationships in the same ecological system. Using a guild of ladybeetle predators and their aphid prey, we manipulated the number of predator species in field enclosures to examine how predator diversity impacts prey population size. At the same time, we manipulated the abundance of aphid prey in discrete habitat patches within each enclosure to determine how smaller-scale spatial variation in resource abundance affects the number of co-occurring predator species. We found that the number of ladybeetle species added to enclosures had a significant impact on aphid population dynamics because interference competition among the predators reduced per capita rates of predation and, in turn, the overall efficiency of the predator guild. At the same time, spatial variation in aphid abundance among smaller habitat patches generated variation in the observed richness of ladybeetles because more species occurred in patches where predators aggregated in response to high aphid density. The results of our experiment demonstrate that it is possible for species diversity to simultaneously be a cause and a consequence of resource density in the same ecological system, and they shed light on how this might occur for groups of mobile consumers that exhibit rapid responses to spatial and temporal variation in their prey.},

	abstract = {Univariate explanations of biodiversity have often failed to account for broad-scale patterns in species richness. As a result, increased attention has been paid to the development and testing of more synthetic multivariate hypotheses. One class of multivariate hypotheses, founded in successional diversity theory, predict that species richness is jointly influenced by periodic disturbances that create new niche opportunities in space or time, and the production of community biomass that speeds displacement of inferior by superior competitors. While the joint response of diversity to disturbance and productivity has gained support from theoretical and small-scale experimental studies, evidence that corresponding patterns of biodiversity occur broadly across natural systems is scarce. Using a data set that employed standardized methods to sample 85 streams throughout the mid-Atlantic United States of America, we show that biogeographical patterns of primary producer diversity in stream ecosystems are consistent with the predictions of a multivariate model that incorporates disturbance frequency and community biomass production as independent variables. Periphyton species richness is a concave-down function of disturbance frequency (mean no. floods year(-1)) and of biomass production (mu g of biomass accrual cm(-2) day(-1)), and an increasing function of their interaction. Changes in richness across the disturbance x productivity response surface can be related to several predicted life-history traits of the dominant species. Our findings complement prior studies by showing that multivariate models which consider interactive effects of community production and ecosystem disturbance are, in fact, candidate explanations of much broader patterns of richness in natural systems. Because multivariate models predict synergistic effects of ecological variables on species diversity, human activities - which are simultaneously altering both the disturbance regime and productivity of streams - could be influencing biodiversity more than previously anticipated.},

	volume = {443},
	abstract = {Over the past decade, accelerating rates of species extinction have prompted an increasing number of studies to reduce species diversity experimentally and examine how this alters the efficiency by which communities capture resources and convert those into biomass(1,2). So far, the generality of patterns and processes observed in individual studies have been the subjects of considerable debate(3-7). Here we present a formal meta-analysis of studies that have experimentally manipulated species diversity to examine how it affects the functioning of numerous trophic groups in multiple types of ecosystem. We show that the average effect of decreasing species richness is to decrease the abundance or biomass of the focal trophic group, leading to less complete depletion of resources used by that group. At the same time, analyses reveal that the standing stock of, and resource depletion by, the most species-rich polyculture tends to be no different from that of the single most productive species used in an experiment. Of the known mechanisms that might explain these trends, results are most consistent with what is called the 'sampling effect', which occurs when diverse communities are more likely to contain and become dominated by the most productive species. Whether this mechanism is widespread in natural communities is currently controversial. Patterns we report are remarkably consistent for four different trophic groups ( producers, herbivores, detritivores and predators) and two major ecosystem types ( aquatic and terrestrial). Collectively, our analyses suggest that the average species loss does indeed affect the functioning of a wide variety of organisms and ecosystems, but the magnitude of these effects is ultimately determined by the identity of species that are going extinct.},

	volume = {90},
	abstract = {The idea that productivity regulates species diversity is deeply ingrained in the field of ecology. Yet, over the past few decades, an increasing number of experiments have shown that species diversity controls, rather than simply responds to, biomass production. These contrasting perspectives have led to a seeming paradox: Is diversity the cause or the consequence of biological production? Here we present empirical evidence for the multivariate productivity-diversity (MPD) hypothesis, which argues that differing perspectives on productivity-diversity relationships can be resolved by recognizing that historical research has focused on how resource supply regulates both the productivity and richness of local competitors, whereas more recent studies have focused on how the richness of a colonist pool regulates the efficiency by which resources are captured and converted into new tissue. The MPD hypothesis predicts that three pathways operate concurrently to generate productivity-diversity relationships in nature: (1) resource supply directly limits the standing biomass and/or rate of new production by primary producers, (2) producer biomass is directly influenced by the richness of species that locally compete for resources, and (3) resource supply rate indirectly affects producer biomass by influencing the fraction of species from a colonist pool that locally coexist. To examine whether this set of pathways explains covariation between productivity and diversity in natural streams, we used nutrient-diffusing agar "patches'' to manipulate resource supply rates in 20 streams throughout the Sierra Nevada mountain range, California, USA. We then measured the fraction of periphyton species from the stream colonist pool co-occurring on each nutrient patch, as well as the standing biomass and rates of primary production. Natural patterns of covariation agreed with predictions of the MPD hypothesis. Algal biomass was an increasing function of nutrient supply, and an increasing function of local richness. The fraction of species from the colonist pool found co-occurring on a patch was a concave-down function of nutrient supply, causing nutrients to indirectly affect biomass via control over local richness. These results suggest that the MPD hypothesis is a viable explanation of patterns of diversity and productivity in natural stream ecosystems, and that it has potential to merge the historical view that productivity drives diversity with a parallel view that diversity drives productivity.},

	volume = {12},
	abstract = {One of the oldest and richest questions in biology is that of how species diversity is related to the availability of resources that limit the productivity of ecosystems. Researchers from a variety of disciplines have pursued this question from at least three different theoretical perspectives. Species energy theory has argued that the summed quantities of all resources influence species richness by controlling population sizes and the probability of stochastic extinction. Resource ratio theory has argued that the imbalance in the supply of two or more resources, relative to the stoichiometric needs of the competitors, can dictate the strength of competition and, in turn, the diversity of coexisting species. In contrast to these, the field of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning has argued that species diversity acts as an independent variable that controls how efficiently limited resources are utilized and converted into new tissue. Here we propose that all three of these fields give necessary, but not sufficient, conditions to explain productivity-diversity relationships (PDR) in nature. However, when taken collectively, these three paradigms suggest that PDR can be explained by interactions among four distinct, non-interchangeable variables: (i) the overall quantity of limiting resources, (ii) the stoichiometric ratios of different limiting resources, (iii) the summed biomass produced by a group of potential competitors and (iv) the richness of co-occurring species in a local competitive community. We detail a new multivariate hypothesis that outlines one way in which these four variables are directly and indirectly related to one another. We show how the predictions of this model can be fit to patterns of covariation relating the richness and biomass of lake phytoplankton to three biologically essential resources (N, P and light) in a large number of Norwegian lakes.},

This so-called "catastrophic drift" leads to a major redistribution of animals, as well as reduced fitness and increased mortality among drifters. We present the first field evidence of the role of sediment movement in triggering catastrophic drift. Experiments indicate that the loss of invertebrates from the bed becomes exponential when shear stress reaches the threshold that entrains bedload. However, we found that low rates of bedload are sufficient to rapidly denude patches of riverbed of their invertebrates and so trigger mass drift. Such low bedload rates occur during small floods. As small floods occur frequently, our results suggest that episodes of catastrophic drift are frequent. This conclusion is counterintuitive, as the persistence of invertebrate communities on riverbeds suggests that such events cannot be truly catastrophic. Moreover, the drift losses that we observed occurred in the absence of significant geomorphic disturbance; this is inconsistent with the notion of catastrophic drift being a response to hydrological disturbance events. We argue that a new definition of catastrophic drift is needed, a definition based not on drift magnitude or the triggering role of sediment movement, but on the population consequences of downstream displacement.},

	volume = {137},
	abstract = {Extinction risk is not evenly distributed among all species. Therefore, identifying shared characteristics of species that have shown serious population declines and range contractions can help to predict which types of species are likely to be vulnerable to extinction. The present study investigates ecological and life-history traits related to range contractions among breeding birds in Japan. Recent changes in nationwide distribution of each species were estimated using data from distributional surveys of breeding area in Japanese birds (1978 and 1998-2002). The Phylogenetic generalised least squares model revealed that the species with the following five traits have experienced particularly severe range contractions: medium body size, low annual productivity, solitary breeding, occurrence on farmland, and long-distance migration. Earlier theoretical studies have revealed that species with medium body sizes and low annual productivities are vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. Thus, results from the present study, which showed a decline in species with those two traits, may be indicating that habitat loss and fragmentation play an important role in range contractions in Japanese birds too. Whether, and through which mechanisms, coloniality reduces extinction risks of populations remains to be investigated. A large number of studies, mainly in Europe, have revealed the mechanisms behind the declines in farmland birds and long-distance migrants. In Japan, however, few studies have explored the processes through which such species decline. Direct causes of population declines in species sharing traits associated with range contractions need to be investigated urgently so that appropriate conservation measures can be taken.

	volume = {98},
	abstract = {Heterogeneity of species interactions in food webs can result from characteristics of substrates as well as attributes of top consumers. We performed a streamside channel experiment to evaluate the impact of crayfish on lower trophic levels in detritus-based (leaf packs) and algal-based food webs (hard-bottoms). After 43 days, both male and female crayfish had dramatically promoted leaf decomposition, with males processin material at a faster rate. However, the difference in leaf processing rates was not related to a greater level of male activity. Despite the sex-related difference in residual leaf dry mass, densities of invertebrates in leaf packs were similarly low in the presence of crayfish of either sex, due to resource consumption, physical dislodgment (bioturbation) and/or predation. No trophic cascade was evident in the leaf pack assemblage. In the hard-bottom assemblage, the results confirmed circumstantial field evidence that crayfish reduce predatory Tanypodinae and indirectly increase collector-gatherer Chironominae following the prediction of a trophic cascade. However, no other taxa were indirectly facilitated, because of strong direct effects of crayfish on algal abundance (through direct consumption and bioturbation). Overall, impacts of crayfish on lower trophic levels were more pronounced in the structurally complex, detritus-based assemblages than in its hard-bottom, algal-based counterpart. This conflicts with the expectation that net predation effects should be weaker where structural complexity is greater but is mainly a consequence of the profound engineering effects of crayfish in reducing colonisable substrate when they shred and disturb detrital material. Effects of crayfish may therefore propagate differently and with varying strength depending on substrate. Moreover, engineering activities and predation by crayfish appear to have been of overwhelming significance with subtle sex differences in leaf processing rates failing to lead to differences in invertebrate densities.},

	volume = {85},
	abstract = {Two field experiments were performed to examine the impacts on stream invertebrates of crayfish (Paranephrops zealandicus). as predators and bioturbators. A density manipulation experiment involved three treatments with different crayfish densities in streamside channels (0, 5, and 10 crayfish/m(2)) in which accrual of fine sediment, leaf decomposition, and associated invertebrates were measured. During the 50-d experiment, leaf decomposition was not affected by the presence of crayfish, whereas fine sediment was reduced to similar extents in both crayfish treatments. Some invertebrates followed a similar pattern to that of sediment accrual, suggesting that removal of fine sediment by crayfish was a primary mechanism underlying differences in invertebrate densities. Medium (4-6 mm body length) and large (greater than or equal to7 mm) Tanypodinae were rare in crayfish treatments, probably as a result of selective predation. Conversely, crayfish appeared to facilitate Deleatidium mayflies, as predicted by a trophic cascade (large Tanypodinae predator removal) or shredder-collector facilitation (fine particulate organic matter production). In many cases, the response of dependent variables was equally strong at both crayfish densities. In a sediment flush experiment, sediment removal treatments were established, along with no-crayfish control and crayfish treatments, to assess the relative impacts of predation and sediment removal on each invertebrate taxon. Crayfish had little impact on leaf decomposition, although decomposition rate was significantly faster than in sediment flush treatments, where collector-scraper invertebrates were reduced as a result of sediment removal. Despite the, fact that fine sediment was similarly reduced in crayfish and flush treatments, the response of invertebrates to treatments differed according to invertebrate taxon and size class. Overall, large Tanypodinae were selectively preyed upon; Orthocladiinae, Oribatei, and Oligochaeta responded primarily to sediment removal; Deleatidium were indirectly facilitated; and Chironominae, Ostracoda, and Cyclopoida were relatively:unaffected. These results are likely to be relevant at various levels of local scale in the natural environment, but not at the catchment scale. Crayfish are therefore considered to play important roles in determining local distribution of invertebrates through both trophic and nontrophic effects.},

	abstract = {1. The term 'catastrophic drift' is used to describe the large-scale displacement of invertebrates that occurs during periods of increased river discharge. However, the physical processes that lead to animals entering the water column at such times remain poorly understood. Specifically, the hypothesis that the movement of bed sediments during floods triggers a large increase in drift has lacked a rigorous field test. 2. Using a portable flume, the hydraulic conditions and rates of bedload transport associated with small, frequent floods were created in situ within a reach of a gravel bed river. Experiments focussed on the patches of fine sediment which are the dominant source of bed material transported during small floods. The flume produced near bed velocities of up to 2 m s(-1) over the patches, increasing shear stress, initiating sediment transport and causing invertebrates to enter the drift. 3. The total number of individuals lost from the bed, as well as the taxonomic composition of the drift, were influenced strongly by shear stress and bedload. The rate of loss from the bed was low at shear stresses {\textless} 9 dynes cm(-2) (0-4 individuals min(-1) from the 0.5 m(2) flume bed area). Once shear stress exceeded 9 dynes cm(-2), the threshold that resulted in consistent bedload transport from the patches, the rate of loss of animals increased to a maximum of 56 individuals min(-1). When bedload transport rates were at their highest, the taxonomic composition of the drift was more similar to the benthos than it was to the drift observed when bed material was stable. 4. Absolute rates of bedload transport created by the manipulations were extremely low ({\textless} 7 g m(-1) s(-1)) and typical of those measured during small, frequent floods. Events of this magnitude do not break up the armour layer across the reach as a whole and so exposed patches of fine sediment are the principal source of bedload material. Consequently, discharge events not considered as disturbances in geomorphic terms may initiate frequent episodes of so-called 'catastrophic drift' from patches of stream bed.},

	abstract = {Detailed empirical models predicting both species occurrence and fitness across a landscape are necessary to understand processes related to population persistence. Failure to consider both occurrence and fitness may result in incorrect assessments of habitat importance leading to inappropriate management strategies. We took a two-stage approach to identifying critical nesting and brood-rearing habitat for the endangered Greater Sage-Grouse ( Centrocercus urophasianus) in Alberta at a landscape scale. First, we used logistic regression to develop spatial models predicting the relative probability of use ( occurrence) for Sage-Grouse nests and broods. Secondly, we used Cox proportional hazards survival models to identify the most risky habitats across the landscape. We combined these two approaches to identify Sage- Grouse habitats that pose minimal risk of failure ( source habitats) and attractive sink habitats that pose increased risk ( ecological traps). Our models showed that Sage- Grouse select for heterogeneous patches of moderate sagebrush cover ( quadratic relationship) and avoid anthropogenic edge habitat for nesting. Nests were more successful in heterogeneous habitats, but nest success was independent of anthropogenic features. Similarly, broods selected heterogeneous high- productivity habitats with sagebrush while avoiding human developments, cultivated cropland, and high densities of oil wells. Chick mortalities tended to occur in proximity to oil and gas developments and along riparian habitats. For nests and broods, respectively, approximately 10\% and 5\% of the study area was considered source habitat, whereas 19\% and 15\% of habitat was attractive sink habitat. Limited source habitats appear to be the main reason for poor nest success ( 39\%) and low chick survival ( 12\%). Our habitat models identify areas of protection priority and areas that require immediate management attention to enhance recruitment to secure the viability of this population. This novel approach to habitat- based population viability modeling has merit for many species of concern.},

	abstract = {A principal challenge of species conservation is to identify the specific habitats that are essential for long-term persistence or recovery of imperiled species. However, many commonly used approaches to identify important habitats do not provide direct insight into the contribution of those habitats to population persistence. To assess how habitats contribute to overall population viability and characterize their relative importance, a spatially-explicit population viability model was used to integrate a species occurrence model with habitat quality and demographic information to simulate the population dynamics of the Ord's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii) in Alberta, Canada. Long-term productivity (births deaths) in each patch was simulated and iterative patch removal experiments were conducted to generate estimates of the relative contribution of habitat types to overall population viability. Our results indicated that natural dune habitats are crucial for population viability, while disturbed/human-created habitats make a minor contribution to population persistence. The results also suggest that the habitats currently available to Ord's kangaroo rats in Alberta are unlikely to support long-term persistence. Our approach was useful for identifying habitats that did not contribute to population viability. A large proportion of habitat (39\%) represented sinks and their removal increased estimated population viability. The integration of population dynamics with habitat quality and occurrence data can be invaluable when assessing critical habitat, particularly in regions with variable habitat quality. Approaches that do not incorporate population dynamics may undermine conservation efforts by under- or over-estimating the value of habitats, erroneously protecting sink habitats, or failing to prioritize key source habitats.

	volume = {91},
	abstract = {Dispersal influences ecological dynamics, evolution, biogeography, and biodiversity conservation, but models of larval dispersal in marine organisms make simplifying assumptions that are likely to approximate poorly the temporal dynamics of larval survival and capacity for settlement. In particular, larval mortality rates are typically assumed to be constant throughout larval life; and all larvae are frequently assumed to acquire and lose competence at the same time. To improve upon these assumptions, we here develop simple models of dispersal potential that incorporate rates of mortality, and acquisition and loss of settlement competence. We fit these models to empirical competence and survival data for five scleractinian coral species, to test the models' ability to characterize empirical survival and competence patterns, and to estimate the dispersal potential implied by those patterns. The models fit the data well, incorporating qualitative features of competence and survival that traditional approaches to modeling dispersal do not, with important implications for dispersal potential. Most notably, there was high within-cohort variation in the duration of the competent period in all species, and this variation increases both self-recruitment and long-distance dispersal compared with models assuming a fixed competent period. These findings help to explain the seeming paradox of high genetic population structure, coupled with large geographic range size, observed in many coral species. More broadly, our approach offers a way to parsimoniously account for variation in competence dynamics in dispersal models, a phenomenon that our results suggest has important effects on patterns of connectivity in marine metapopulations.},

	abstract = {Species dispersal is a central component of metapopulation models. Spatially realistic metapopulation models, such as stochastic patch-occupancy models (SPOMs), quantify species dispersal using estimates of colonization potential based on inter-patch distance (distance decay model). In this study we compare the parameterization of SPOMs with dispersal and patch dynamics quantified directly from empirical data. For this purpose we monitored two metapopulations of an endangered minnow, redside dace (Clinostomus elongatus), using mark-recapture techniques across 43 patches, re-sampled across a 1 year period. More than 2,000 fish were marked with visible implant elastomer tags coded for patch location and dispersal and patch dynamics were monitored. We found that species-specific dispersal and distance decay models provided qualitatively similar rankings of viable patches; however, there were differences of several orders of magnitude in the estimated intrinsic mean times to extinction, from 24 and 148 years to 362 and {\textgreater} 100,000 years, depending on the population. We also found that the rate of regional stochasicity had a dramatic impact for the estimate of species viability, and in one case altered the trajectory of our metapopulation from viable to non-viable. The divergent estimates in time to extinction times were likely due to a combination species-specific behavior, the dendritic nature of stream metapopulations, and the rate of regional stochasticity. We demonstrate the importance of developing comparative analyses using species- and patch-specific data when determining quantitative estimates for mean time to extinction, which in the case of redside dace, were highly sensitive to different estimates of dispersal.},

	abstract = {1. River systems offer special environments for the dispersal of aquatic plants because of the unidirectional (downstream) flow and linear arrangement of suitable habitats. 2. To examine the effect of this flow on microevolutionary processes in the unbranched bur-reed (Sparganium emersum) we studied the genetic variation within and among nine (sub)populations along a 103 km stretch of the Niers River (Germany-The Netherlands), using amplified fragment length polymorphisms. 3. Genetic diversity in S. emersum populations increased significantly downstream, suggesting an effect of flow on the pattern of intrapopulation genetic diversity. 4. Gene flow in the Niers River is asymmetrically bidirectional, with gene flow being approximately 3.5 times higher in a downstream direction. The observed asymmetry is probably caused by frequent hydrochoric dispersal towards downstream locations on the one hand, and sporadic zoochoric dispersal in an upstream direction on the other. The spread of vegetative propagules (leaf and stem fragments) is probably not an important mode of dispersal for S. emersum, suggesting that gene flow is mainly via seed dispersal. Realized dispersal distances exceeded 60 km, revealing a potential for long-distance dispersal in S. emersum. 5. There was no correlation between geographical and genetic distances among the nine S. emersum populations (i.e. no isolation by distance), which may be due to the occurrence of long-distance dispersal and/or colonization and extinction dynamics in the Niers River. 6. Overall, the genetic population structure and regional dispersal patterns of S. emersum in the Niers River are best explained by a linear metapopulation model. Our study shows that flow can exert a strong influence on population genetic processes of plants inhabiting stream systems.},

	abstract = {Japan's only native crayfish species Cambaroides japonicus has been declining dramatically in the past few decades. For the purpose of conservation planning, twenty-two coastal streams were surveyed to investigate summer distributions of crayfish in relation to stream and riparian environment. Classification and regression trees were used to predict the occurrence and abundance of crayfish. The classification tree model with stream variables as predictors showed that crayfish would occur in swift or high gradient streams (correct classification rate = 91\%). Within those streams, however, crayfish only inhabited depositional microhabitats, in which the areas are limited in availability. Crayfish were not found in gentle, low gradient streams containing abundant depositional microhabitats. This paradoxical distribution pattern was attributed to availability of boulder substrates in swift or high gradient streams. The regression tree model indicated that crayfish abundance was determined primarily by the percentage of boulder substrates and the presence of fish (observed vs. predicted r = 0.64). The classification tree model using only riparian variables indicated that the total woody plant (mainly broadleaf species) density followed by the percentage of early successional species such as alder and willow determined the splits of the tree model (correct classification rate = 95\%). A leaf processing experiment on 10 riparian plant species suggested that crayfish preferred high nitrogen (or low C/N) leaves. These results suggest that swift or high gradient fishless streams associated with abundant cover in dense broadleaf forest serve conservation areas for this endangered crayfish, and that consideration of riparian composition may facilitate conservation efforts.

	abstract = {Replacement of a native species by a nonnative can have strong effects on ecosystem function, such as altering nutrient cycling or disturbance frequency. Replacements may cause shifts in ecosystem function because nonnatives establish at different biomass, or because they differ from native species in traits like foraging behavior. However, no studies have compared effects of wholesale replacement of a native by a nonnative species on subsidies that support consumers in adjacent habitats, nor quantified the magnitude of these effects. We examined whether streams invaded by nonnative brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in two regions of the Rocky Mountains, USA, produced fewer emerging adult aquatic insects compared to paired streams with native cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii), and whether riparian spiders that depend on these prey were less abundant along streams with lower total insect emergence. As predicted, emergence density was 36\% lower from streams with the nonnative fish. Biomass of brook trout was higher than the cutthroat trout they replaced, but even after accounting for this difference, emergence was 24\% lower from brook trout streams. More riparian spiders were counted along streams with greater total emergence across the water surface. Based on these results, we predicted that brook trout replacement would result in 6-20\% fewer spiders in the two regions. When brook trout replace cutthroat trout, they reduce cross-habitat resource subsidies and alter ecosystem function in stream-riparian food webs, not only owing to increased biomass but also because traits apparently differ from native cutthroat trout.},

Introduced species are known to have direct effects on organisms within invaded communities. However, few studies have addressed the indirect effects of nonnative species in donor systems on organisms in recipient systems. We studied the direct role of introduced trout in altering a lake-derived resource subsidy and their indirect effects in altering a passerine bird's response to that subsidy. We compared the abundance of aquatic insects and foraging Gray-crowned Rosy-Finches (Leucosticte tephrocotis dawsoni, "Rosy-Finch'') at fish-containing vs. fishless lakes in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California (USA). Introduced trout outcompeted Rosy-Finches for emerging aquatic insects (i.e., mayflies). Fish-containing lakes had 98\% fewer mayflies than did fishless lakes. In lakes without fish, Rosy-Finches showed an aggregative response to emerging aquatic insects with 5.9 times more Rosy-Finches at fishless lakes than at fish-containing lakes. Therefore, the introduction of nonnative fish into the donor system reduced both the magnitude of the resource subsidy and the strength of cross-boundary trophic interactions. Importantly, the timing of the subsidy occurs when Rosy-Finches feed their young. If Rosy-Finches rely on aquatic-insect subsidies to fledge their young, reductions in the subsidy by introduced trout may have decreased Rosy-Finch abundances from historic levels. We recommend that terrestrial recipients of aquatic subsidies be included in conservation and restoration plans for ecosystems with alpine lakes.},

Reproduction occurs only in the stationary phase. Examples of such systems are found in rivers and streams, marine currents, and areas with prevalent wind direction. In streams, a long-standing question, dubbed 'the drift paradox', asks why aquatic insects faced with downstream drift are able to persist in upper stream reaches. For our two-phase model, persistence of the population is guaranteed if, at low population densities, the local growth rate of the stationary component of the population exceeds the rate of entry of individuals into the drift. Otherwise the persistence condition involves all the model parameters, and persistence requires a critical (minimum) domain size. We calculate the rate at which invasion fronts propagate up- and downstream, and show that persistence and ability to spread are closely connected: if the population cannot advance upstream against the flow, it also cannot persist on any finite spatial domain. By studying two limiting cases of our model, we show that residence in the immobile state always enhances population persistence. We use our findings to evaluate a number of mechanisms previously proposed in the ecological literature as resolutions of the drift paradox. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We combined temporal, individual and coalescent-based analyses of microsatellite DNA variation to explore the general hypothesis that unequal effective population size (N-e), asymmetric gene flow (m) and nonrandom (sex-biased) individual dispersal had an important effect on spatiotemporal population structuring in lake-dwelling brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis). This integrative examination shed light on the dichotomous structuring observed between an outlet and three tributary-spawning populations and their potential for adaptive divergence. It revealed further that finer tributary population structuring incongruent with drainage structure has been shaped by asymmetric m from one population with a large N-e towards two populations of smaller N-e. Gene flow among the tributaries was also mediated mainly by male-biased dispersal. However, longer distance dispersal from tributaries to the outflow was female-biased. Spatially dependent sex-biased dispersal may have contributed therefore to gene flow at different levels of population structuring. Our results demonstrate how dispersal and population structure may interrelate to produce spatial variation in intraspecific diversity, and are therefore relevant for conservation programmes seeking to define conservation units or predict recolonization rates of extirpated populations.},

	abstract = {The objective was to test the application of a novel, non-destructive photo-method estimating the larval encystment of one of the highly threatened unionid mussels, the freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) on the gills of its host fish, brown trout (Salmo trutta). There were significant correlations between the encystment intensity based on microscope counts and using the new photo-method for both young-of-the-year and older brown trout just after the encystment in October 2007 and just before larval release from the host fish in June 2008. The mean encystment intensity based on the two methods did not differ from each other for the two age classes of trout when based on comparisons including all individuals. An aquaria experiment showed that there were no differences in survival or growth between fish subjected to the treatments: photo-method and individual marking, photo-method and a control. When applied to encystment in single streams, there were significant correlations between the mean encystment intensity in each stream based on the methods for both trout age classes. Therefore, it may be possible to get reliable estimation of the encystment rates without injuring the mussel or the host fish, which may also be used in restoration and cultivation work. Furthermore, the larvae of M. margaritifera are among the smallest of all the worldwide-distributed, threatened unionid mussel species. The photo-method may therefore also be used for other mussel species with larger larvae, as they are more easily recognized on photos. Therefore, it may now be possible to investigate every life stage of unionid species without using harmful methods at all. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	volume = {153},
	abstract = {Long-term studies were carried out in central Finland between 1985 and 2003 to examine the temporal and spatial variation in the density of otter populations. Snow tracking was used to estimate the total population and the number of litters in the study area. In total 52 otters, including 16 cubs in 11 litters, lived in the study area (1,650 km(2)) in 2002-2003. The otter population clearly increased during the study period. The increase in density of the otter population was sigmoid, indicating that the population had reached the local carrying capacity. The density of the population was 0.12 individuals per river ha in 1985 and 0.29 individuals per river ha in 2002. The number of cubs per litter decreased when the density of the population increased. Density-dependent offspring production, together with the auto-correlation function of growth rate, indicates intraspecific competition in otter populations. Otters in a few river systems produced most of the cubs, creating several small source populations in the entire study area. Otters in secondary (sink) habitats had a low reproduction rate. Most otters lived in river systems with large lake surfaces. The number or area of lakes within the river system correlated positively with the total number of otters, litters and cubs in the river system. The six river systems (out of 16) with the largest water area of lakes produced 81.2\% of all cubs born in the study area. However, the population growth rate per river hectare or per river kilometre was equal in all kinds of river systems. Thus, among local otter populations in central Finland, a source-sink system between different habitats seems to be prevalent.},

This is especially so when the breeding areas are located upstream of a reservoir, and the floodplain is downstream of the dam. Therefore, the transport of fish larvae and eggs across reservoir barriers is a key factor in the development of effective conservation strategies. In this paper, we evaluate the potential for migratory fish larvae and egg transportation across a small size reservoir in eastern Brazil. We sampled fish daily between 15(th) October 2002 and 15(th) February 2003 (spawning period) in the Mucuri River, immediately upstream of the reservoir and downstream of the Santa Clara Power Plant dam. Our study was the first to indicate the possibility of successful larval passage through the reservoir of a hydroelectric reservoir and dam in South America, and showed that the passage of migratory fish larvae was associated significantly with residence time of water in the reservoir. The relatively short water residence time and elevated turbidity of the Santa Clara's reservoir waters during the rainy season certainly contributed to the successful passage, and can be considered as key factors for a priori evaluations of the feasibility of a downstream larval passage.},

	abstract = {Free embryos of wild pallid sturgeon Scaphirhynchus albus were released in the Missouri River and captured at downstream sites through a 180-km reach of the river to examine ontogenetic drift and dispersal processes. Free embryos drifted primarily in the fastest portion of the river channel, and initial drift velocities for all age groups (mean = 0.66-0.70 m s(-1)) were only slightly slower than mean water column velocity (0.72 m s(-1)). During the multi-day long-distance drift period, drift velocities of all age groups declined an average of 9.7\% day(-1). Younger free embryos remained in the drift upon termination of the study; whereas, older age groups transitioned from drifting to settling during the study. Models based on growth of free embryos, drift behavior, size-related variations in drift rates, and channel hydraulic characteristics were developed to estimate cumulative distance drifted during ontogenetic development through a range of simulated water temperatures and velocity conditions. Those models indicated that the average free embryo would be expected to drift several hundred km during ontogenetic development. Empirical data and model results highlight the long-duration, long-distance drift and dispersal processes for pallid sturgeon early life stages. In addition, results provide a likely mechanism for lack of pallid sturgeon recruitment in fragmented river reaches where dams and reservoirs reduce the length of free-flowing river available for pallid sturgeon free embryos during ontogenetic development.},

In this comparative study, we analysed the genetic structure of two freshwater trematode species with different life histories using cytochrome c oxidase I gene (COI) sequences and examined the effect of a unidirectional river current on their genetic diversity at 10 sites along the river. We found moderate genetic structure consistent with an isolation-by-distance pattern among subpopulations of Coitocaecum parvum but not in Stegodexamene anguillae. These contrasting parasite population structures were consistent with the relative dispersal abilities of their most mobile hosts (i.e. their definitive hosts). Genetic diversity decreased, as a likely consequence of unidirectional river flow, with increasing distance upstream in C. parvum, which utilizes a definitive host with only restricted mobility. The absence of such a pattern in S. anguillae suggests that unidirectional river flow affects parasite species differently depending on the dispersal abilities of their most mobile host. In conclusion, genetic structure, genetic diversity loss and drift are stronger in parasites whose most mobile hosts have low dispersal abilities and small home ranges. An additional prediction can be made for parasites under unidirectional drift: those parasites that stay longer in their benthic intermediate host or have more than one benthic intermediate hosts would have relatively high local recruitment and hence increased retention of upstream genetic diversity.},

Thus large forest fragments potentially provide excess individuals to neighboring small fragments where productivity is much lower and not adequate for replacement (sinks). We used occurrence data and distances between putative sources and sinks for four species of forest birds with this pattern of demography in large and small forest fragments to predict occupancy in small fragments. For the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Veery (Catharus fuscescens), and Rose-breasted Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludovicianus), distance from large woodlots was a significant predictor of occurrence in small woodlots. Distance from large woodlots did not predict occupancy of Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus), a species with no apparent difference in productivity in relation to fragment size. Neither vegetation features nor area of the small woodlots adequately explained patterns of occupancy for any species. These results suggest that maintenance of large, productive forest fragments benefit regional occurrence of forest-breeding birds by providing individuals to neighboring small woodlots. Limited reproduction in these small woodlots means that they may act as a reservoir for excess individuals in the case of catastrophic events that result in vacancies in source woodlots. Conservation and sound forest management of small forests should be directed particularly toward those closer to large regional forests.},

We describe an instability driven by directional dispersal in a spatially explicit consumerproducer model where spatial patterns emerge in the absence of external environmental variation. Dispersal of the consumer has both undirected and directed components that are functions of producer biomass. We demonstrate that directional dispersal is required for the instability, while undirected diffusive dispersal sets a lower bound to the spatial scale of emerging patterns. Furthermore, instability requires indirect feedbacks affecting consumer per capita dispersal rates, and not activatorinhibitor dynamics affecting production and mortality as is described in previous theory. This novel and less-restrictive mechanism for generating spatial patterns can arise over realistic parameter values, which we explore using an empirically inspired model and data on stream macroinvertebrates.},

In stream fish communities, local species richness (alpha diversity) and species turnover (beta diversity) are thought to be regulated by high extinction rates in headwater streams and high colonization rates in downstream areas. We evaluated the spatiotemporal structure of fish communities in streams originally surveyed by Burton and Odum 1945 (Ecology 26: 182194) in Virginia, USA and explored the effects of species traits on extinction and colonization dynamics. We documented dramatic changes in fish community structure at both the site and stream scales. Of the 34 fish species observed, 20 (59\%) were present in both time periods, but 11 (32\%) colonized the study area and three (9\%) were extirpated over time. Within streams, alpha diversity increased in two of three streams but beta diversity decreased dramatically in all streams due to fish community homogenization caused by colonization of common species and extirpation of rare species. Among streams, however, fish communities differentiated over time. Regression trees indicated that reproductive life-history traits such as spawning mound construction, associations with mound-building species, and high fecundity were important predictors of species persistence or colonization. Conversely, native fishes not associated with mound-building exhibited the highest rates of extirpation from streams. Our results demonstrate that stream fish colonization and extinction dynamics exhibit hierarchical spatial structure and suggest that mound-building fishes serve as keystone species for colonization of headwater streams.},

We explored spatial patterns of stream fish dispersal by evaluating how the size and proximity of connected streams (i.e., stream network topology) explained variation in fish assemblage structure and how this relationship varied with local stream size. We used data from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program in wadeable streams of the Mid-Atlantic Highlands region (n = 308 sites). We quantified stream network topology with a continuous analysis based on the rate of downstream flow accumulation from sites and with a discrete analysis based on the presence of mainstem river confluences (i.e., basin area {\textgreater}250 km(2)) within 20 fluvial km (flan) from sites. Continuous variation in stream network topology was related to local species richness within a distance of similar to 10 fkm, suggesting an influence of fish dispersal within this spatial grain. This effect was explained largely by catostomid species, cyprinid species, and riverine species, but was not explained by zoogeographic regions, ecoregions, sampling period, or spatial autocorrelation. Sites near mainstem river confluences supported greater species richness and abundance of catostomid, cyprinid, and ictalurid fishes than did sites {\textgreater}20 fkm from such confluences. Assemblages at sites on the smallest streams were not related to stream network topology, consistent with the hypothesis that local stream size regulates the influence of regional dispersal. These results demonstrate that the size and proximity of connected streams influence the spatial distribution of fish and suggest that these influences can be incorporated into the designs of stream bioassessments and reserves to enhance management efficacy.},

We argue that other types of connectivity/distance matrices will better represent dispersal paths, such as the watercourse distance for aquatic organisms (e.g. fish, shrimps). 2.

	volume = {16},
	abstract = {Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in the Illinois River are likely to function as a metapopulation (a system of local populations connected by dispersal). River currents reduce or eliminate internal recruitment by local populations, making them dependent upon external recruitment from propagules (larvae) produced by upriver populations. Because of the importance of external recruitment, understanding the population dynamics of riverine zebra mussels requires knowledge of larval flux. In 1994 and 1995, larval drift past a fixed site on the Illinois River was characterized by pulses of similar-sized individuals. These pulses were composed primarily of D-stage (straight hinge) larvae, not yet competent to settle. The continual passage of pulses of young larvae suggests that the upriver source population(s) spawned in frequent distinct bursts throughout the summer months rather than spawning only once or twice. Overall larval abundance was a poor predictor of availability of competent larvae. Although larvae were frequently present in high numbers, larvae {\textgreater}200 mu m in shell height (competent to settle) were present only sporadically at our fixed study site from May to November in 1994, and present only from June to early July in 1995. Settlement at a given site on the Illinois River is likely to be sporadic rather than constant. Colonization and population growth at a given site will occur only if suitable habitat and environmental conditions are available during the windows when competent larvae are available. Changes in mean size as a larval cohort drifted downriver suggested a growth rate of 6.72 mu m/d. At this growth rate, most larvae probably travel a minimum of 304.6 km (190.4 miles) before settling. Thus, larvae spawned in the main channel of the lower 70\% of the Illinois River are most likely to settle in the Mississippi River. We suggest that colonization and population growth in the upper 70\% of the Illinois River are strongly dependent upon larvae produced at upriver source sites in Lake Michigan and the Chicago area waterways. Control of zebra mussels in a given stretch of the river will depend upon control of the upriver source populations.},

Here, we argue that the same large-scale structures that have been purported to convey stability to food webs can also help to understand both the distribution of species diversity in nature and the relationship between species diversity and food web stability. Specifically, the allocation of species diversity to slow energy channels within food webs results in the skewed distribution of interactions strengths that has been shown to confer stability to complex food webs.

	volume = {21},
	abstract = {Spatial and temporal landscape patterns have long been recognized to influence biological processes, but these processes often operate at scales that are difficult to study by conventional means. Inferences from genetic markers can overcome some of these limitations. We used a landscape genetics approach to test hypotheses concerning landscape processes influencing the demography of Lahontan cutthroat trout in a complex stream network in the Great Basin desert of the western US. Predictions were tested with population- and individual-based analyses of microsatellite DNA variation, reflecting patterns of dispersal, population stability, and local effective population sizes. Complementary genetic inferences suggested samples from migratory corridors housed a mixture of fish from tributaries, as predicted based on assumed migratory life histories in those habitats. Also as predicted, populations presumed to have greater proportions of migratory fish or from physically connected, large, or high quality habitats had higher genetic variability and reduced genetic differentiation from other populations. Populations thought to contain largely non-migratory individuals generally showed the opposite pattern, suggesting behavioral isolation. Estimated effective sizes were small, and we identified significant and severe genetic bottlenecks in several populations that were isolated, recently founded, or that inhabit streams that desiccate frequently. Overall, this work suggested that Lahontan cutthroat trout populations in stream networks are affected by a combination of landscape and metapopulation processes. Results also demonstrated that genetic patterns can reveal unexpected processes, even within a system that is well studied from a conventional ecological perspective.},

	abstract = {Invasion by common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in shallow lakes have been followed by stable-state changes from a macrophyte-dominated clear water state to a phytoplankton-dominated turbid water state. Both invasive carp and crayfish are, therefore, possible drivers for catastrophic regime shifts. Despite these two species having been introduced into ecosystems world-wide, their relative significance on regime shifts remains largely unexplored. We compared the ecological impacts of carp and crayfish on submerged macrophytes, water quality, phytoplankton, nutrient dynamics, zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates by combining an enclosure experiment and a meta-analysis. The experiment was designed to examine how water quality and biological variables responded to increasing carp or crayfish biomass. We found that even at a low biomass, carp had large and positive impacts on suspended solids, phytoplankton and nutrients and negative impacts on benthic macroinvertebrates. In contrast, crayfish had a strong negative impact on submerged macrophytes. The impacts of crayfish on macrophytes were significantly greater than those of carp. The meta-analysis showed that both carp and crayfish have significant effects on submerged macrophytes, phytoplankton, nutrient dynamics and benthic macroinvertebrates, while zooplankton are affected by carp but not crayfish. It also indicated that crayfish have significantly greater impacts on macrophytes relative to carp. Overall, the meta-analysis largely supported the results of the experiment. Taken as a whole, our results show that both carp and crayfish have profound effects on community composition and ecosystem processes through combined consequences of bioturbation, excretion, consumption and non-consumptive destruction. However, key variables (e. g. macrophytes) relating to stable-state changes responded differently to increasing carp or crayfish biomass, indicating that they have differential ecosystem impacts.},

In western Queensland, fluctuations in sub-population size are likely to lead to local bottlenecks and extinctions, increasing the need for connectivity and gene flow to maintain population viability. 2. Using microsatellite markers, we explored evidence for this metapopulation structure in two species of freshwater fish (Maquaria ambigua and Tandanus tandanus) and one crustacean (Macrobrachium australiense) in a sub-catchment of the upper Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. 3. Overall, we found very weak genetic structure for all three species. Two species (M. ambigua and M. australiense) showed some significant genetic structure that did not correlate with geographic distance. However, decomposed pairwise regression analysis revealed evidence for intense genetic drift at the waterhole scale, suggesting that local bottlenecks are driving what little genetic structure does exist for these species. 4. The results identify the local impact of bottlenecks on genetic diversity, but highlight the importance of gene flow in maintaining population viability in these highly variable systems. As the impacts of bottlenecks are likely to be tempered by gene flow, it is suggested that the maintenance of connectivity is of paramount importance in this dryland system.},

Our data showed that postspawning movements of Bonneville cutthroat trout formed a continuum, with fish moving from 0.5 to 82.0 km. Postspawning distance was positively related to fish length. Despite the wide range of movement observed during the spring, fish did not move more than 0.5 km during the summer. A road culvert and an irrigation diversion dam did not seem to pose barriers to the upstream movement of Bonneville cutthroat trout to headwater spawning areas in the spring. However, 23\% of radio-tagged fish in 2000 moved into the irrigation diversion ditch as they moved downstream after spawning and subsequently died there. Maintaining drainage connectivity is an important conservation concern for trout populations such as this one, where fish move between complementary spawning and summer habitats.},

	abstract = {P{\textgreater} Invasive predators negatively affect native prey to varying degrees across landscapes, and spatial configuration of invader-free refugia may affect prey distributions across invaded river networks. In New Zealand, introduced trout (Salmo trutta and Oncorhynchus mykiss) create source-sink dynamics in native Galaxias vulgaris populations, and their co-occurrence with trout may be enhanced by immigration from trout-free reaches. We investigated how network configuration of trout-free demographic sources affected the distribution of G. vulgaris across trout-invaded riverscapes. Using quantitative biomass surveys and spatially extensive presence-absence surveys, the interaction between habitat variability and location relative to sources in limiting distributions of G. vulgaris in trout-invaded reaches was assessed. Galaxias vulgaris biomass at invaded sink sites decreased with increasing network distance to the nearest trout barrier. The maximum distance to barriers at which G. vulgaris occurred in the riverscape was limited, so that galaxiids were excluded from small and stable streams far from sources. Large predatory trout (i.e. {\textgreater} 150 mm fork length) occurred in high densities at stable sites all year round and were seasonally excluded from sites disturbed by flooding. Large streams probably provide increased refugia for galaxiids to avoid predation from trout, but narrowness and habitat stability may act synergistically to extirpate G. vulgaris from sites that are too far from sources to receive regular immigrants. The interaction between immigration and habitat configuration in mediating effects of trout on G. vulgaris distributions indicates the spatial dependency of predator-prey interactions in river networks. These results indicate creating new invader-free source habitat should enhance co-occurrence in nearby invader-occupied reaches. Moreover, adding source habitat in sink streams far from existing sources, and ensuring barriers prevent future invasion, will also allow native fish dispersal between sources and sinks and will maximise the conservation gains from management across invaded riverscapes.},

A small number of isotopically enriched adult stoneflies were captured in samples taken at adjacent streams between 800 m and 1.1 km away from the source population, including a headwater of a different river system. 4.

As predicted, large wetlands had lower rates of extirpation than small wetlands. There was a negative but statistically nonsignificant correlation between recolonization rate and distance to the nearest northerly source population. Populations at small sites were sensitive to drought, presumably because droughts can eliminate suitable habitat at small wetlands. Populations in small wetlands have declined over time, even after accounting for variation in stream flow, supporting the species' endangered status. Our study emphasizes the need to understand metapopulation dynamics for conserving species where the unit of conservation is a local population. It is also emphasizes the importance of not treating metapopulations as identical units.

	volume = {14},
	abstract = {Populations in agricultural landscapes often occur in source-sink situations: small patches of marginal habitat (sinks) are supported by an immigration flux from larger patches of high-quality habitat (sources). We sought to demonstrate that this situation occurs for Reed Warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) in a riverine, mainly agricultural landscape in the Netherlands. We collected data on occurrence and habitat features in a large number of mostly small marshlands. We used a stochastic model to simulate the population dynamics in a metapopulation with sinks and sources. A statistical analysis of the field data, using regression techniques with occupation probability and abundance index as dependent variables, showed that habitat quality was less favourable in small habitat patches (e.g., ditches with reeds) than in larger patches (large, heterogeneous marshlands). The spatial cohesion of the landscape also played an important role: abundance of breeding Reed Warblers in regions with low spatial cohesion was low. Local extinctions and recolonizations occurred and their rates depended on the spatial parameters of the patch. This supports the hypothesis that metapopulation theory is applicable here. The results of the modeling study demonstrated that, besides the trivial dependence of sinks on sources, a larger amount of sink area and increased exchange of individuals increased the stability of source patches. This was shown not only by the larger size of the source population but also by increased resilience after a catastrophe. The area of the sink seemed less important than its distance to the source. The simulation indicated an optimal area of a few hectares (compared to a 10-ha area of the source) and a maximum distance of 2-5 km from the source. In creating sustainable landscapes, for example, by setting up an ecological network consisting of a limited number of high-quality patches, these small and seemingly insignificant habitat patches could play an important role and should be taken into consideration.},

	abstract = {The mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa) was once a common inhabitant of the Sierra Nevada (California, USA), but has declined precipitously during the past century due in part to the introduction of normative fish into naturally fishless habitats. The objectives of the current study were to describe (1) the effect of fish removal from three lakes (located in two watersheds) on the small, remnant R. muscosa populations inhabiting those lakes, and (2) the initial development of metapopulation structure in each watershed as R. muscosa from expanding populations in fish-removal lakes dispersed to adjacent habitats. At all three fish-removal lakes, R. muscosa population densities increased significantly following the removal of predatory fish. The magnitude of these increases was significantly greater than that observed over the same time period in R. muscosa populations inhabiting control lakes that remained in their natural fishless condition. Following these population increases, R. muscosa dispersed to adjacent suitable (but unoccupied) sites, moving between 200 and 900 In along streams or across dry land. Together, these results suggest that largescale removal of introduced fish could result in at least partial reversal of the decline of R. muscosa. Continued monitoring of R. muscosa at the fish-removal sites will be necessary to determine whether the positive effects of fish eradication are sustained over the long-term, especially in light of the increasingly important role played by an emerging infectious disease (chytridiomycosis, caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) in influencing R. muscosa populations.

It considers the ecological consequences of where things are located in space, where they are relative to other things, and how these relationships and their consequences are contingent on the characteristics of the surrounding landscape mosaic at multiple scales in time and space. Traditionally, landscape ecologists have focused their attention on terrestrial ecosystems, and rivers and streams have been considered either as elements of landscape mosaics or as units that are linked to the terrestrial landscape by flows across boundaries or ecotones. Less often, the heterogeneity that exists within a river or stream has been viewed as a 'riverscape' in its own right. 2. Landscape ecology can be unified about six central themes: (1) patches differ in quality (2) patch boundaries affect flows, (3) patch context matters, (4) connectivity is critical, (5) organisms are important, and (6) the importance of scale. Although riverine systems differ from terrestrial systems by virtue of the strong physical force of hydrology and the inherent connectivity provided by water flow, all of these themes apply equally to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and to the linkages between the two. 3. Landscape ecology therefore has important insights to offer to the study of riverine ecosystems, but these systems may also provide excellent opportunities for developing and testing landscape ecological theory. The principles and approaches of landscape ecology should be extended to include freshwater systems; it is time to take the 'land' out of landscape ecology.},

First, recent studies show that hydraulics can be used successfully to delineate patches of mussel habitat, but additional variables such as host fish, food, or predators are probably important under certain conditions. However, research on patch dynamics in freshwater mussels is in its infancy, and we do not know if existing methods to delineate patches are adequate. Second, mussel ecologists are starting to think about the importance of connectivity among habitat patches. Major challenges will be to determine whether connectivity can be estimated in the field and whether human activities that reduce connectivity (e.g., dams) have produced large extinction debts in mussel populations. Third, we need to better understand the links between events on the watershed (e.g., timing and amounts of water, nutrient, and sediment inputs) and the quality, extent, location, and connections among patches of mussel habitats. Because of its focus on patterns and processes, landscape ecology has the potential to improve scientific understanding and management of mussel populations and, in particular, to help define the best spatial scales for scientific studies and management activities.},

One commonly applied approach to visualize these is the analysis of occupancy-frequency patterns. We used data sets describing stream insect distributions from different regions of North America to analyze occupancy-frequency patterns and assess the effects of spatial scale, sampling intensity, and taxonomic resolution on these patterns. Distributions were dominated by satellite taxa (those occurring in {\textless}= 10\% of sites), whereas the occurrence of core taxa (occurring in {\textgreater}= 90\% of sites) determined the overall modality of occupancy-frequency patterns. The proportions of satellite taxa increased with spatial scale and showed positive relationships with sampling intensity (r(2)=0.74-0.96). Furthermore, analyses of data sets from New York (USA) showed that generic-level assessments underestimated the satellite class and occasionally shifted occupancy-frequency distributions from unimodal to bimodal. Our results indicate that, regardless of species- or generic-level taxonomy, stream insect communities are characterized by satellite species and that the proportion of satellite species increases with spatial scale and sampling intensity. Thus, niche-based models of occupancy-frequency patterns better characterize stream insect communities than metapopulation models such as the core-satellite species hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Metapopulation structure of species in fragmented landscapes is ultimately the result of spatial variability in demographic processes. While specific information on demographic parameters is desirable, a more practical approach to studying metapopulations in fragmented landscapes may begin with analyses of species' occurrence in relation to large-scale habitat variability. Here, we analyzed occurrence of stream-living bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) in relation to physical, biotic, and geometrical characteristics of habitats. Bull trout occurrence was analyzed at several spatial (10(chi) m) scales. Data were from nested sampling of 720 sites (10 m), 179 reaches (10(2) m), and 81 patches (greater than or equal to 10(3) m) of stream habitats within the Boise River basin of central Idaho. Based on previous findings, patches were defined as stream catchments with suitable conditions for spawning and rearing of bull trout ({\textgreater}1600 m elevation). Patch-scale bull trout occurrence was significantly related to patch area and isolation (stream distance between occupied patches). Lack of spatial autocorrelation between patches indicated that isolation effects were more likely the result of limited interaction among habitats (such as dispersal), rather than of correlated environmental conditions. A third factor, human disturbance in the form of roads, was associated with reduced bull trout occurrence at the patch-scale. Analyses of occurrence among reaches within occupied patches showed bull trout may select larger ({\textgreater}2 m width) stream habitats. Occurrence of bull trout was not associated with nonnative brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) at large (patch), intermediate (reach), or small (site) spatial scales. Definition of a metapopulation structure for bull trout in the Boise River basin was complicated by uncertainties in the frequency and magnitude of dispersal. From the distribution of patch sizes and isolation among occupied patches, we suggest that the metapopulation is a complex mosaic of several elements found in conceptual models. This complexity poses a challenge to empirical and theoretical attempts to study stream-living bull trout. Future work to define the structure of bull trout metapopulations must relate temporal and spatial patterns of patch occupancy with complex patterns of dispersal that likely interact with habitat spatial structure, life history variability, and the historical context of regional climate changes. Results of this work suggest that conservation of bull trout should involve protection of larger, less isolated, and less disturbed (as indexed by road densities) habitats that may serve as important refugia or sources of recolonization. Bull trout populations in smaller, isolated, and more disturbed habitats may be at risk of extinction. Finally, metapopulation structure implies the existence of suitable, but presently unoccupied habitat, which should be managed carefully to facilitate potential natural recolonization or reintroductions of bull trout.},

	volume = {143},
	abstract = {Metapopulation theory is one of the most popular approaches to identify the factors affecting the spatial and temporal dynamics of populations in fragmented habitat networks. Habitat quality, patch area and isolation are mainly focused on when analyzing distribution patterns in fragmented landscapes. The effects of landscape heterogeneity in the non-occupied matrix, however, have been largely neglected. Here, we determined the relative importance of patch quality and landscape attributes on the occurrence, density and extinction of the Dupont's lark (Chersophilus duponti), an endangered steppe passerine whose habitat has been extremely reduced to highly isolated and fragmented patches embedded in a mainly unsuitable landscape matrix. Habitat patch quality, measured in terms of vegetation structure, grazing pressure, arthropod availability, predator abundance, and inter-specific competition, did not affect occurrence, density or extinction. At the landscape scale, however, the species' occurrence was principally determined by the interactions among patch size, geographic isolation and landscape matrix. Isolation had the main independent contribution to explaining the probability of occurrence, followed by landscape matrix composition and patch size. The species' density was negatively correlated to patch size, suggesting crowding effects in small fragments, while extinction events were exclusively related to isolation. Our findings suggest that landscape rather than local population characteristics are crucial in determining the patterns of distribution and abundance of non-equilibrium populations in highly fragmented habitat networks. Consequently, conservation measures for these species should simultaneously involve patch size, isolation and landscape matrix and apply to the entire metapopulation rather than to particular patches.

They are extremely important for the conservation of the species in the south of its European distribution, but are also threatened, especially in rivers Mente and Rabacal affected by two dams to be constructed in the very near future. The conservation of the mussel in Portugal depends on extensive surveys of their actual populations and efforts for protecting them. If this is achieved, Portuguese and Spanish populations of M. margaritifera together could be a stronghold for the conservation of the species in Europe. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {1. We investigated the occurrence (presence or absence) of stream-dwelling Dolly Varden (Salmonidae: Salvelinus malma) in the 78 tributaries of the Sorachi River system, Hokkaido, Japan to examine evidence for metapopulation structure. 2. We hypothesised (i) that the occurrence of Dolly Varden would be less likely in small tributaries because of the higher extinction risk and (ii) that occurrence would be less likely in isolated tributaries because of reduced rates of dispersal and colonisation. In addition to these two general predictions, we hypothesised (iii) that the occurrence would be more likely in spring-fed tributaries, because Dolly Varden prefer cold water as present in these systems. 3. When all the tributaries were included in a multiple logistic regression analysis, habitat size and habitat type (spring-fed versus non-spring-fed tributaries) were selected for the best model, whereas isolation was not important. However, when tributaries in the lower Sorachi basin (an area likely influenced by human activities) were excluded from the analysis, the effect of isolation became significant. 4. Our results indicate there is a potential metapopulation structure of the Dolly Varden in the Sorachi River basin. Furthermore, it is possible that metapopulation dynamics follow a clinal pattern. In the upper and middle reaches of the Sorachi River basin, an equilibrium between extinction and colonisation of Dolly Varden populations is a possibility. In the lower portion of the basin, isolation appeared to be less important, and extinction rate may be driving patterns of occurrence toward systematic extinction of local populations. 5. Our results illustrate the possibility of spatial variation in the processes influencing occurrence of Dolly Varden within a single river basin, and the potential influences of habitat alteration on extinction and colonisation processes.},

	abstract = {Declines in many native fish populations have led to reassessments of management goals and shifted priorities from consumptive uses to species preservation. As management has shifted, relevant environmental characteristics have evolved from traditional metrics that described local habitat quality to characterizations of habitat size and connectivity. Despite the implications this shift has for how habitats may be prioritized for conservation, it has been rare to assess the relative importance of these habitat components. We used an information - theoretic approach to select the best models from sets of logistic regressions that linked habitat quality, size, and connectivity to the occurrence of chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) nests. Spawning distributions were censused annually from 1995 to 2004, and data were complemented with field measurements that described habitat quality in 43 suitable spawning patches across a stream network that drained 1150 km(2) in central Idaho. Results indicated that the most plausible models were dominated by measures of habitat size and connectivity, whereas habitat quality was of minor importance. Connectivity was the strongest predictor of nest occurrence, but connectivity interacted with habitat size, which became relatively more important when populations were reduced. Comparison of observed nest distributions to null model predictions confirmed that the habitat size association was driven by a biological mechanism when populations were small, but this association may have been an area- related sampling artifact at higher abundances. The implications for habitat management are that the size and connectivity of existing habitat networks should be maintained whenever possible. In situations where habitat restoration is occurring, expansion of existing areas or creation of new habitats in key areas that increase connectivity may be beneficial. Information about habitat size and connectivity also could be used to strategically prioritize areas for improvement of local habitat quality, with areas not meeting minimum thresholds being deemed inappropriate for pursuit of restoration activities.},

	abstract = {Introduced predators with patchy distributions can create demographic sinks within native prey populations. Such invasions may give rise to source-sink metapopulations if there are still sources of native species colonists in the landscape. In New Zealand, introduced brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhychus mykiss) are linked with declines in native non-diadromous galaxiids but co-occur with these galaxiids in some locations. We investigated whether trout create sinks in Galaxias vulgaris populations, and whether trout-free reaches could act as sources, allowing persistence in the sink habitat. We conducted quantitative seasonal monitoring of G. vulgaris population structure across two subcatchments of the Waimakariri River, South Island. Two trout-free and seven trout-invaded sites in the Porter River catchment and two trout-free and five trout-invaded sites in the Broken River catchment were monitored over two winters and the adjoining summer. Spatially continuous monitoring of young-of-the-year (YOY) galaxiid distributions and apparent survival across the Broken River catchment was also undertaken. Galaxias vulgaris YOY recruitment was high in trout-free reaches, indicating positive population growth. Galaxias vulgaris was absent from three trout-invaded sites, and the remaining invaded sites had significantly depleted juvenile recruitment. Information-theoretic model selection indicated that trout, rather than habitat, drove recruitment failure. Trout-invaded sites could be divided into "sinks'' that retained no YOY galaxiids, indicating no local recruitment, and "pseudosinks,'' which had very few recruits. Absence of small G. vulgaris at sink sites suggested population maintenance through immigration of adults from sources, whereas pseudosink sites appear capable of self-recruitment at low carrying capacities. Trout-free reaches appear to act as sources in a river network but are susceptible to future invasions by trout. Thus, not only may invasive species cause source -sink metapopulations in native species, but also the potential of refugia for natives (sources) to become future sinks highlights the vulnerability of these metapopulations when invasive predators are the principal demographic driver.},

	volume = {144},
	abstract = {The development and implementation of a population supplementation and restoration plan for any endangered species should involve an understanding of the species' habitat requirements prior to the release of any captive bred individuals. The freshwater pearl mussel, Margaritifera margaritifera, has undergone dramatic declines over the last century and is now globally endangered. In Northern Ireland, the release of captive bred individuals is being used to support wild populations and repatriate the species in areas where it once existed. We employed a combination of maximum entropy modelling (MAXENT) and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) to identify ecological parameters necessary to support wild populations using GIS-based landscape scale and ground-truthed habitat scale environmental parameters. The GIS-based landscape scale model suggested that mussel occurrence was associated with altitude and soil characteristics including the carbon, clay, sand, and silt content. Notably, mussels were associated with a relatively narrow band of variance indicating that M. margaritifera has a highly specific landscape niche. The ground-truthed habitat scale model suggested that mussel occurrence was associated with stable consolidated substrates, the extent of bankside trees, presence of indicative macrophyte species and fast flowing water. We propose a three phase conservation strategy for M. margaritifera identifying suitable areas within rivers that (i) have a high conservation value yet needing habitat restoration at a local level, (ii) sites for population supplementation of existing populations and (iii) sites for species reintroduction to rivers where the mussel historically occurred but is now locally extinct. A combined analytical approach including GIS-based landscape scale and ground-truthed habitat scale models provides a robust method by which suitable release sites can be identified for the population supplementation and restoration of an endangered species. Our results will be highly influential in the future management of M. margaritifera in Northern Ireland. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	volume = {19},
	abstract = {Caughley (1994) argued that researchers working on threatened populations tended to follow the "small population paradigm" or the "declining population paradigm," and that greater integration of these paradigms was needed. Here I suggest that two related paradigms exist at the broader spatial scale, namely the metapopulation paradigm and habitat paradigm, and that these two paradigms also need to be integrated if we are to provide sound management advice. This integration is not trivial, and I outline five problems that need to be addressed: (1) habitat variables may not measure habitat quality, so site-specific data on vital rates are needed to resolve the effects of habitat quality and metapopulation dynamics; (2) measurements of vital rates may be confounded by movements, (3) vital rates may be density dependent, (4) vital rates may be affected by genotype; and (5) vital rates cannot be measured in unoccupied patches. I reviewed papers published in Conservation Biology from 1994 to 2003 and found 41 studies that analyzed data from 10 or more sites to understand the factors limiting species' distributions. Five of the analyses presented were purely within the metapopulation paradigm, 14 were purely within the habitat paradigm, 17 involved elements of both paradigms, and 7 were theoretically ambiguous (2 papers presented 2 distinct analyses and were counted twice). This suggests that many researchers appreciate the need to integrate the paradigms. Only one study, however, used data on vital rates to resolve the effects of habitat quality and metapopulation dynamics (problem 1), and this study did not address problems 2-5. I conclude that more intensive research incorporating site-specific data on vital rates and movement is needed to complement the numerous analyses of distributional data being produced.},

	volume = {84},
	abstract = {Dispersal among spatially subdivided populations and variability in local habitat patch quality can strongly affect local and regional population dynamics. A meta-population of mayflies (Callibaetis ferrugineus hageni) was studied in which larvae developed in beaver ponds and emerged to the terrestrial habitat as adults; adult females had the potential to disperse among ponds before oviposition. Ponds (patches) differed in the presence or absence of trout. Densities of late instar larvae were more than an order of magnitude greater in fishless ponds. Estimates of adult production, migration, and oviposition rate were used to determine whether the difference in larval abundance between pond types was more consistent with a source-sink or balanced dispersal model. Patch quality among ponds (estimated by the emergence rate of adults) varied from 0 to similar to3900 individuals.m(-2).yr(-1), and was significantly lower in ponds with trout. Survivorship of adult females in the regional terrestrial habitat was low (1.7\%). Consistent with the predictions of source-sink theory, local recruitment to the next generation was not related to local emergence. Moreover, comparison of emergence and recruitment revealed that some ponds were net exporters of females (sources) and others were net importers (sinks). Ovipositing females did not avoid ovipositing in ponds with trout. Overall, the data were consistent with a source-sink dynamic because patches differed in quality, and because there was net migration of individuals from sources to sinks. The results support the hypothesis that local and regional population dynamics are influenced by spatial variation in patch quality, and by the ability of individuals to both disperse among and assess the quality of habitat patches.},

	abstract = {1. The influence of spatial structure on population dynamics within river-stream networks is poorly understood. Utilizing spatially explicit analyses of temporal genetic variance, we tested whether persistence of central stonerollers (Campostoma anomalum) reflects differences in habitat quality and location within a highly modified urban catchment in southwestern Ohio, U.S.A. 2. Estimates of genetic diversity did not vary with habitat quality. Nevertheless, evidence of weak but temporally stable genetic structure, location-dependent effective population sizes and rates of immigration among sites, together suggest that persistence of central stonerollers within the catchment may be attributable to source-sink dynamics driven by habitat heterogeneity. 3. Under this scenario, migrant-pool colonization from areas of relatively high habitat quality in the upper catchment sustains the presence of central stonerollers at degraded sites in the main stem and dampens population subdivision within the catchment. However, because intact habitat is restricted to the upper portion of the catchment, it is not possible to preclude net downstream dispersal as a mechanism contributing to source-sink dynamics. The slight genetic structure that persists appears to reflect weak isolation by distance diminished by high rates of immigration. 4. This study suggests that without a systems perspective of the conditions that sustain populations in degraded waterways, environmental assessments may underestimate levels of impairment. Conservation and management of stream fishes could be improved by maintaining habitat in areas that are net exporters of migrants or by remediation of impaired habitat.},

	abstract = {We describe a spatially realistic metapopulation model and parameterize it for a metapopulation of the butterfly Melitaea cinxia, residing in a network of 50 discrete habitat patches within an area of 15 km2. Parameter values that are difficult to estimate independently are obtained by fitting the model to patterns of patch occupancy and local density. There is no large ''mainland'' population, and the metapopulation appears to survive at an extinction-colonization equilibrium. Empty patches were smaller than the occupied ones, indicating the extinction proneness of especially small local populations; population turnover was 16\% between 2 yr. Density in the occupied patches increased with decreasing isolation and with decreasing patch area, suggesting that migration plays an important role in local dynamics. Mark-recapture results confirmed that migration between local populations was common, in contrast to what is frequently assumed for butterflies with well-defined local populations in discrete habitat patches. The modelling results demonstrate that it is possible to have empty habitat patches in a metapopulation in spite of frequent migration, as we observed for M. cinxia. Colonization rate of empty patches may be low for several reasons, including difficulties in mate location at low density (not likely to be important here), conspecific attraction (possibly important), stepping-stone and other forms of nonrandom migration (likely to be important), and weak density dependence (likely to be important). Our results support the assumptions of structured metapopulation models, which demonstrate the possibility of alternative stable equilibria for metapopulations in which migration significantly affects local dynamics.},

Theory predicts reduced dispersal propensity in small and isolated habitat patches. We tested these predictions in the waterstrider Aquarius najas, a wingless species with special habitat demands. Flightlessness constrains insect dispersal and as a stream specialist A. najas cannot survive on still water. Lakes therefore represent a dispersal barrier for this species. We measured dispersal propensity of the waterstrider A. najas which originated from ten fragmented populations. In the experiment, we transplanted laboratory-grown individuals to the field. We did not find differences between sex in dispersal propensity. However, we found that waterstriders that originated from small and isolated patches moved less than individuals from large and more continuous habitats. This suggests that the cost of dispersal over hostile surrounding habitats may be high. We conclude that a low likelihood of dispersal in A. najas is an adaptation to small and isolated stream habitats.},

However, annual probabilities of colonization and extinction were usually not correlated with the fraction of sites occupied, a key prediction of many Levins-style metapopulation models. Instead, these probabilities were related to position in the stream gradient. For most species, colonization was less likely and extinction more likely in upstream than downstream sites. Consequently, the simple Levins-style metapopulation models failed to accurately predict the dynamics of most species.

To successfully manage populations in regions with anthropogenic disturbances and habitat fragmentation, an understanding of important processes at each of these spatial scales is important. We used a model selection approach to identify an effective spatial scale to manage the Idaho Giant Salamander, Dicamptodon aterrimus. We used data from field surveys to compare support for local and landscape-scale models that explain D. aterrimus occurrence and density in 40 streams distributed throughout the Lochsa River basin, Idaho. Local-scale models included covariates that reflect patch quality. Landscape-scale models included variables that reflect predictions from metapopulation theory about the importance of patch size, connectivity, and fragmentation. Our results suggest that landscape-scale processes are important controls on D. aterrimus occurrence and that this species has broad habitat requirements within streams. Specifically, we found that probability of D. aterrimus occurrence was highest in roadless drainages and lowest in spatially isolated streams and in drainages with high old-growth forest density. Surprisingly, we found that D. aterrimus density was greatest in streams with a high proportion of embedded substrate and fine sediment. The positive association with embedded substrate may reflect adaptation to a high frequency of natural disturbances, such as landslides, in our study area. We suggest that management and conservation efforts for this species focus on protecting roadless areas and restoring stream connectivity in human-impacted areas, rather than on only improving habitat quality within streams.},

It remains unclear, though, whether few(8) or many(9) of the species in an ecosystem are needed to sustain the provisioning of ecosystem services. It has been hypothesized that most species would promote ecosystem services if many times, places, functions and environmental changes were considered(9); however, no previous study has considered all of these factors together. Here we show that 84\% of the 147 grassland plant species studied in 17 biodiversity experiments promoted ecosystem functioning at least once. Different species promoted ecosystem functioning during different years, at different places, for different functions and under different environmental change scenarios. Furthermore, the species needed to provide one function during multiple years were not the same as those needed to provide multiple functions within one year. Our results indicate that even more species will be needed to maintain ecosystem functioning and services than previously suggested by studies that have either (1) considered only the number of species needed to promote one function under one set of environmental conditions, or (2) separately considered the importance of biodiversity for providing ecosystem functioning across multiple years(10-14), places(15,16), functions(14,17,18) or environmental change scenarios(12,19-22).

Ecological and life history traits of species living in streams, such as the potential for overland movement, may interact with this architecture to shape patterns of occupancy and response to disturbance. Specifically, large-scale habitat alteration that fragments stream networks and reduces connectivity may reduce the probability a stream is occupied by sensitive species, such as stream salamanders. 3. We collected habitat occupancy data on four species of stream salamanders in first-order (i.e. headwater) streams in undeveloped and urbanised regions of the eastern U.S.A. We then used an information-theoretic approach to test alternative models of salamander occupancy based on a priori predictions of the effects of network configuration, region and salamander life history. 4. Across all four species, we found that streams connected to other first-order streams had higher occupancy than those flowing directly into larger streams and rivers. For three of the four species, occupancy was lower in the urbanised region than in the undeveloped region. 5. These results demonstrate that the spatial configuration of stream networks within protected areas affects the occurrences of stream salamander species. We strongly encourage preservation of network connections between first-order streams in conservation planning and management decisions that may affect stream species.},

Cup-shaped nests were particularly vulnerable in fragments. We then examined over six breeding seasons and 14 study sites in a multivariable survival analysis the influence of landscape structure and nest location on daily nest survival for 13 common species representing 1,272 nests and four nest types (plate, cup, dome, and pouch). Across species and nest types, area, distance of nest to edge, and nest height had a dominant influence on daily nest survival, with area being positively related to nest survival and distance of nest to edge and nest height being both positively and negatively associated with daily nest survival. Our results indicate that multiple environmental factors contribute to reduce nest survival within a tropical understory bird community in a fragmented landscape and that maintaining large continuous forest is important for enhancing nest survival for Afrotropical understory birds.},

However, because data on the individual consequences of dispersal distance are extremely limited, we have little insight on how LDD is maintained in natural populations. I used six years of spatially explicit capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data to test the prediction that individual performance increases with dispersal distance in the stream salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus. Dispersal distance was total distance moved along the 1-km study stream, ranging from 0 to 565 m. To quantify individual performance, I used CMR estimates of survival and individual growth rates based on change in body length. Survival and growth rates increased significantly with dispersal distance. These relationships were not confounded by pre-dispersal body condition or by ecological gradients along the stream. Individual benefits of LDD were likely caused by an increase in the upper limit of settlement site quality with dispersal distance. My results do not support the view that the fitness consequences of LDD are unpredictable and instead suggest that consistent evolutionary mechanisms may explain the prevalence of LDD in nature. They also highlight the value of direct CMR data for understanding the individual consequences of variation in dispersal distance and how that variation is maintained in natural populations.},

	abstract = {Theory suggests that source-sink dynamics can allow coexistence of intraguild predators and prey, but empirical evidence for this coexistence mechanism is limited. We used capture-mark-recapture, genetic methods, and stable isotopes to test whether source-sink dynamics promote coexistence between stream fishes, the intraguild predator, and stream salamanders (Dicamptodon aterrimus), the intraguild prey. Salamander populations from upstream reaches without fish were predicted to maintain or supplement sink populations in downstream reaches with fish. We found instead that downstream reaches with fish were not sinks even though fish consumed salamander larvae-apparent survival, recruitment, and population growth rate did not differ between upstream and downstream reaches. There was also no difference between upstream and downstream reaches in net emigration. We did find that D. aterrimus moved frequently along streams, but believe that this is a response to seasonal habitat changes rather than intraguild predation. Our study provides empirical evidence that local-scale mechanisms are more important than dispersal dynamics to coexistence of streams salamanders and fish. More broadly, it shows the value of empirical data on dispersal and gene flow for distinguishing between local and spatial mechanisms of coexistence.},

	abstract = {1. The presence/absence of a species at a particular site is the simplest form of data that can be collected during ecological field studies. We used 13 years (1990-2002) of survey data to parameterize a stochastic patch occupancy model for a metapopulation of the yellow-bellied marmot in Colorado, and investigated the significance of particular patches and the influence of site quality, network characteristics and regional stochasticity on the metapopulation persistence. 2. Persistence of the yellow-bellied marmot metapopulation was strongly dependent on the high quality colony sites, and persistence probability was highly sensitive to small changes in the quality of these sites. 3. A relatively small number of colony sites was ultimately responsible for the regional persistence. However, lower quality satellite sites also made a significant contribution to long-term metapopulation persistence, especially when regional stochasticity was high. 4. The northern network of the marmot metapopulation was more stable compared to the southern network, and the persistence of the southern network depended heavily on the northern network. 5. Although complex models of metapopulation dynamics may provide a more accurate description of metapopulation dynamics, such models are data-intensive. Our study, one of the very few applications of stochastic patch occupancy models to a mammalian species, suggests that stochastic patch occupancy models can provide important insights into metapopulation dynamics using data that are easy to collect.},

Here we focus on two types of large-scale effects that may influence small-scale density: an additive effect that changes the density at patch level; and a non-additive effect that changes the relationship between the density and its limiting factor at the patch level. ANCOVA showed that patch-level density of this spider was positively correlated with web-site availability at this level, but the density with a given amount of web-site differed among populations (cedar forests), indicating the existence of an additive large-scale effect. Multiple regression analysis showed that web-site availability at a population level explained the additive large-scale effect well, but prey availability and forest size did not. It seemed likely that increased web-site availability may have reduced the mortality of spiders while moving to a new web-site, and hence increased population density. A non-additive large-scale effect was also revealed: i.e. the relationship between density and web-site availability at the patch level tended to be stronger in populations with a greater additive large-scale effect. Higher intraspecific competition for web-sites in these populations appeared to have strengthened this relationship.},

Recent spatially realistic metapopulation models have allowed patch dynamics to be investigated in natural populations but such models have rarely been applied to plants. Using a simple urban fragmented population system in which favourable habitat can be easily mapped, we studied patch dynamics in the annual plant Crepis sancta (Asteraceae). Using stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs) and multi-year occupancy data we dissected extinction and colonization patterns in our system. Overall, our data were consistent with two distinct metapopulation scenarios. A metapopulation (sensu stricto) dynamic in which colonization occurs over a short distance and extinction is lowered by nearby occupied patches (rescue effect) was found in a set of patches close to the city centre, while a propagule rain model in which colonization occurs from a large external population was most consistent with data from other networks. Overall, the study highlights the importance of external seed sources in urban patch dynamics. Our analysis emphasizes the fact that plant distributions are governed not only by habitat properties but also by the intrinsic properties of colonization and dispersal of species. The metapopulation approach provides a valuable tool for understanding how colonization and extinction shape occupancy patterns in highly fragmented plant populations. Finally, this study points to the potential utility of more complex plant metapopulation models than traditionally used for analysing ecological and evolutionary processes in natural metapopulations.},

Species removal and augmentation experiments, other manipulations, direct measurements, and path-analytic methods can determine the presence and intensity of mutualism within guilds.

	abstract = {Invertebrate diversity patterns were examined in 11 freshwater habitats (10 streams and a windswept lake shore) of similar physicochemical nature but different thermal and hydrologic stability in the Cass-Craigieburn region, New Zealand. Species richness and density were markedly higher at the more stable sites, but species evenness peaked at sites of intermediate stability. Of the 20 environmental variables examined, a multivariate instability index incorporating temporal variation in depth, temporal variation in current speed, substrate stability, the Pfankuch channel stability index, temperature range, and stream reach tractive force was the single best predictor of the number of species, whereas epilithic pigment concentration was the single best predictor of invertebrate density. The pattern in species richness did not support any of three diversity hypotheses considered. In contrast, the pattern in species evenness suggested competitive exclusion may be occurring patchily and that Huston's dynamic equilibrium model may have some validity, at least at the level of the patch. However, the strong link between productivity and stability apparent in these habitats, and a lack of information on the effects of increased productivity on competition in stream benthic communities makes any firm assessment of the latter model difficult. The observed diversity patterns are, however, consistent with the idea that high diversity is maintained in these habitats by an interaction between low levels of disturbance and habitat patchiness.},

	abstract = {Increasing emphasis is being placed on the large-scale and long-term dynamics of populations. A butterfly (Euphydryas editha) metapopulation that was naturally restricted to rocky outcrops in an area of coniferous forest suffered two major perturbations in 30 yr. First, humans clear-cut patches of forest in about 1967. The butterfly colonized the clear-cuts, in which it began to oviposit on a novel host plant, Collinsia torreyi. Breeding success was high, and the clear-cut habitat supported a population source; in the mid-1980s, there was net movement of adults from clear-cut to outcrop, and butterfly densities were elevated on outcrops close to population sources. The second major perturbation came in 1992, when a severe summer frost killed C. torreyi plants (outcrop hosts were not damaged). As a result, E. editha larvae starved in clear-cuts, and the source populations became extinct. This occurrence allowed us to test several predictions of source-sink theory. As predicted, densities declined on outcrops, and particularly on those close to former sources; by 1993, densities on outcrops were no longer correlated with isolation from former sources. True population sinks are predicted to become extinct in the absence of immigration, but this prediction was not observed. Outcrops were not true sinks because E. editha occupied this habitat before the creation of sources, survived the frost on outcrops, and persisted on outcrops in areas where they were isolated from sources. Outcrops were pseudosinks; breeding success was poor at immigration-enhanced densities, but outcrop populations did not rely on immigration to persist. The implications for conservation biology are that populations with high mean density and that act as sources are not necessarily more stable than lower-density or pseudosink populations. This may be especially true of systems subject to recent human disturbance, as in the present case.},

Further, A. geminipuncta could be considered a keystone species, since shoot damage facilitated more than twenty species of herbivores, saprovores (of the caterpillars' feces and their parasitoids. The gall midge Lasioptera arundinis could survive only in side shoots induced by shoot damage of A. geminipuncta. Small Phragmites stands bad thinner shoots (due to a water or nutrient deficiency) and shoots with more leaves (due to a better light supply) than large stands, thereby influencing species-specific demands for habitat suitability and nutritiousness of reed tissue. In other words significance of habitat fragmentation could not be assessed by, area alone. For example, two chloropid flies depending on thin, yellowish shoots survived only in small habitats or in the unmown edges of large habitats, Local persistence of Phragmites herbivores depended on much larger population sizes than could be expected from a population size sufficient to maintain genetic variation. At least 11,000 adults of the gall midge Giraudiella inclusa (or more than 84,000 galls) were necessary to avoid local extinction. With regard to conservation management of reed habitats, nature reserves should consist of old and unmown reeds, have fewer disturbed (particularly, fewer mown) habitat edges, measure more than two hectares (priority should go to the largest remaining fragments and be surrounded by nearby reed habitats providing reservoir populations and diverse shoot types.},

The model predicts well the observed minimum patch size for occupancy and the numbers of extinctions and colonizations per year (turnover rate).

The C:N ratio was lower for FPOM (6.9-15.6) than for MPOM (6.3-17.4) and CPOM (5.7-27.1). The contribution of periphyton to POM of all size fractions had a tendency to increase downstream, though the trend was less clear and varied seasonally for MPOM and CPOM between sites in middle and downstream reaches. Contrastively, the C:N ratio in all size fractions of POM consistently decreased downstream. The downstream decrease in the C:N ratio of POM can be partly explained by the increase in the contribution of periphyton, which seems to be associated with increased discharge and enhanced periphyton dislodgement, especially in winter. In addition, an increase in bacterial biomass associated with the greater nutrient availability in pool areas is another possible reason for the decrease in the C:N ratio of POM downstream.},

Overall, w(s) increased with juvenile size, but considerable variation (similar to 10x) was found within species. Observations indicated that foot movement of juvenile mussels was responsible for reductions in w(s), and this behavior may provide a potential mechanism for habitat selection at small-spatial scales. Observed w(s) differed considerably from w(s) predicted from Stokes' law using empirically determined shell size and density (p = 1.22 +/- 0.003 g/cm(3) for A. ligamentina), which indicates some of the limitations in predicting w(s) from size measurements.},

The highest proportion was found in the first net 4 m downstream (range 0.1-3.6\%), but a small proportion of glochidia was captured 96 m downstream (0-0.03\%). This indicates that infestation of host fish may occur several tens to hundreds of meters downstream of the adults' location, even at relatively low flow conditions (mean velocity, 15 cm s(-1)). Dispersal distances increased with velocity, but the number of glochidia sampled at a given location can vary considerably due to stochastic effects of turbulence, especially at shorter distances. Individual trials could, therefore, deviate considerably from the predictions of an existing turbulent transport model (local exchange model), but overall there was a good correlation between measured data and model prediction. However, model predictions were quantitatively much higher than measured values (i.e., {\textgreater} 50 fold in some cases), which could be in part due to several simplifying assumptions of the model.},

It is well known that when this is the only transport process, extinction is inevitable (the "drift paradox"). Using a series of analytical and numerical models, representing a range of hydrodynamic scenarios, we demonstrate that the action of diffusive dispersal can permit persistence in an advective environment. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is that diffusive dispersal can allow a proportion of the population to reproduce close to their natal location. For well- and poorly mixed non-tidal systems we establish approximate analytic conditions for diffusion-mediated persistence both throughout the water column and in a benthic boundary layer. Although tidal forcing results in residual landward flow near the base of the water column, we find that this has little effect on persistence, which is respectably approximated by our analytic results. We apply these analytic results to four hydrodynamically disparate systems: a stream (Broadstone Stream [UK]), a river (Christiana Creek [USA]), a shallow estuary (Y than [UK]) and a deep fast-flowing estuary (Saco River [USA]), Using parameters derived from published studies we examine the persistence of a number of real and hypothetical organisms in these systems and identify those for which diffusively mediated persistence is a realistic possibility. We note that such persistence is only likely when advection is low or horizontal dispersal is high.},

Levins's metapopulation model suggests that MASH can be estimated by the fraction of empty patches in a network in which the metapopulation occurs at a stochastic steady state. We discuss three reasons why this rule of thumb is likely to give an underestimate, and possibly a severe underestimate, of MASH: the rescue effect, colonization-extinction stochasticity, and nonequilibrium (transient) metapopulation dynamics. The assumption that metapopulations occur at a steady state, common to many models, may be frequently violated because of the high rate of habitat loss and fragmentation in many landscapes. Scores of rare and endangered species may already be ''living dead,'' committed to extinction because extinction is the equilibrium toward which their metapopulations are moving in the present fragmented landscapes. To conserve these species we should reverse the process of habitat loss and fragmentation.},

For example, an animal confined to a river valley or to a particular plant cannot move with equal ease in all directions. We show that spatial architecture could influence the population dynamics of predator-prey systems using individual-based computer simulations parameterized with allometric relationships from the literature. Spatial forms (representing geographical features or plant architecture) of differing fractal dimension were generated, and simulated predators and prey were introduced into these computer environments. We claim that the alteration in interaction rates and population dynamics found in these simulations can be explained as a consequence of the anomalously slow rates of movement associated with fractal spaces and the diffusion-limited nature of predator-prey interactions. As a result, functional responses and numerical responses are substantially reduced in fractal environments, and the overall stability of the system is determined by the interaction between individual mobility and spatial architecture.},

	volume = {84},
	abstract = {Dispersal can strongly influence local population dynamics and may be critical to species persistence in fragmented landscapes. Theory predicts that dispersal by resident stream organisms is necessary to offset the loss of individuals to downstream drift. However, there is a lack of empirical data linking dispersal and drift to local population dynamics in streams, leading to uncertainty regarding the general demographic significance of these processes and the power of drift to explain observed dispersal patterns. I assessed the contribution of dispersal along a first-order stream to population dynamics of the headwater salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (Plethodontidae). I conducted mark-recapture surveys of two contiguous 500 in long sections of a study stream in June, July, and August of 1999, 2000, and 2001. Movement by G. porphyriticus larvae and adults showed a strong upstream bias in the study stream, as well as in 11 other streams that I surveyed. Using mark-recapture models and Akaike's information criterion for model selection, monthly probability of dispersal from the downstream section to the upstream section of the study stream (mean +/- I SE) was estimated to be 0.02 +/- 0.01. The probability of dispersal from the upstream section to the downstream section was 0.00 +/- 0.00. Monthly survival probabilities did not differ between sections. Estimated monthly population growth rates were 1.01 +/- 0.01 in both sections. Net dispersal from the downstream section to the upstream section contributed to the equality of population growth rates. Additionally, reproduction and individual condition were lower in the upstream section, suggesting that population stability and growth there (i.e., lambda greater than or equal to 1.0) may have been dependent on immigration from downstream. Similar interactions between dispersal and variation in local demographic rates along the stream continuum may underlie the distribution and abundance patterns of other organisms at multiple spatial scales. Greater empirical understanding of these interactions will improve conservation of stream biota. The strong upstream bias of G. porphyriticus movement suggests that dispersal is not a response to downstream drift. I propose an alternative model for the evolution of directionally biased dispersal based on the landscape-scale distribution of headwater habitats.},

	abstract = {Adult dispersal and completion of life cycles by aquatic insects are essential for the persistence of populations, colonization of new habitats, and maintenance of genetic diversity. However, life-cycle stages and processes associated with the terrestrial environment often are overlooked when the effect of watershed urbanization on the persistence of insects associated with streams is examined. We reviewed and synthesized current literature on the known effects of watershed urbanization on the terrestrial stage of stream insects. Some research has directly examined the effects of watershed urbanization on dispersal, but much of the evidence we present is indirect and from related studies on aquatic insect life-history traits and dispersal abilities in nonurban watersheds. Our goal is to provide examples of potential impacts that warrant further study, rather than to provide a comprehensive review of all life-history studies. We discuss how watershed land use, riparian condition, and habitat quality affect: 1) adult fitness, 2) adult dispersal, and 3) habitat fragmentation, and 4) how these factors interact with species traits. In general, we found that the local- and landscape-scale changes to stream, riparian, and upland habitats that typically result from anthropogenic activities have the potential to prevent the completion of aquatic insect life cycles and to limit adult dispersal, and therefore, can affect population persistence. When considered within the spatial context of dendritic stream networks, these effects, particularly those on adult dispersal, might have important implications for design and assessment of restoration projects. We discuss a framework for how to determine the relative importance of effects on specific life-cycle stages and processes for the absence of larval populations from urban streams. Overall, more research on terrestrial life-cycle stages and processes and on adult dispersal is required to understand how urbanization might affect population persistence of insects in urban streams.},

Dendritic ecological networks (DENs) include some increasingly threatened ecological systems, such as caves and streams. The restrictive architecture of dendritic ecological networks might have overriding implications for species persistence. I used a modeling approach to investigate how number and spatial arrangement of habitat patches influence metapopulation extinction risk in 2 DENs of different size and topology. Metapopulation persistence was higher in larger networks, but this relationship was mediated by network topology and the dispersal pathways used to navigate the network. Larger networks, especially those with greater topological complexity, generally had lower extinction risk than smaller and less-complex networks, but dispersal bias and magnitude affected the shape of this relationship. Applying these general results to real systems will require empirical data on the movement behavior of organisms and will improve our understanding of the implications of network complexity on population and community patterns and processes.},

The water vole, Arvicola amphibius, is one such species. Water voles have recently undergone a significant decline in the UK, as a result of habitat loss and predation from the introduced American mink, Neovison vison. Large reed bed and grazing marsh sites can provide refuge habitats for water voles from mink predation, in which case populations within these sites could sustain metapopulations in the surrounding landscape where conditions are less favourable. We carried out a study using a stochastic patch occupancy model to determine the long term viability of water vole metapopulations in the wider landscape around a series of extensive reed bed and grazing marsh sites designated as National Key Sites for water voles. The results of our model simulations show that a large protected core site, or mainland, is essential in maintaining the long term viability of these systems. Our results also show how these metapopulations could be enhanced by increasing patch numbers through habitat creation and/or restoration and suggest what the minimum effective size of created or restored patches should be. The study shows how population modelling can provide insight into some effective practical ways of enhancing the viability of water vole metapopulations at the landscape scale. Furthermore it demonstrates that extensive wetlands are an appropriate focus for water vole conservation measures.},

The study area comprised two main habitat types: gravelly areas and riparian grasslands. Among 12 grasshopper species identified, five were more abundant in one of the habitat types and all of them were significantly negatively affected by coverage of weeping lovegrass, whereas seven occurred at the both habitat types simultaneously and a significantly smaller portion of species (two of the seven) was negatively affected by the alien plants.

Field observations and laboratory experiments showed that the grasshopper fed mainly on herbs endemic to the gravelly floodplains, which were negatively impacted by the alien grass. The alien grass was not consumed as food. Field censuses also showed that the abundance of the grasshopper was positively correlated with the coverage of endemic herbs in a plot where weeping lovegrass was not dominant. Dominance of the grass (i.e., habitat modification for E. japonicus) negatively impacted the grasshopper and weakened the positive relationship between the grasshopper and endemic herbs.

	abstract = {Agricultural development to meet rapidly growing demands for food and biofuel and the abandonment of traditional land use have had major impacts on biodiversity. Habitat diversity is one of the most important factors influencing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. In this study we propose an ecological index of ecosystem or habitat diversity in agricultural landscapes - the Satoyama Index (SI) - that is discernible under appropriate spatial units (e.g., 6 km x 6 km) from 1 km x 1 km gridded land-cover data available from an open-access web site. A high SI value is an indicator of high habitat diversity, which is characteristic of traditional agricultural systems, including Japanese satoyama landscapes, while a low value indicates a monotonic habitat condition typical of extensive monoculture landscapes. The index correlated well with the spatial patterns of occurrence of a bird of prey (Butastur indicus) and species richness of amphibians and damselflies in Japan. The values of the SI also corresponded well to the spatial patterns of typical traditional agricultural landscapes with high conservation value in other countries, for example, the dehesas of the Iberian Peninsula and shade coffee landscapes in Central America. Globally, the pattern of East/South-East Asian paddy belts with their high index values contrasts markedly with the low values of the Eurasian, American. and Australian wheat or corn belts. The SI, which correlates landscapes with biodiversity through potential habitat availability, is highly promising for assessing and monitoring the status of biodiversity irrespective of scale.

Some of these invertebrates are more likely to go extinct than their hosts, and under some circumstances, specific actions to conserve the host may be detrimental to the invertebrate. A critical constraint to identifying such invertebrates is uncertainty about their level of host specificity. We used two host-breadth models that explicitly incorporated uncertainty in the host specificity of an invertebrate species. We devised a decision protocol to identify actions that may increase the probability of persistence of a given dependent species. The protocol included estimates from the host-breadth models and decision nodes to identify cothreatened species. We applied the models and protocol to data on 1055 insects (186 species) associated with 2 threatened (as designated by the Australian Government) plant species and 19 plant species that are not threatened to determine whether any insect herbivores have the potential to become extinct if the plant becomes extinct. According to the host-breadth models, 18 species of insect had high host specificity to the threatened plant species. From these 18 insects, the decision protocol highlighted 6 species that had a high probability of extinction if their hosts were to become extinct (3\% of all insects examined). The models and decision protocol have added objectivity and rigor to the process of deciding which dependent invertebrates require conservation action, particularly when dealing with largely unknown and speciose faunas.},

	abstract = {One of the promising approaches to monitoring biodiversity is assessing the status of pressures driving the biodiversity state. To achieve this, we need to identify the principal pressures that cause simultaneous biodiversity loss across taxonomic groups and clarify how multiple pressures act synergistically or at least simultaneously to decrease biodiversity in the focal ecosystem. Here, we used a series of 64 ponds as a case study and we developed a framework for an integrated biodiversity indicator that took into consideration the estimated relative importance of multiple pressures. The indicator is defined as a function of the pressure(s) and is parameterized to explain a number of individual indicators of biodiversity, such as richness, abundance, and functional diversity of focal taxa. We selected aquatic macrophytes, Odonata, and benthic macroinvertebrates as the focal taxa. In addition, we focused on three types of pressure: eutrophication (represented by total phosphorus, total nitrogen, suspended solids, chlorophyll a, and density of cyanobacteria of pond water), habitat destruction (land-use type around the pond and pond bank protection), and invasive alien species (abundance of bluegill, largemouth bass, red swamp crayfish, and American bullfrog). We then evaluated the relationships among direct pressures and the individual biodiversity indicators and used a hierarchical Bayesian approach to calculate the integrated biodiversity indicator. Using this framework, we demonstrated that eutrophication had greater effects on the state of biodiversity of the agricultural ponds than did habitat destruction or the presence of invasive alien species. We also showed that the integrated indicator could well explain the behaviors of several individual biodiversity indicators, including total richness, endangered species richness, and functional diversity of focal taxa. These results demonstrate the advantages of the framework in providing a more practical method for assessing biodiversity, and quantifying the relative importance of the major threats to biodiversity to prioritize strategies in conservation planning and policy making.

	abstract = {Studies on riparian buffers have usually focused on the amount of land needed as habitat for the terrestrial life stages of semiaquatic species. Nevertheless, the landscape surrounding wetlands is also important for other key processes, such as dispersal and the dynamics of metapopulations. Multiple elements that influence these processes should therefore be considered in the delineation of buffers. We analyzed landscape elements (forest cover, density of roads, and hydrographic network) in concentric buffers to evaluate the scale at which they influence stream amphibians in 77 distinct landscapes. To evaluate whether our results could be generalized to other contexts, we determined whether they were consistent across the study areas. Amphibians required buffers of 100-400 m of suitable terrestrial habitat, but interspecific differences in the amount of habitat were large. The presence of amphibians was related to roads and the hydrographic network at larger spatial scales (300-1500 m), which suggests that wider buffers are needed with these elements. This pattern probably arose because these elements influence dispersal and metapopulation persistence, processes that occur at large spatial scales. Furthermore, in some cases, analyses performed on different sets of landscapes provided different results, which suggests caution should be used when conservation recommendations are applied to disparate areas. Establishment of riparian buffers should not be focused only on riparian habitat, but should take a landscape perspective because semiaquatic species use multiple elements for different functions. This approach can be complex because different landscape elements require different spatial extents. Nevertheless, a shift of attention toward the management of different elements at multiple spatial scales is necessary for the long-term persistence of populations.},

To test these predictions, we examined the relative contributions of habitat patch area, connectivity of the regional habitat network and local habitat quality to species richness and total density of butterflies and day-active moths inhabiting semi-natural grasslands. We studied butterflies and moths in 48 replicate landscapes situated in southwest Finland, including a focal patch and the surrounding network of other semi-natural grasslands within a radius of 1.5 km from the focal patch. By applying the method of hierarchical partitioning, which can distinguish between independent and joint contributions of individual explanatory variables, we observed that variables of the local habitat quality (e.g. mean vegetation height and nectar plant abundance) generally showed the highest independent effect on species richness and total density of butterflies and moths. Habitat area did not show a significant independent contribution to species richness and total density of butterflies and moths. The effect of habitat connectivity was observed only for total density of the declining butterflies and moths. These observations indicate that the local habitat quality is of foremost importance in explaining variation in species richness and total density of butterflies and moths. In addition, declining butterflies and moths have larger populations in well-connected networks of semi-natural grasslands. Our results suggest that, while it is crucial to maintain high-quality habitats by management, with limited resources it would be appropriate to concentrate grassland management and restoration to areas with well-connected grassland networks in which the declining species currently have their strongest populations.},

However, for natural populations symmetry is often broken, e.g. for species in the marine environment dispersing through the transport of pelagic larvae with ocean currents. The few recent studies of asymmetric dispersal concluded that asymmetry has a distinct negative impact on the persistence of metapopulations. Detailed analysis, however, revealed that these previous studies might have been unable to properly disentangle the effect of symmetry from other potentially confounding properties of dispersal patterns. We resolve this issue by systematically investigating the symmetry of dispersal patterns and its impact on metapopulation persistence. Our main analysis based on a metapopulation model equivalent to previous studies but now applied on regular dispersal patterns Aims to isolate the effect of dispersal symmetry on metapopulation persistence. Our results suggest that asymmetry in itself does not imply negative effects on metapopulation persistence.

	abstract = {Source populations of polyphagous pests often occur on host plants other than the economically damaged crop. We evaluated the contribution of patches of a non-native meadow grass, Lolium multiflorum Lam.

Periodical censuses of this mind bug by using the sweeping method, vegetation surveys, and statistical analysis revealed that L. multiflorum was the only plant species that was positively correlated with the density of adult S. rubrovittatus through two generations and thus may be the most stable and important host of the mind bug early in the season before the colonization of rice paddies. The risk and cost of such an indirect negative effect on a crop plant through facilitation of a native pest by a non-native plant in the agricultural landscape should not be overlooked.},

	volume = {14},
	abstract = {Understanding how dispersal influences the dynamics of spatially distributed populations is a major priority of both basic and applied ecologists. Two well-known effects of dispersal are spatial synchrony (positively correlated population dynamics at different points in space) and dispersal-induced stability (the phenomenon whereby populations have simpler or less extinction-prone dynamics when they are linked by dispersal than when they are isolated). Although both these effects of dispersal should occur simultaneously, they have primarily been studied separately. Herein, I summarise evidence from the literature that these effects are expected to interact, and I use a series of models to characterise that interaction. In particular, I explore the observation that although dispersal can promote both synchrony and stability singly, it is widely held that synchrony paradoxically prevents dispersal-induced stability. I show here that in many realistic scenarios, dispersal is expected to promote both synchrony and stability at once despite this apparent destabilising influence of synchrony. This work demonstrates that studying the spatial and temporal impacts of dispersal together will be vital for the conservation and management of the many communities for which human activities are altering natural dispersal rates.},

	title = {Evidence for positive density-dependent emigration in butterfly metapopulations},
	volume = {167},
	abstract = {A positive effect of (meta)population density on emigration has been predicted by many theoretical models and confirmed empirically in various organisms. However, in butterflies, the most popular species for dispersal studies, the evidence for its existence has so far been equivocal, with negative relationships between density and emigration being reported more frequently. We analysed dispersal in sympatric metapopulations of two Maculinea butterflies, intensively surveyed with mark-release-recapture methods for 7 years. Dispersal parameters, derived using the virtual migration model, were assessed against butterfly densities, which fluctuated strongly over the study period. Emigration was positively correlated with density, and this effect was particularly strong at densities above carrying capacity, when emigration increased up to threefold in females and twofold in males compared with the normal levels. In turn, density had little impact on other dispersal parameters analysed. Our findings provide good evidence for positive density-dependence of emigration in butterflies. Emigrating at high densities is particularly beneficial for females, because it gives them a chance to lay part of their egg-load in less crowded patches, where offspring survival is higher due to lower intraspecific competition. Even though the rise in emigration becomes considerable at densities exceeding carrying capacity, i.e. relatively infrequently, it still has serious implications for many ecological phenomena, such as species range expansions, gene flow, and metapopulation persistence. Consequently, instead of treating emigration as a fixed trait, it is worth allowing for its density-dependence in applications such as population viability analyses, genetic models or metapopulation models.},

	title = {Do all inter-patch movements represent dispersal? {A} mixed kernel study of butterfly mobility in fragmented landscapes},
	volume = {80},
	abstract = {1. In times of ongoing habitat fragmentation, the persistence of many species is determined by their dispersal abilities. Consequently, understanding the rules underlying movement between habitat patches is a key issue in conservation ecology. 2. We have analysed mark-release-recapture (MRR) data on inter-patches movements of the Dusky Large Blue butterfly Maculinea nausithous in a fragmented landscape in northern Bavaria, Germany. The aim of the analysis was to quantify distance dependence of dispersal as well as to evaluate the effect of target patch area on immigration probability. For statistical evaluation, we apply a 'reduced version' of the virtual migration model (VM), only fitting parameters for dispersal distance and immigration. In contrast to other analyses, we fit a mixed dispersal kernel to the MRR data. 3. A large fraction of recaptures happened in other habitat patches than those where individuals were initially caught. Further, we found significant evidence for the presence of a mixed dispersal kernel. The results indicate that individuals follow different strategies in their movements. Most movements are performed over small distances, nonetheless involving travelling between nearby habitat patches (median distance c. 480 m). A small fraction (c. 0 025) of the population has a tendency to move over larger distances (median distance c. 3800 m). Further, immigration was positively affected by patch area (I similar to A(zeta)), with the scaling parameter zeta = 0.5. 4. Our findings should help to resolve the long-lasting dispute over the suitability of the negative exponential function vs. inverse-power one for modelling dispersal. Previous studies on various organisms found that the former typically gives better overall fit to empirical distance distributions, but that the latter better represents long-distance movement probabilities. As long-distance movements are more important for landscape-level effects and thus, e. g. for conservation-oriented analyses like PVAs, fitting inverse-power kernels has often been preferred. 5. We conclude that the above discrepancy may simply stem from the fact that recorded inter-patch movements are an outcome of two different processes: daily routine movements and genuine dispersal. Consequently, applying mixed dispersal kernels to disentangle the two processes is recommended.},

For coral reef fishes, while there are some empirical estimates of self-recruitment at isolated populations, exchange among sub-populations has been rarely quantified. Here, we used microsatellite DNA markers and a likelihood-based parentage analysis to assess the relative magnitude of self-recruitment and exchange among eight geographically distinct sub-populations of the panda clownfish Amphiprion polymnus along 30 km of coastline near Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. In addition, we used an assignment/exclusion test to identify immigrants arriving from genetically distinct sources. Overall, 82 per cent of the juveniles were immigrants while 18 per cent were progeny of parents genotyped in our focal metapopulation. Of the immigrants, only 6 per cent were likely to be genetically distinct from the focal metapopulation, suggesting most of the connectivity is among sub-populations from a rather homogeneous genetic pool. Of the 18 per cent that were progeny of known adults, two-thirds dispersed among the eight sub-populations and only one-third settled back into natal sub-populations. Comparison of our data with previous studies suggested that variation in dispersal distances is likely to be influenced by the geographical setting and spacing of sub-populations.},

Based on the theoretical information approach of Akaike's information criterion, generalized linear mixed models were constructed. These revealed that the species' occurrence is strongly affected by five major factors: the presence of freshwater mussels Anodonta sp., water depth, floating plants coverage, the presence of bullfrogs, and submerged plants coverage. The probability of the presence of T. lanceolata was higher at shallower sites with lower floating plants coverage, located within channels containing mussel beds.

On the regional scale, we found that mussels with the most precarious conservation status relied on host fish with short movement distances, whereas vulnerable and more secure mussel species had host fish with 2-3 orders of magnitude larger movement distances. We were not able to detect a clear pattern on the catchment scale. 4. Our results suggest that limited dispersal by host fish affects the abundance and distribution of unionid mussels and ultimately their conservation status on a regional scale. Information on dispersal limitations because of differences in host fish communities should be included in conservation and management decisions to ensure connectivity and maintain functioning mussel metacommunities.},

	abstract = {1. Dams, ubiquitous features in many lotic ecosystems, are believed to have many broad-ranging and predominantly negative effects on stream biota. Whereas the impacts of larger dams are well studied, few studies have quantified effects of small dams on streams. 2. Recent surveys found numerous locations where mussels were abundant and larger in reaches immediately downstream from small dams. We examined mussel shell growth and resource conditions in Sandy Creek, a small (third-order) tributary of the Tallapoosa River in east-central Alabama (U. S. A.), to determine whether larger populations and individuals result from more rapid growth or longer lifespans of mussels downstream from the dam. 3. Growth rates for populations occurring immediately downstream from the dam (mill reach), c. 5 km downstream from the dam (downstream reach) and upstream from the impoundment (upstream reach) were compared with environmental conditions (seasonal measures of nutrient concentrations and water chemistry) and food availability [ total suspended solids (TSS)]. Water temperature was continuously monitored using data loggers. 4. Analysis of length-at-age data using multiple growth models found that mill reach mussels grew faster than both up-and downstream populations. This dam appears to substantially increase water temperatures and may extend the shell growth period in the mill reach. TSS quantity varied seasonally between sites but was generally highest in the impoundment and mill reach during spring and autumn. TSS quality was highest in the upstream reach from spring through autumn but was highest in the impoundment and mill reach during winter. 5. Our data suggest that some small impoundments enhance conditions for freshwater mussel growth in downstream reaches. However, we do not know how far downstream this subsidy extends or how different species respond to mill dam augmentation. Regardless, mounting evidence suggests that this phenomenon is geographically and taxonomically widespread in eastern North America. Heretofore, undocumented positive effects of small dams suggest that some older dams may warrant protection or restoration if downstream reaches support imperilled mussel populations. Further, some small dams may prove useful conservation tools for natural resource managers attempting to identify sites for mussel culture facilities or translocation refugia.},

Twenty-three years of research in headwater streams in the Klamath-Siskiyou and North Coast Bioregions of the Pacific Northwest, U.S.A., showed distinct patterns in the distribution of amphibians to variations in water temperature, \% fine sediments and the amount of large woody debris (LWD). 3. Here, we review seven studies that demonstrate connections between species presence and abundance and these three in-stream variables. These data were then used to calculate realized niches for three species, the southern torrent salamander, the larval coastal tailed frog and the larval coastal giant salamander, relative to two of these environmental stressors (water temperature and \% fine sediments). Moreover, multivariate generalized additive models were used to predict the presence of these three amphibians when these three stressors act in concert. 4. Stream-dwelling amphibians are shown to be extremely sensitive to changes in water temperature, amounts of fine sediment and LWD, and specific thresholds and ranges for a spectrum of animal responses can be used to manage for headwater tributary ecosystem integrity. 5. Consequently, amphibians can provide a direct metric of stream ecosystem integrity acting as surrogates for the ability of a stream network to support other stream-associated biota, such as salmonids, and their related ecological services.},

We added 25 live mucket (Actinonaias ligamentina) and 25 live kidneyshell (Ptychobranchus fasciolaris) mussels in 0.5 m(2) cells (100 mussels/m(2)) and used adjacent cells without mussels as a control. Sediment cohesion (sediment shear strength and compression) was measured before and every 1-2 weeks after mussels were added to the cells. Sediment erosion was measured on Weeks 1 and 4 during high flow events created by increasing flow rates to 15 cm/s for 2.75 h. Streambed sediments were destabilized when mussels were burrowing, but sediments were stabilized when mussels were sessile. Unionid mussels decreased shear strength in Week 1 as they repositioned themselves in the cells. However by Week 4, shear strength was 24\% higher and compression was 31\% higher in cells with embedded mussels than in control treatments. Mussel presence had no detectable effect on amount or grain size of sediments that were eroded during high flow events. These results suggest that physical characteristics of the streambed can be altered by high density mussel beds, which may impact benthic biotic communities.},

In field observations, larger and older salmon inhabited cooler areas, whereas smaller and younger salmon inhabited warmer areas. These patterns were consistent with a size-dependent effect of temperature on condition factor, a parameter shown experimentally to be a measure of the most recent growth performance. Temperatures for maximising condition factor were lower for larger fish. Thus, an ontogenetic change in individual thermal preference toward cooler areas maximises the growth performance of fish, and the negative effects of climate warming on growth are hypothesised to be more severe for larger fish.},

This potential weakness in ecological interpretation can be overcome by using other investigative tools that provide precise information about individual movement patterns. In this paper, we demonstrate the value of combining SIA with telemetry or mark-recapture data from trapping, electrofishing and remote detection of individuals to study the movement and feeding ecology of fishes in different habitats. In a fjord lake system in Newfoundland, Canada, juvenile Atlantic salmon delayed downstream migration (smolts) or actively moved into a large lake (part) where they foraged for periods reflecting different life history strategies. In the Miramichi River (New Brunswick, Canada), SIA provided evidence of distinct foraging habitats (tributary versus large river). By tracking fish implanted with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, we distinguished between movements related to foraging versus seeking cool water refugia during high temperature events. Finally, site fidelity and limited mobility of slimy sculpin, a small benthic fish, was established where delta(13)C in muscle tissue showed a progressive enrichment downstream and where a median displacement of {\textless} 10 in was estimated for sculpin tagged with PIT tags. Technological improvements have permitted non-destructive tissue sampling of wild fishes for SIA, and the tagging and remote detection of animals smaller than was previously possible. These advancements and the combination of investigative tools promise new insights into animal ecology.},

	abstract = {1. An internationally important population of the freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) was rediscovered in a small river in north-west Russia. 2. A survey of visible mussels in 2008/2009 indicated an estimated population of 40 000 individuals. This is the largest population currently known in the Leningrad oblast and is comparable with the entire pearl mussel population of some western European countries. 3. The average density of visible mussels was 29.6 individuals m(-2) in the middle part of the river. In the four largest mussel beds maximum densities of 1000+ individuals m(-2) were recorded. Such densities are exceptional and have not been reported elsewhere in Europe during the last 100 years. 4. Live juvenile mussels were recorded, indicating that that this population is viable, although further investigation is required to establish its status. 5. Analysis of the population age structure, based on the measurement of empty shells, showed an age class distribution similar to those reported for other healthy Margaritifera populations. 6. Only two live juveniles were found. However, this is likely to be due to the survey being restricted to counts of visible mussels only, and the age structure being based on the analysis of dead shells. 7. The population's current status and possible reasons for its survival in this river are discussed. Conservation measures should include the construction of a fish ladder to make fish migration through the culvert possible, removal of a metal screen preventing fish migration from the upper reaches of the river to the lake, reduction of recreation activities, and providing the local children's camp with water treatment facilities.

The flexible framework means that parameters, variables and latent variables can represent broader classes of model elements than are treated in traditional models. Inference and prediction depend on two types of stochasticity, including (1) uncertainty, which describes our knowledge of fixed quantities, it applies to all 'unobservables' (latent variables and parameters), and it declines asymptotically with sample size, and (2) variability, which applies to fluctuations that are not explained by deterministic processes and does not decline asymptotically with sample size.

	abstract = {1. The effects of habitat quality, patch size and connectivity between patches on patterns of local extinction and colonization of collared pikas were studied over 7 years in alpine meadows in the south-west Yukon. 2. Although adult population size independently had a significant influence on patch extinction, its influence was minimal when other variables were included in generalized linear models. Instead, an index of habitat quality and the connectivity of a patch were found to be the best predictors of pika extinction. 3. Similarly, patch connectivity only partly explained the recolonization of talus patches by pikas. Other patch characteristics, including aspect, amount of vegetation within the patch and an index of habitat quality based on survival probability of pikas also had a significant influence on recolonization. 4. These results suggest that the influence of patch quality on local extinction and recolonization need to be more fully incorporated into metapopulation models.},

	title = {Lasting effects of maternal behaviour on the distribution of a dispersive stream insect},
	volume = {80},
	abstract = {1. Predicting population dynamics at large spatial scales requires integrating information about spatial distribution patterns, inter-patch movement rates and within-patch processes. Advective dispersal of aquatic species by water movement is considered paramount to understanding their population dynamics. Rivers are model advective systems, and the larvae of baetid mayflies are considered quintessential dispersers. Egg laying of baetids along channels is patchy and reflects the distribution of oviposition sites, but larvae are assumed to drift frequently and far, thereby erasing patterns created during oviposition. Dispersal kernels are often overestimated, however, and empirical tests of such assumptions are warranted because of the pivotal role distribution patterns can have on populations. 2. We tested empirically whether the egg distribution patterns arising from oviposition behaviours persisted and were reflected in the distribution patterns of larval Baetis rhodani. In field surveys, we tested for associations between egg mass and larval densities over 1 km lengths of four streams. A control species, the mayfly Ephemerella ignita, was employed to test for covarying environmental factors. We estimated drift rates directly to test whether larvae dispersed between riffles (patches of high egg mass density) and whether drift rates were density-dependent or density-related expected outcomes if drift erases patterns established by maternal behaviours. 3. Positive associations between egg masses and larval benthic densities were found for neonate and mid-stage larvae of Baetis, but not the control species, suggesting persistence of the patchy distribution patterns established at oviposition. Drift rates were high, and riffles were net exporters of neonate and mid-stage larvae, but drift rates were unrelated to benthic densities and few drifters reached the next riffle. Riffles were sinks for large larvae, suggesting ontogenetic shifts in habitat use, but little long-distance dispersal. 4. Overall, the results suggest that most neonate and mid-stage larvae of B. rhodani remain close to the natal riffle, and late-stage larvae disperse shorter distances than routinely assumed. The persistence of maternal effects on distribution patterns well into juvenile life of an allegedly iconic disperser suggests that traditional models of how dispersal influences the population dynamics of many lotic invertebrates may be incorrect.},

	abstract = {Substrate stability in streams is fundamental to benthic communities, many of which decline in biomass and taxon richness with decreased stability. Although of obvious importance in describing a stream's disturbance regime, substrate movement is often difficult to quantify accurately. Traditional techniques rely either on subjective scoring systems (e.g, Pfankuch stability score), or require repeated site visits to follow downstream displacement of painted stones. Newbury's Instability Index measures substrate movement based on calculations of a stream's tractive force at bankfull discharge, but the assumptions on which this method is based limit its use to lowland streams. We have developed a new method to assess substrate movement suitable for shallow, steep mountain streams with a high bed roughness, based on an extensive review of existing hydraulic literature We calculated the \% of the streambed in motion at bankfull discharge (P-BF) in 48 New Zealand headwater streams using our method, the Instability Index, and Pfankuch score. Concordance analysis showed that the 3 methods of assessing substrate stability ranked the 48 streams differently. We next related the 3 stability measures to aquatic bryophyte cover because these plants are good biological indicators of substrate stability. We observed a highly significant correlation (p {\textless} 0.001) between P-BF and bryophyte cover, a weaker correlation between the Pfankuch score and bryophyte cover (p = 0.023), but no significant relationship between cover and the Instability Index. These results suggested that our method is a useful and potentially powerful tool to accurately quantify substrate movement in steep headwater streams.},

The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), is currently invading North American forests at variable rates, spreading by local and long-distance movement in a process known as stratified dispersal. Newly arriving colonizers often occur considerably ahead of the population front, and a key question is the degree to which they successfully establish. Prior research has highlighted mate-finding failures in sparse populations as a cause of an Allee effect (positive density dependence). We explored this mechanism by measuring the relationship between female mating success and background male moth densities along the gypsy moth western front in Northern Wisconsin (USA) over 2 years. The mating results were then compared with analogous previous studies in southern Wisconsin, and the southern front in West Virginia and Virginia (USA). Mate-finding failures in low-density populations were consistently observed to be density-dependent across all years and locations. Mate-finding failures in low-density populations have important ramifications to invasive species management, particularly in predicting species invasiveness, preventing successful establishment by small founder populations, and concentrating eradication efforts where they are most likely to succeed.},

We tested this approach for 99 stream reaches and nine aquatic taxa in New Zealand. The resulting generalized habitat models predict habitat values similar to those predicted by conventional models from simplified hydraulic data (depth-discharge and width-discharge relationships, average particle size, and mean annual discharge). As in France, within-reach changes in habitat values were linked to the specific discharge of reaches, while between-reach changes depended mainly on the Froude number at mean annual discharge.

	abstract = {1. Bottom-up approaches based on individual behaviour can help to identify key variables influencing populations at larger scales. Instream habitat models have been developed to predict the consequences, for populations in stream reaches, of fish preferences for particular hydraulic conditions observed at the scale of individuals. Conventional instream habitat models (e.g. PHABSIM) predict habitat values for species or life stages in reaches, and their changes with discharge. Despite their worldwide use, they have been subject to continuing criticism and have been mainly limited to site-specific case studies. 2. We ran conventional instream habitat models in 58 French stream reaches dominated by brown trout. Using non-linear mixed effect models, we demonstrated that the outputs of instream habitat models (habitat values for three trout life stages and five other species) are predictable from average characteristics of reaches (discharge, depth, width and bed particle size). 3. Our models closely reflect variations in habitat values within-reaches (with discharge) and between-reaches. Within-reach changes are linked to the Reynolds number of reaches, while between-reach changes depend mainly on the Froude number at median daily discharge. These two dimensionless variables combine discharge, mean depth and mean width of reaches. Independent model validations showed robust model predictions that are consistent with studies of habitat values for brown trout made in larger streams from western North America. 4. Our results contribute to identifying the main hydraulic variables governing estimates of fish habitat values. They should facilitate habitat studies in multiple streams, at the basin or larger scales, while reducing their cost. They should enhance the biological validation of habitat model predictions, which remains critical.},

Plant size traits and reproductive traits (bud, flower, green fruit, and mature fruit) were recorded through the ensuing summer. Fruit production per flower and per plant increased in proportion to flowering population size (p = 0.0063 and p = 0.0017, respectively), strongly suggesting that an Allee effect occurs in very small populations. The increase in fruit production was not explained by either plant or inflorescence size differences. Although population size-dependent pollination, through insufficient pollinator visitation rate or pollen transfer rate, seems the most likely cause of the observed effects, our limited observations of pollinators were not sufficient to demonstrate a change in pollination rates as a function of population size. Knowledge of the presence as well as the mechanism underlying this Allee effect may be especially useful for management and determination of minimum viable population size of the species in the wild.},

Relative attractiveness of females compared with traps was 0.23, which is similar to earlier estimated relative attractiveness of females in Virginia. The mortality of females from predation, however, was found to be significantly lower in Wisconsin than in Virginia, which may contribute to a larger degree of mating success. Increased long-distance dispersal of males could also contribute to the increased mating success of females. The higher rate of spread of gypsy moth populations in Wisconsin compared with other areas may be due to the increased mating success caused by the lower female mortality and higher long-distance dispersal of males.},

In addition, ecologists increasingly recognize that fluxes of organisms across ecosystem boundaries can have major consequences for community dynamics(5,6). Species with complex life histories often shift habitats during their life cycles(7) and provide potent conduits coupling ecosystems(5,6). Thus, local interactions that affect predator abundance in one ecosystem ( for example a larval habitat) may have reverberating effects in another ( for example an adult habitat). Here we show that fish indirectly facilitate terrestrial plant reproduction through cascading trophic interactions across ecosystem boundaries. Fish reduce larval dragonfly abundances in ponds, leading to fewer adult dragonflies nearby. Adult dragonflies consume insect pollinators and alter their foraging behaviour. As a result, plants near ponds with fish receive more pollinator visits and are less pollen limited than plants near fish-free ponds. Our results confirm that strong species interactions can reverberate across ecosystems, and emphasize the importance of landscape-level processes in driving local species interactions.},

	abstract = {We investigated the aquatic and riparian herpetofauna in a 789 km2 river catchment in northwest California to examine competing theories of biotic community structuring in catchment stream networks. Research in fluvial geomorphology has resulted in multi-scale models of dynamic processes that cyclically create, maintain, and destroy environments in stream networks of mountain catchments. These models have been applied to understanding distributions of invertebrates, algae, fishes and their habitats across entire basin networks, but similar approaches with herpetofauna are rare. We examined multi-scale spatial patterns of multiple species as they related to variation in channel types, channel settings, and within-channel attributes that result from these processes. From 83 reaches distributed randomly throughout the watershed, we distinguished four channel types: 1) high gradient with cascade structure; 2) 2-4\% gradient with step-pool structure controlled by moderately steep valleys; 3) slightly entrenched, lower gradient, plane-bed structure; and 4) low gradient, shallow, unconfined, multiple or migrating pool/riffle channels in broad alluvial valleys. The composition of herpetofauna differed in five of six pair-wise comparisons among these channel types, indicating a minimum of three distinct mesoscale assemblages. We used non-parametric multiple regression (NPMR) to examine relationships at multiple spatial scales. NPMR revealed species-specific associations with channel settings and within-channel environments among species sharing the same sets of channel types. Morphological adaptations, biophysical limits and natural histories of each species best explained their associations with distinct sets of attributes surrounding and within channel types. While each set of species has similarly adapted to fluvial and geomorphic disturbance processes structuring channels at the mesoscale, species within each set have adapted to a unique set of attributes that are best discerned when their spatial relationships are examined across multiple spatial scales. We evaluated the various spatial patterns against hypotheses of stream community organization and metacommunity perspectives.},

This paper describes the biogeography and diversity of Unionidae along climate and habitat gradients in Texas, evaluates human impact, and identifies the hot spots of diversity and endemism that should be targeted for conservation. Location Texas, North America. Methods Unionids were surveyed in all major Texas river basins in 2003-2009. Multivariate statistics were used to test for differences in environmental parameters and among unionid assemblages in different bioprovinces, and to determine to what extent the multivariate pattern of species distribution was affected by environmental factors. To estimate human impact, we examined the relationship between human population density and the proportion of rare species, as well with the proportion of historically present species that persist in the watershed. Results Correlation between biotic and environmental similarity matrices indicated concordance in the differences among unionid assemblages and environmental factors that could cause these differences. Lake surface evaporation rate and percentage of forest cover in the watershed were among the most important parameters explaining the differences in unionid assemblages. Human population density was negatively correlated with the proportion of rare species. The proportion of species found live relative to the total number of live and relic species found in our surveys and to the number of historically known species decreased with the increase in human population density. Main conclusions Climate, landscape, geology, and land use type were important factors influencing unionid distribution patterns among biotic provinces. Increased human population density was associated with the loss of rare species over several decades, but this loss was not recognized because of a lack of assessing the conservation status of unionids.},

However, analyses have had limited success owing in part to the expectation that simple linear expressions accurately predict threshold entraintment (i.e., initiation of bed movement) over a broad range of hydraulic conditions from low-gradient sand-bed rivers through high-gradient boulder-bed rivers. Examination of the literature revealed ambiguity of terminology and use of equations without the proper adherence to limitations and assumptions inherent in the derivation of the equations. We present the derivations of the founding equations of flow competence, and discuss their applications, assumptions, and limitations. We also examine the efficacy of a stream stability index based on the ratio of estimated bottom boundary shear stress applied to the bed during bankfull conditions, and the critical entrainment shear stress calculated from the size of the surface bed material. Data from 33 gravel- to boulder-bed river sites were used to evaluate the stream stability index as a predictor of bed movement. The stability index indicated that a bankfull discharge would not generate critical threshold entrainment for 28 of the 33 sites, with most sites requiring a 2-fold increase in bottom boundary shear stress to mobilize the riverbed gravel and cobbles, and nearly an order of magnitude increase in shear stress to mobilize boulders. We conclude that other factors affecting the possible range of variation in flow velocity, particle size distributions, bed packing, and momentum exchange from collisions between saltating particles and those at rest on the bed may lead to departures between predicted and actual streambed movement. Hence, flow-competence approaches to predicting streambed instability should be used only to objectively bracket ranges of variation in disturbance and streambed movement. Moreover, the assumptions and limitations of equations for such indices should be investigated carefully before elaborate statistical analysis of watershed or streambed variables are undertaken to explain deviations from theoretical estimates, or to explain why a particular index does or does not predict bed movement.},

	title = {Behaviour during elevated water temperatures: can physiology explain movement of juvenile {Atlantic} salmon to cool water?},
	volume = {80},
	abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Temperature governs most physiological processes in animals. Ectotherms behaviourally thermoregulate by selecting habitats with temperatures regulating their body temperature for optimal physiological functioning. However, ectotherms can experience temperature extremes forcing the organisms to seek temperature refuge. 2. Fish actively avoid potentially lethal temperatures by moving to cool-water sites created by inflowing tributaries and groundwater seeps. Juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) of different age classes exhibit different behavioural responses to elevated temperatures ({\textgreater} 23 degrees C). Yearling (1+) and 2-year-old (2+) Atlantic salmon often cease feeding, abandon territorial behaviour and swim continuously in aggregations in cool-water sites; whereas young-of-the-year (0+) fish continue defending territories and foraging. 3. This study determined whether the behavioural shift in older individuals (2+) occurred when basal metabolic rate, driven by increasing water temperature, reached the maximum metabolic rate such that anaerobic pathways were recruited to provide energy to support vital processes. Behaviour (feeding and stress responses), oxygen consumption, muscle lactate and glycogen, and circulating blood lactate and glucose concentrations were measured in wild 0+ and 2+ Atlantic salmon acclimated to water temperatures between 16 and 28 degrees C. 4. Results indicate that oxygen consumption of the 2+ fish increased with temperature and reached a plateau at 24 degrees C, a temperature that corresponded to cessation of feeding and a significant increase in muscle and blood lactate levels. By contrast, oxygen consumption in 0+ fish did not reach a plateau, feeding continued and muscle lactate did not increase, even at the highest temperatures tested (28 degrees C). 5. To conclude, the experiment demonstrated that the 0+ and 2+ fish had different physiological responses to the elevated water temperatures. The results suggest that wild 2+ Atlantic salmon employ behavioural responses (e.g. movement to cool-water sites) at elevated temperatures in an effort to mitigate physiological imbalances associated with an inability to support basal metabolism through aerobic metabolic processes.},

	title = {Restricted movement in stream fish: {The} paradigm is incomplete, not lost},
	volume = {83},
	abstract = {The "restricted-movement paradigm" (RMP) states that adult fish in streams are sedentary and spend most of their lives in short (20-50 m) reaches of stream. In mark-recapture studies. however, many fish initially marked are often never recaptured. As well, turnover rates of individuals in the home section (where fish were originally marked) can be high when marked fish moving out are rapidly replaced by unmarked ones. Recent challenges to the RMP have been based on the inference that high turnover indicates high mobility. However, when the home section is small many individuals may leave (high turnover) but not move far away (low displacement). I present two models for the frequency distribution of displacement distances: one represents populations as homogeneous ensembles with a single mobility parameter; the second represents populations as a mixture of stationary and mobile individuals. Both readily distinguish the turnover and displacement components of movement and show that high turnover rate is compatible with low displacement. The models were then fit to dispersal curves for six species of stream salmonids in 27 populations. Empirical estimates of turnover rate were high (median: 0.53), variable among populations (range: 0.15-0.78), but unrelated to displacement distance. Median displacement was {\textless} 100 In for 24 populations and was typically {\textless} 50 m. The proportion of mobile individuals was low in most populations (median: 19\%) and exceeded 50\% in only five of the populations. Brook trout, a species central to studies critical of the RMP appeared to be exceptionally mobile relative to other salmonids. The compatibility of high turnover rates with short displacement distances and the finding that median displacement was usually limited support the notion that restricted movement is the norm in populations of stream salmonids during nonmigratory periods. However, the finding of considerable intra- and interspecific heterogeneity in the extent of movement underscores the potential importance of the mobile component to population processes. By providing an analytical framework that yields quantitative measures of different components of movement and allows for standardized comparisons, these models can bring needed rigor to analysis and design in movement studies.},

One circumstance in which it may arise is when isolated individuals are less effective in modifying their environment in a favourable way than groups of individuals. In this paper we use Porcellio scaber to test the hypothesis that the fitness correlate of growth rate will vary as a function of density not just due to the negative effects of increasing interference competition whilst foraging at higher densities, but also positively at lower densities due to isolated individuals spending more time and energy searching for other individuals with which to aggregate whilst sheltering. Below densities of 70 m(-2) relative growth rates increased as a function of density, above 70 m(-2) growth rate decreased with increasing density. Time spent walking and searching increased at lower densities. These behavioural observations, together with the original observations on water loss and oxygen consumption made by Allee [1], are used to interpret the curvilinear growth rate response to density as an example of a component Allee effect, which is discussed in relation to the importance of aggregation as an adaptation to the terrestrial environment in the Oniscidea.

We examined density and scale dependence in a patterned, soft sediment mussel bed. We followed mussel growth and density at two spatial scales separated by four orders of magnitude. In summer, competition was important at both scales. In winter, there was net facilitation at the small scale with no evidence of density dependence at the large scale. The mechanism for facilitation is probably density dependent protection from wave dislodgement. Intraspecific interactions in soft sediment mussel beds thus vary both temporally and spatially. Our data support the idea that pattern formation in ecological systems arises from competition at large scales and facilitation at smaller scales, so far only shown in vegetation systems. The data, and a simple, heuristic model, also suggest that facilitative interactions in sessile biota are mediated by physical stress, and that interactions change in strength and sign along a spatial or temporal gradient of physical stress.},

	abstract = {Earlier research has shown that the koinobiont parasitoid, Microplitis rufiventris, attacks and can develop on early instars of Spodoptera littoralis larvae with preference to third instars. However, the present study was carried out using the newly moulted sixth instar larvae at two different temperatures (20 +/- 1 and 27 +/- 1 degrees C) to study the developmental interaction between the parasitoid and the last instar host larvae, Parasitoid eggs laid in singly parasitized host larvae invariably died, As the number of parasitoid eggs, host larvae increased, the proportion of eggs that hatched and number of viable parasitoid larvae successfully reached to their final instar increased. The effect of superparasitization seems to be dose (no. of eggs + parasitoid factors)-temperature-dependent. The results demonstrate a kind of 'Allee effect' suggesting that superparasitized last instar S. littoralis larvae provide a better host environment than singly parasitized hosts for the parasitoid, AT rufiventris. This may be due to host's hormone and/or low dose of factors injected with parasitoid eggs. The supernumerary individuals or wasp larvae developed normally to the point of emergence but most did not successfully emerge from the host, The improvement or both hatchability and post-embryonic development of parasitoid wasp was significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) greater at 20 degrees C than at 27 degrees C. The results of the present study are useful in understanding the evolution of life-history strategies and host range in parasitic hymenoptera.},

	abstract = {Stream-dwelling fish populations have long served as important models of animal movement. Populations of adult stream-dwelling fishes are generally composed of a mix of relatively sedentary and mobile individuals. However, we do not know whether this pattern that we typically observe among adults is indicative of patterns of movement that occur throughout the life cycle. Therefore, we do not know whether we can apply these patterns to understanding or predicting processes such as migration and thus the potential for the evolution of genetic differences among populations. We test the general hypothesis that patterns of movement throughout the life cycle are consistent with patterns of movement inferred by indirect genetic methods and, more specifically, that the characteristics of the mobile fraction of the population are consistent with patterns of genetic differentiation. We used parentage analyses to infer the movements of alevin brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) in Freshwater River, Newfoundland, Canada, and a capture-recapture study of one cohort in this population to infer movement throughout the rest of the life cycle. We found that alevins move large distances shortly after emergence, primarily in the downstream direction, and that the population is composed of a mix of relatively sedentary and mobile individuals throughout all other intervals of the life cycle. In contrast, when we considered movements of individuals first captured as juveniles and eventually recovered as reproductively mature adults, we found relatively large and uniform distributions of net movement distance. Thus, heterogeneity in individual movement of adults is not representative of patterns of movement throughout the life cycle and therefore may provide only limited inference of population-level processes such as gene flow.},

In one small tributary, water temperature was relatively high during the winter, and populations of salmon and trout increased through immigration at this time of the year, becoming dominant components of the salmonid assemblage; the density of charr in this stream decreased during the winter, but charr was dominant during the summer. In another medium-sized tributary, the water temperature fell to close to 0A degrees C during the winter, and densities of salmon and charr decreased in this season, through emigration; trout were very rare in this stream. Seasonal patterns of stream salmonid densities vary among species and between localities, resulting in seasonal changes in species composition.

Of the marked fish, 31.3-58.3\% were recaptured in the same pools where they had been caught during the study periods of summer (June-August), autumn (August-November) and winter-spring (November to the next June) and no seasonal movement was observed. The mean distances that the fish moved during the study periods ranged from 139.0 to 502.3 m and many movements longer than 1000 m were observed. Between the resident and the moved fish, there was little difference in body length, growth rate or sex. For the fish that had been resident in the same pools and riffles at previous recaptures, most fish were recaptures in the same locations at the next recapture. Conversely, for the fish that moved previously, most fish were recaptured in different locations from previous sites at the next recapture. These results suggest that Japanese charr exhibit relatively high residency throughout the year, but many fish moved longer distance. The results also suggest the presence of static and mobile components in the charr population.},

	abstract = {We investigated the response of Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (Plethodontidae), the spring salamander, to timber harvest in headwater streams in New Hampshire (U.S.A.). We conducted cover-controlled, whole-stream surveys for G. porphyriticus in 25 first-order streams in drainages encompassing a range of timber-harvest histories. Streams in two different landscape configurations were chosen, isolated, or paired, based on the presence or absence of a confluent first-order stream-a potential source of immigrants. The analyzed salamander abundance with respect to logging history, presence of the brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), salamander population connectivity, and other measures of physical habitat and aquatic conditions. In stepwise multiple-regression analysis, the best multivariate model of G. porphyriticus abundance included fish presence/absence; effect category, a combined junction of years since harvest and substrate embeddedness by fine sediment; and landscape configuration. These three factors explained 74\% of the variation in G. porphyriticus abundance. G. porphyriticus was less abundant in streams where fish were present, likely because of predation by S. fontinalis or asymmetric competition between these species. Abundance also declined with increasing substrate embeddedness and/or decreasing years since harvest, indicating an effect of fine sediment inputs and harvest history on this species. Finally, G. porphyriticus was less abundant in isolated streams than in paired streams, This result suggests that landscape-scale population connectivity may buffer this species from the negative effects of local (i.e., stream-scale) habitat perturbation. We hope this work will encourage others to develop multiscale models of land-use effects on stream biota and thereby ultimately increase the range and effectiveness of conservation strategies for these species.},

Objectives included addressing what made up the diet of these bivalves and whether suspended algae consumed by bivalves were derived from pelagic phytoplankton imported from an upstream lake or attached algae sloughed from instream surfaces. Within the examination of bivalve diets, we considered whether suspension- and/or deposit-feeding modes were employed and whether bivalves selectively assimilated the algal and microbial portions of bulk material they ingested. All 12 unionid species reached a level of N-15 enrichment greater than the bulk suspended organic matter. Sphaerium striatinum (Sphaeriidae) were enriched to levels greater than all presumed food sources. Suspended algae were derived both from sloughed epilithon and pelagic phytoplankton originating from lentic waters upstream. A mixing model suggested that unionids were consuming 80\% deposited and 20\% suspended material. Alternatively, these bivalves were preferentially assimilating the highly enriched living component of suspended and/or benthic organic matter rather than assimilating the bulk material. These results advance our understanding of freshwater bivalve-feeding ecology, which is necessary if conservation efforts of these increasingly threatened organisms are to succeed.},

Translocated animals grew at rates similar to control animals, especially if moved upstream, but moved at greater rates, especially in high-density riffles. Growth rates differed between streams, and were greater in riffles than in pools; pools, where resident mussels are rare, may be suboptimal habitats for growth. Density had variable effects on growth, and growth rates in some cases actually increased with density. Mussels at higher densities may be feeding on bacteria colonizing pseudofeces or have reduced respiration rates, explaining higher growth rates.

Gravidity, fecundity, and fertilization success of Actinonaias ligamentina were examined at 4 sites along a 63-km reach of the Green River immediately below the Green River Dam, Kentucky. No gravid females were collected at the site closest to the dam, and the percentage of gravid females at downstream sites ranged from 20 to 36\%. Not all females became gravid, despite the presence of early stages of ova in the gonadal fluid. This observation suggests that female A. ligamentina undergo a resting stage and, therefore, might not become gravid every year. Fecundity differed among sites and increased with distance from the dam. Fertilization rates ranged from 32 to 97\% among sites and increased with distance from the dam. Fertilization rate was independent of local mussel density and position in the mussel bed. The high fertilization rates observed in the upstream portions of mussel beds indicate that freshwater mussel sperm have the ability to travel to distant females in lotic systems. Therefore, females are not necessarily dependent upon nearby males for fertilization. Successful fertilization of A. ligamentina at low mussel densities in the Green River suggests that natural recovery of rare endangered species might be possible if host fish and suitable conditions for juvenile survival and growth are present.},

	abstract = {1. The effects of woody debris on stream habitat of juvenile masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) were examined at two spatial scales, stream reach and channel unit, for first- to third-order tributaries of the Teshio River in northern Hokkaido, Japan. The forty-eight study reaches were classified into three distinct types: coarse-substrate step-pool (CSP), coarse-substrate pool-riffle (CPR) and fine-substrate pool-riffle (FPR) reaches. Each reach type included reaches with different riparian settings, broadly classified as forest (relatively undisturbed forest and secondary forest after fires) or grassland (bamboo bushland and pasture).
2. The reach-scale analyses showed that neither total pool volume nor pool-to-pool spacing was correlated with woody debris abundance in any of the three reach types. Masu salmon density was positively correlated with both woody-debris cover area and total cover area, but not with total pool volume in the reaches.
3. Channel-unit-scale analyses revealed that woody debris reduced non-pool velocity, increased pool depth and retained fine sediment in pools in FPR reaches, where the size of woody debris was very large relative to the substrate material size. However, woody debris did not influence any of the hydraulic variables (depth, velocity, substrate) in either non-pools or pools of CSP and CPR reaches. Habitat use by masu salmon in non-pools or pools was affected by woody-debris cover area or total cover area rather than by hydraulic variables in any of the reach types.
4. The effects of woody debris on habitat at the reach- and channel-unit scales in the study area were less than those indicated by previous work in the Pacific Northwest, North America, owing to the relatively small size of the riparian trees. However, the overall results suggested that woody debris in the study area contributed to masu salmon habitat by providing cover at the smaller, microhabitat scale.},

Here we show that female bitterling can significantly improve their fertility with an increase in the number of spawning partners. Females perform conspicuous behaviours associated with spawning more frequently close to sneakers, and spawn more eggs close to high-quality sneakers. This is the first time that females have been shown to engage in behaviour that increases the probability of sneaking, and raises the possibility of a sexual conflict over the number and source of ejaculates during spawning in this species.},

	abstract = {Graph theoretic approaches have received increased interest recently in landscape planning and conservation in the terrestrial realm, because these approaches facilitate the effective modelling of connectivity among habitats. We examined whether basic principles of graph theory can be extended to other ecosystems. Specifically, we demonstrate how a network-based context can be used for enhancing the more effective conservation of riverine systems. We first show how to use graph theoretic techniques to model riverscapes at the segment level. Then we use a real stream network (Zagyva river basin. Hungary) to examine the topological importance of segments in maintaining riverscape connectivity, using betweenness centrality, a commonly used network measure. Using the undirected graph model of this riverscape, we then prioritize segments for conservation purpose. We examine the value of each of the 93 segments present in the Zagyva river basin by considering the conservation value of local fish assemblages, connectivity and the size of the habitat patches. For this purpose we use the 'integral index of connectivity', a recently advocated habitat availability index. Based on the results the selection of the most valuable habitat segments can be optimized depending on conservation resources. Because of their inherent advantage in the consideration of connectivity relationships, we suggest that network analyses offer a simple, yet effective tool for searching for key segments (or junctions) in riverscapes for conservation and environmental management. Further, although the joint consideration of aquatic and terrestrial networks is challenging, the extension of network analyses to freshwater systems may facilitate the more effective selection of priority areas for conservation in continental areas.

We compared three approaches to model the presence-absence of North Island robins in 400 sites among 74 fragments of native forest in a 15,000-ha agricultural landscape in New Zealand. The first approach only considered local habitat characteristics, the second approach only considered metapopulation factors (patch size and isolation), and the third approach combined these two types of factors. The distribution of North Island robins was best predicted by patch isolation, as their probability of occurrence was negatively correlated with isolation from neighbouring patches and from the closest major forests, which probably acted as a source of immigrants. The inclusion of habitat factors gave only a slight increase in predictive power and indicated that robins were more likely to occur in areas with tall canopy, tall understory and low density of young trees. We modelled the effect of isolation using an index of functional patch connectivity based on dispersal behaviour of radio-tracked juveniles, and this functional index greatly improved the models in comparison to classical indices relying on Euclidean distances. This study highlights the need to incorporate functional indices of isolation in presence-absence models in fragmented landscapes, as species occurrence can otherwise be a misleading predictor of habitat quality and lead to wrong interpretations and management recommendations.},

	abstract = {Landscape ecology and metapopulation ecology share a common interest in developing measures that describe the structure of heterogeneous landscapes, but the specific aim in metapopulation ecology is to construct measures that help predict the dynamics of species with information about the structure of fragmented landscapes. The amount of habitat that individuals in a metapopulation have access to can be divided into four components, the amount of habitat in the present habitat parch (A(i)), the amount of connected habitat in other patches available via migration (Gamma(i)), the amount of presented habitat in the present patch after time period Delta t(A(i)'). and the amount of linked habitat in other patches after time period Delta t(Gamma(i)'). Deterministic threshold conditions for metapopulation persistence in patch networks can be approximated with these quantities. For instance, in a version of the Levins model with er;tinction risk proportional to the inverse of patch area and colonization probability proportional to patch connectivity, the threshold condition for metapopulation persistence is given by {\textless}(Gamma A)over bar{\textgreater} +Var(Gamma A)/{\textless}(Gamma A)over bar{\textgreater} {\textgreater} e/c, where e and c are the species-specific extinction and colonization parameters. I conjecture that with measures A' and Gamma' the threshold condition for metapopulation persistence can be extended to dynamic landscapes, in which all or part of population turnover is caused by turnover in the habitat patches themselves. The measures of habitat availability described in this paper can be used to rank dissimilar fragmented landscapes in terms of their capacity to support a viable metapopulation.},

Stable-isotope techniques have recently been used to provide evidence of spatial structure within aquatic food webs. Here, I review current literature on spatial patterns of autochthonous and allochthonous resources in aquatic food webs in lakes and rivers. Across various habitats and ecosystems, the factors determining the major resources of aquatic food webs are primarily phytoplanktonic productivity, benthic algal productivity, and amount of subsidization from terrestrial habitats. Autochthonous and allochthonous resource availability in food webs shifts with gradients in water depth, nutrient concentrations, degree of canopy cover, and distance from terrestrial habitats. Size of lake and river ecosystem (i.e., lake volume and stream width) also affects the relative contribution of the resources to the food webs, as this factor determines the system primary productivity and linkage to terrestrial habitats. Human activities have fragmented river and lake ecosystems and have subsequently modified the structure of aquatic food webs. The responses of food webs to anthropogenic effects differ across ecosystems, and stable isotope techniques can help to quantitatively assess the effects of human impacts on aquatic food webs.},

Fish diet (10 species) was primarily composed of autochthonous items (zooplankton, algae and aquatic insect larvae). Almost all intra-specific diet patterns had moderate to low levels of diet similarity, indicating a high variability in diet. Some species showed no diel patterns in feeding activity, whereas others were primarily diurnal or nocturnal. No differences in feeding activity were observed among habitats of medium and high macrophyte biomasses, and species tended to feed on the same items among these habitats. The most abundant fish species demonstrated low inter-specific diet overlap and appear not to compete for food resources. We suggest that Egeria patches are feeding grounds and shelter for small-sized fish species.},

	volume = {13},
	abstract = {Shallow lakes, the most abundant lake type in the world, are very sensitive to climatic changes. The structure and functioning of shallow lakes are greatly impacted by submerged plants, and these may be affected by climate warming in various, contrasting, ways. Following a space-for-time substitution approach, we aimed to analyse the role of aquatic (submerged and free-floating) plants in shallow lakes under warm climates. We introduced artificial submerged and free-floating plant beds in five comparable lakes located in the temperate zone (Denmark, 55-57 degrees N) and in the subtropical zone (Uruguay, 30-35 degrees S), with the aim to study the structure and dynamics of the main associated communities. Regardless of differences in environmental variables, such as area, water transparency and nutrient status, we found consistent patterns in littoral community dynamics and structure (i.e. densities and composition of fish, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and periphyton) within, but substantial differences between, the two regions. Subtropical fish communities within the macrophyte beds exhibited higher diversity, higher density, smaller size, lower relative abundance of potentially piscivores, and a preference for submerged plants, compared with otherwise similar temperate lakes. By contrast, macroinvertebrates and cladocerans had higher taxon richness and densities, and periphyton higher biomass, in the temperate lakes. Several indicators suggest that the fish predation pressure was much stronger among the plants in the subtropical lakes. The antipredator behaviour of cladocerans also differed significantly between climate zones. Submerged and free-floating plants exerted different effects on the spatial distribution of the main communities, the effects differing between the climate zones. In the temperate lakes, submerged plants promoted trophic interactions with potentially positive cascading effects on water transparency, in contrast to the free-floating plants, and in strong contrast to the findings in the subtropical lakes. The higher impact of fish may result in higher sensitivity of warm lakes to external changes (e.g. increase in nutrient loading or water level changes). The current process of warming, particularly in temperate lakes, may entail an increased sensitivity to eutrophication, and a threat to the high diversity, clear water state.},

Although such waterbodies are found in the natural ranges of two congeneric sunfishes (pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus and bluegill, L. macrochirus), many contain pumpkinseed but no bluegill; a biogeographic pattern that has remained unexplained. To test whether a greater hypoxia tolerance in pumpkinseeds could explain these differences in distribution, we conducted hypoxia tolerance trials by subjecting each species to declining oxygen concentrations over ca. 16 h in aquaria. We also measured the activities of key metabolic enzymes in the muscle of wild individuals. Pumpkinseeds showed significantly higher tolerance to hypoxic stress than bluegills, as indicated by dissolved oxygen concentration at the time of equilibrium loss. Consistent with this result, white muscle from pumpkinseed had higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase, a marker enzyme for anaerobic capacity. There was no difference between species in the activity level of pyruvate kinase, suggesting that pumpkinseed do not display a general upregulation of glycolysis, but rather an upregulation of anaerobic capacity. Our results support the hypothesis that evolved differences in winter hypoxia tolerance can act as a macrohabitat partitioning mechanism in North American sunfishes.},

Temporal patterns in assemblage structure were consistent across the natural estuaries, overprinting complex spatial differences. Nursery ground utilisation and assemblage composition were intimately interlinked. In natural estuaries, assemblage change was a function of changes in both probability of encounter of individual species and in species compositions, and the recruitment, growth and subsequent emigration from the estuaries of juveniles was the main contributor to overall assemblage change. In contrast, in artificial lakes where connectivity with offshore sources of recruits was restricted, species compositions were attenuated and temporal change was not driven by the recruitment of offshore species.},

	abstract = {A topic under intensive study in community ecology and biogeography is the degree to which microscopic, as well as macroscopic organisms, show spatially-structured variation in community characteristics. In general, unicellular microscopic organisms are regarded as ubiquitously distributed and, therefore, without a clear biogeographic signal. This view was summarized 75 years ago by Baas-Becking, who stated "everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects". Within the context of metacommunity theory, this hypothesis is congruent with the species sorting model. By using a broad-scale dataset on stream diatom communities and environmental predictor variables across most of Finland, our main aim was to test this hypothesis. Patterns of spatial autocorrelation were evaluated by Moran's I based correlograms, whereas partial regression analysis and partial redundancy analysis were used to quantify the relative importance of environmental and spatial factors on total species richness and on community composition, respectively. Significant patterns of spatial autocorrelation were found for all environmental variables, which also varied widely. Our main results were clear-cut. In general, pure spatial effects clearly overcame those of environmental effects, with the former explaining much more variation in species richness and community composition. Most likely, missing environmental variables cannot explain the higher predictive power of spatial variables, because we measured key factors that have previously been found to be the most important variables (e.g. pH, conductivity, colour, phosphorus, nitrogen) shaping the structure of diatom communities. Therefore, our results provided only limited support for the Baas-Becking hypothesis and the species sorting perspective of metacommunity theory.},

	abstract = {Recognition and analysis of spatial autocorrelation has defined a new paradigm in ecology. Attention to spatial pattern can lead to insights that would have been otherwise overlooked, while ignoring space may lead to false conclusions about ecological relationships. We used Gaussian spatial autoregressive models, fit with widely available software, to examine breeding habitat relationships for three common Neotropical migrant songbirds in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee, USA. In preliminary models that ignored space, the abundance of all three species was correlated with both local- and landscape-scale habitat variables. These models were then modified to account for broadscale spatial trend (via trend surface analysis) and fine-scale autocorrelation (via an autoregressive spatial covariance matrix). Residuals from ordinary least squares regression models were autocorrelated, indicating that the assumption of independent errors was violated. In contrast, residuals from autoregressive models showed little spatial pattern, suggesting that these models were appropriate. The magnitude of habitat effects tended to decrease, and the relative importance of different habitat variables shifted when we incorporated broadscale and then fine-scale space into the analysis. The degree to which habitat effects changed when space was added to the models was roughly correlated with the amount of spatial structure in the habitat variables. Spatial pattern in the residuals from ordinary least squares models may result from failure to include or adequately measure autocorrelated habitat variables. In addition, contagious processes, such as conspecific attraction, may generate spatial patterns in species abundance that cannot be explained by habitat models. For our study species, spatial patterns in the ordinary least squares residuals suggest that a scale of 500-1000 m would be appropriate for investigating possible contagious processes.},

We examined the effects of inbreeding across the full life-history continuum, from survival up to adulthood, to subsequent reproductive success, and to the recruitment of second-generation offspring, in wild Takahe (Porphyrio hochstetteri) by analyzing pedigree and fitness data collected over 21 breeding seasons. Although the effect size of inbreeding at individual life-history stages was small, inbreeding depression accumulated across multiple life-history stages and ultimately reduced long-term fitness (i.e., successful recruitment of second-generation offspring). The estimated total lethal equivalents (2B) summed across all life-history stages were substantial (16.05, 95\% CI 0.08-90.8) and equivalent to an 88\% reduction in recruitment of second-generation offspring for closely related pairs (e.g., sib-sib pairings) relative to unrelated pairs (according to the pedigree). A history of small population size in the Takahe could have contributed to partial purging of the genetic load and the low level of inbreeding depression detected at each single life-history stage. Nevertheless, our results indicate that such "purged" populations can still exhibit substantial inbreeding depression, especially when small but negative fitness effects accumulate across the species' life history. Because inbreeding depression can ultimately affect population viability of small, isolated populations, our results illustrate the importance of measuring the effects of inbreeding across the full life-history continuum.},

	abstract = {Invasion by mats of free-floating plants is among the most important threats to the functioning and biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems ranging from temperate ponds and ditches to tropical lakes. Dark, anoxic conditions under thick floating-plant cover leave little opportunity for animal or plant life, and they can have large negative impacts on fisheries and navigation in tropical lakes. Here, we demonstrate that floating-plant dominance can be a self-stabilizing ecosystem state, which may explain its notorious persistence in many situations. Our results, based on experiments, field data, and models, represent evidence for alternative domains of attraction in ecosystems. An implication of our findings is that nutrient enrichment reduces the resilience of freshwater systems against a shift to floating-plant dominance. On the other hand, our results also suggest that a single drastic harvest of floating plants can induce a permanent shift to an alternative state dominated by rooted, submerged growth forms.},

	abstract = {Geographic variation in species richness has been explained by different theories such as energy, productivity, energy-water balance, habitat heterogeneity, and freezing tolerance. This Study determines which of these theories best account for gradients of breeding bird richness in China. In addition, we develop a best-fit model to account for the relationship between breeding bird richness and environment in China. Breeding bird species richness in 207 localities (3271 km(2) per locality on average) from across China was related to thirteen environmental variables after accounting for sampling area. The Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was used to evaluate model performance. We used Moran's I to determine the magnitude of spatial autocorrelation in model residuals, and used simultaneous autoregressive model to determine coefficients of determination and AIC of explanatory variables after accounting for residual spatial autocorrelation. Of all environmental variables examined, normalized difference vegetation index, a measure Of plant productivity, is the best variable to explain the variance in breeding bird richness. We found that species richness of breeding birds at the scale examined is best predicted by a combination of plant productivity, elevation range, seasonal variation in potential evapotranspiration, and mean annual temperature. These variables explained 47.3\% of the variance in breeding bird richness after accounting for sampling area; most of the explained variance in richness is attributable to the first two of the four variables.

	volume = {55},
	abstract = {1. Analyses of species association have major implications for selecting indicators for freshwater biomonitoring and conservation, because they allow for the elimination of redundant information and focus on taxa that can be easily handled and identified. These analyses are particularly relevant in the debate about using speciose groups (such as the Chironomidae) as indicators in the tropics, because they require difficult and time-consuming analysis, and their responses to environmental gradients, including anthropogenic stressors, are poorly known. 2. Our objective was to show whether chironomid assemblages in Neotropical streams include clear associations of taxa and, if so, how well these associations could be explained by a set of models containing information from different spatial scales. For this, we formulated a priori models that allowed for the influence of local, landscape and spatial factors on chironomid taxon associations (CTA). These models represented biological hypotheses capable of explaining associations between chironomid taxa. For instance, CTA could be best explained by local variables (e.g. pH, conductivity and water temperature) or by processes acting at wider landscape scales (e.g. percentage of forest cover). 3. Biological data were taken from 61 streams in Southeastern Brazil, 47 of which were in well-preserved regions, and 14 of which drained areas severely affected by anthropogenic activities. We adopted a model selection procedure using Akaike's information criterion to determine the most parsimonious models for explaining CTA. 4. Applying Kendall's coefficient of concordance, seven genera (Tanytarsus/Caladomyia, Ablabesmyia, Parametriocnemus, Pentaneura, Nanocladius, Polypedilum and Rheotanytarsus) were identified as associated taxa. The best-supported model explained 42.6\% of the total variance in the abundance of associated taxa. This model combined local and landscape environmental filters and spatial variables (which were derived from eigenfunction analysis). However, the model with local filters and spatial variables also had a good chance of being selected as the best model. 5. Standardised partial regression coefficients of local and landscape filters, including spatial variables, derived from model averaging allowed an estimation of which variables were best correlated with the abundance of associated taxa. In general, the abundance of the associated genera tended to be lower in streams characterised by a high percentage of forest cover (landscape scale), lower proportion of muddy substrata and high values of pH and conductivity (local scale). 6. Overall, our main result adds to the increasing number of studies that have indicated the importance of local and landscape variables, as well as the spatial relationships among sampling sites, for explaining aquatic insect community patterns in streams. Furthermore, our findings open new possibilities for the elimination of redundant data in the assessment of anthropogenic impacts on tropical streams.},

Despite the enormous attention given to SAR in the form of many individual analyses, little attempt has been made to synthesize these studies. We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis of 794 SAR, comprising a wide span of organisms, habitats and locations. We identified factors reflecting both pattern-based and dynamic approaches to SAR and tested whether these factors leave significant imprints on the slope and strength of SAR. Our analysis revealed that SAR are significantly affected by variables characterizing the sampling scheme, the spatial scale, and the types of organisms or habitats involved. We found that steeper SAR are generated at lower latitudes and by larger organisms. SAR varied significantly between nested and independent sampling schemes and between major ecosystem types, but not generally between the terrestrial and the aquatic realm. Both the fit and the slope of the SAR were scale-dependent. We conclude that factors dynamically regulating species richness at different spatial scales strongly affect the shape of SAR. We highlight important consequences of this systematic variation in SAR for ecological theory, conservation management and extinction risk predictions.},

	volume = {98},
	abstract = {1. Many plant species are currently experiencing negative consequences of habitat fragmentation as a result of reductions in population size and disruptions in pollination services. Plants in specialized pollination systems might be especially vulnerable to changes in plant population size and density resulting from land-use changes. 2. Representing such a system, we chose the globeflower Trollius europaeus L. with its pollinating fly Chiastocheta, which also acts as a seed predator at its larval stage, to investigate the effects of small plant population size on reproductive success and pollinator abundance. 3. Reproductive output of T. europaeus declined with increasing plant population size, while Chiastocheta abundance within T. europaeus flowers was independent of plant population size. However, at the local level, Chiastocheta numbers within flowers were inversely correlated to local T. europaeus flower density. We further found that increasing floral densities increased plant reproductive success at the population level. 4. Chiastocheta abundance was the main driver of reproductive output of T. europaeus through its dual role as an obligate pollinator and seed predator: at least some Chiastocheta flies were needed to secure pollination, but a continued increase in Chiastocheta flies within a flower incurred seed predation costs that greatly reduced reproductive success. Thus, high local flower density contributed positively to per capita reproductive output by diluting Chiastocheta abundance within flowers independently of overall population size. 5. Synthesis. Our findings highlight that plant population size is not always the main determinant of reproductive success for populations, but that other factors such as plant density and the specific ecology of a pollinator and its interplay with other population parameters can be more important in determining the fate of a population. Furthermore, the effects of plant population size and floral density on pollinator visitation in T. europaeus vary across scales, with implications for plant fitness. It is therefore important not to focus solely on pure plant population size in determining population viability. Thus, from a conservation perspective, even small and isolated T. europaeus populations may be viable and resistant to pollination-associated vulnerabilities depending on plant density at local (subpopulation) scales.},

	abstract = {1. The change in fish fauna was monitored in ponds within irrigation systems in Iwate prefecture, north-eastern Japan to evaluate the effectiveness of eradicating the invasive piscivorous largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides. 2. Eleven study ponds were categorized into three pond groups: bass-dwelling (n = 3), bass-eradicated (n = 3) and non-invaded ponds (n = 5). 3. Species richness and diversity, which temporally decreased in bass-dwelling ponds, increased in bass-eradicated ponds. Furthermore, in bass-eradicated ponds, the mean numbers of topmouth minnow and freshwater goby were gradually restored, but in bass-dwelling ponds the numbers decreased and both species eventually disappeared. 4. Although the eradication of piscivorous invaders is helpful for restoring fish species diversity in ponds, its effectiveness varies among species, and other alien fish such as the rose bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus ocellatus) often invade and proliferate in the bass-eradicated ponds. 5. To ensure successful restoration of native biota and avoid undesirable results, it is necessary to plan and implement continuous monitoring and adaptive management after eradication of alien predators.

In an attempt to redress some of these issues and outline an approach for further studies, three categories of terrestrial insect indicators, corresponding to differences in their application, are proposed, i.e. environmental, ecological and biodiversity indicators. The procedures in terrestrial insect bioindicator studies should start with a clear definition of the study objectives and proposed use of the bioindicator, as well as with a consideration of the scale at which the study is to be carried out. Bioindication studies are conducted at a variety of spatial and temporal scales within the context of earth-system processes, but the objectives of the study will largely determine the scale at which it would be optimally conducted. There is a tendency for studies to be conducted below their space-time scaling functions, giving them apparent predictability. The selection of potential indicator taxa or groups is then based on a priori suitability criteria, the identification of predictive relationships between the indicator and environmental variables and, most importantly, the development and testing of hypotheses according to the correlative patterns found. Finally, recommendations for the use of the indicator in monitoring should be made. Although advocating rigorous, long-term protocols to identify indicators may presently be questionable in the face of the urgency with which conservation decisions have to be made, this approach is critical if bioindicators are to be used with any measurable degree of confidence.},

Worldwide rate of extinction of freshwater bivalves is poorly understood at this time. The North American freshwater fauna north of Mexico is represented by 297 taxa in two families. There are 19 taxa presumed extinct, 44 species listed or proposed as federally endangered, and there are another 69 species that may be endangered. A number of these endangered species are functionally extinct (individuals of a species surviving but not reproducing), Extinction of North American unionoid bivalves can be traced to impoundment and inundation of riffle habitat in major rivers such as the Ohio, Tennessee and Cumberland and Mobile Bay Basin. Damming resulted in the local loss of the bivalves' host fish. This loss of the obligate host fish, coupled with increased siltation, and various types of industrial and domestic pollution have resulted in the rapid decline in the unionoid bivalve fauna in North America. Freshwater communities in Europe have experienced numerous problems, some local unionoid populations have been extirpated, but no unionoid species are extinct. Three taxa from Israel are now reported as extinct. Other nations such as China that have problems with soil erosion and industrial pollution or have numerous dams on some of the rivers (e.g., South America: Rio Parana) are probably experiencing problems of local extirpation if not the extinction of their endemic freshwater bivalve fauna.},

A study was undertaken in order to assess the impact of this event on a large, internationally important Freshwater pearl mussel (Margauitifera margaritifera L.) population. A conservative estimate of 50,000 mussels killed by the flood was made. This represents 4-8\% of the total population. Significant channel reformation and large-scale movements of substrata occurred in some reaches, whereas others appeared to be unchanged. Some mussel beds disappeared or were largely depleted whereas others remained intact. Boulder-dominated substrata appear to have provided the most protection from scouring. The relatively high mussel densities and recruitment levels found in the middle reaches are probably due to the fact that this part of the river is hydrologically stable. It is likely that the intact mussel beds in the middle reaches will be the main source of regeneration in other parts of the river as the population recovers. As a result of recent changes in the hydrological behaviour of Scottish rivers, several M. margaritifera populations may now be more at risk from these catastrophic events. Therefore, it is important that conservation managers are aware of this potential threat. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Rigorous and widely applicable indicators of biodiversity are needed to monitor the responses of ecosystems to global change and design effective conservation schemes. Among the potential indicators of biodiversity, those based on the functional traits of species and communities are interesting because they can be generalized to similar habitats and can be assessed by relatively rapid field assessment across eco-regions. Functional traits, however, have as yet been rarely considered in current common monitoring schemes. Moreover, standardized procedures of trait measurement and analyses have almost exclusively been developed for plants but different approaches have been used for different groups of organisms. Here we review approaches using functional traits as biodiversity indicators focussing not on plants as usual but particularly on animal groups that are commonly considered in different biodiversity monitoring schemes (benthic invertebrates, collembolans, above ground insects and birds). Further, we introduce a new framework based on functional traits indices and illustrate it using case studies where the traits of these organisms can help monitoring the response of biodiversity to different land use change drivers. We propose and test standard procedures to integrate different components of functional traits into biodiversity monitoring schemes across trophic levels and disciplines. We suggest that the development of indicators using functional traits could complement, rather than replace, the existent biodiversity monitoring. In this way, the comparison of the effect of land use changes on biodiversity is facilitated and is expected to positively influence conservation management practices.},

	volume = {23},
	abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that variation in the sensitivity of animals to habitat change is explained by ecological traits (life-history traits, trophic level, and mobility). We measured the sensitivity of insectivorous mammals (shrews and bats) and their prey (arthropods active at the soil surface and nocturnal aerial arthropods) to three aspects of agricultural intensification in a matched-pair experimental design: increased use of agrochemicals (comparison of organic and conventional cereal crops, with pairing for the size of the boundary hedge), change in grassland management from hay to silage (with pairing for the size of the boundary hedge), and increased field size due to hedgerow loss (with boundary-field comparisons as a proxy). We assessed the sensitivity of taxa as the difference in their relative abundance between pairs of high- and low-intensity sites for each aspect of agricultural intensification. We used phylogenetically informed analyses to explore cross-species relationships between our measures of sensitivity and seven ecological traits of animals (e.g., trophic level, mobility, and reproductive rate). Several traits were related to the sensitivity of animals to agricultural intensification. These traits were mainly associated with fast life histories (high reproductive output and low trophic level) and low mobility. Trophic level of adults was related to sensitivity to habitat change for all three aspects of agricultural intensification, but the direction of the relationship differed between the three aspects of intensification. The significance of the relationship between other ecological traits and sensitivity to intensification varied for the three aspects of agricultural intensification. Our results show that some ecological traits can be used to preselect taxa that are predicted to be sensitive to habitat change, and their sensitivity can be tested empirically for use as biotic indicator taxa. Understanding which traits are related to sensitivity to habitat change is vital because sensitivity is important in determining a taxon's ability to survive in dynamic environments.},

	volume = {132},
	abstract = {The use of indicator taxa for conservation planning is common, despite inconsistent evidence regarding their effectiveness. These inconsistencies may be the result of differences among species and taxonomic groups studied, geographic location, or scale of analysis. The scale of analysis can be defined by grain and extent, which are often confounded. Grain is the size of each observational unit and extent is the size of the entire study area. Using species occurrence records compiled by NatureServe from survey data, range maps, and expert opinion, we examined correlations in species richness between each of seven taxa (amphibians, birds, butterflies, freshwater fish, mammals, freshwater mussels, and reptiles) and total richness of the remaining six taxa at varying grains and extents in two regions of the US (Mid-Atlantic and Pacific Northwest). We examined four different spatial units of interest: hexagon (similar to 649 km(2)), subecoregion (3800-34,000 km(2)), ecoregion (8300 - 79,000 km(2)), and geographic region (315,000-426,000 km(2)). We analyzed the correlations with varying extent of analysis (grain held constant at the hexagon) and varying grain (extent held constant at the region). The strength of correlation among taxa was context dependent, varying widely with grain, extent, region, and taxon. This suggests that (1) taxon, grain, extent, and study location explain, in part, inconsistent results of previous studies; (2) planning based on indicator relationships developed at other grains or extents should be undertaken cautiously; and (3) planning based on indicator relationships developed in other geographic locations is risky, even if planning occurs at an equivalent grain and extent.

As filter feeding grazers, mussels can remove large amounts of particulate matter from the water column and transfer these resources to the substrate as biodeposits (agglutinated mussel faeces and pseudofaeces). Mussel biodeposits are a nutrient rich and easily assimilated food source and therefore may have significant relevance to benthic community structure. This study examines the functional role of Margaritifera falcata in the South Fork Eel River, California. 2. We addressed two main questions: (i) Do mussels increase benthic resources in this system? (ii) If so, does this alter macroinvertebrate community structure? 3. Measurements and enclosure experiments in the South Fork Eel River show that mussels can play a significant role in local food webs by increasing available fine particulate matter (both organic and inorganic) on the substrate. We document increased benthic macroinvertebrate biomass for predators and collectors (Leptophlebidae) in the presence of mussels, but only in late summer.},

	abstract = {Freshwater mussels are long-lived and relatively stationary organisms that form annual rings, so they provide excellent opportunities for studying how population properties such as age structure relate to environmental influences on recruitment and mortality. We investigated population dynamics of the freshwater pearl mussel, Margaritifera falcata, in 2 northern California Coast Range rivers, the South Fork Eel and the Navarro. We used field observations and inverse theoretical modeling to assess age structures and identify factors that control population demographics. Distinctly different mortality rates for young ({\textless} 20 y) and old ({\textgreater}= 20 y) mussels were observed in the South Fork Eel, and recruitment and mortality both were related to river discharge regimes. Margaritifera falcata recruited more successfully during low-discharge than during high-discharge years, and a 2-fold increase in discharge caused a 60\% decline in recruitment success. Active annual recruitment (similar to 1100-1800 ind./y) was observed in the South Fork Eel, whereas recruitment has been low or nonexistent during the past 30 y in the Navarro. This difference probably is a consequence of the influence of 2 non-mutually exclusive factors: landuse history and host-fish abundance. The Navarro watershed has extensive timber harvesting and orchard/vineyard agriculture and has had severe declines in fish populations, whereas large sections of the South Fork Eel pass through protected land and the river has retained its historical fish populations. Investigation of the factors that shape local M. falcata population age structures yielded insights into the influence of environmental variables and history on mortality and recruitment that will aid conservation of this endangered family.},

Mussel populations in the Neversink are dense (mean = 3.2/m2) and highly clumped. Stepwise discriminant analyses showed that current speed and spatial variation in current speed were the most useful predictors of the occurrence of mussels in quadrats. Alasmidonta heterodon was found most frequently at moderate current speeds and in quadrats that contained many patches of fine sediments. Alasmidonta varicosa occurred mort frequently at moderate current speeds and in sediments with a high proportion of medium sands (0.25-1 mm). Nevertheless, the predictive power of discriminant models based on microhabitat variables is ro low that we question the adequacy of a traditional microhabitat approach to unionacean ecology. We suggest that including geomorphological descriptors of the streambed or working at spatial scales of hundreds of metres might be more useful than a traditional microhabitat approach for predicting the distribution of freshwater mussels in streams.},

	volume = {142},
	abstract = {Hedgerows have been proposed as habitat and conservation corridor for forest plant species, but their importance for the survival of these species is still not clear. The objective of our study was to examine the frequency of occurrence of forest species and total forest species richness in different parts of the hedgerows, and to relate these patterns of occurrence to the species' habitat requirements and life history traits. We surveyed in total 130 forest-hedgerow transects in North-western Germany, including three age classes. About 77\% of all forest plant species (including some endangered taxa) occurring in the neighbouring forests were also found in the adjacent hedgerows. In all age classes, there was a negative relationship between distance from the forest-hedgerow ecotone and the number of species. Ancient hedgerows were not significantly more species-rich than more recent ones. Within 100 m distance from the forest edge, forest species richness increased with an increasing number of species in the nearby forest and with an increasing cover of the tree canopy as well as a decreasing cover of the shrub layer. Species with high frequency had comparatively high Ellenberg indicator values for light, and were mostly associated with anemochorous and epizoochorous seed dispersal. The frequency of occurrence in hedgerows of species with common attributes was partly in agreement, partly in disagreement with the results obtained in previous studies. We conclude that patterns are difficult to generalize, probably due to a strong regional variation in the pool of forest species and in the specific environments of both forests and hedgerows.

	abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. There is general concern that local loss of plant diversity will adversely impact net primary productivity and other ecosystem properties. However, mechanisms linking plant diversity with other trophic levels, especially for large herbivores, are poorly understood. 2. We examine the responses of foraging sheep to changes in plant species richness in an indoor cafeteria experiment involving six plant species richness levels (1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 11 species) and three plant functional group compositions within each level, and in a field experiment involving three plant species richness levels (1, 4-6 or {\textgreater} 8 species). 3. Sheep preferred a diverse diet over a single diet even when palatable species were in the diet. Voluntary daily intake steadily rose with increases in plant species richness in both cafeteria and field experiments. The overall nutrient intake (i.e. daily energy and protein intakes) of sheep in the cafeteria also rose significantly with increased plant species richness until it reached a plateau at eight species. The quality of the diet selected by sheep was also significantly affected by plant species richness, but the variation of dietary quality was small and variable. 4. High nutrient acquisition by the sheep depended on selecting those palatable species with high nutrient content from the plant forage on offer together with the complementary effects of plant species richness, especially for plant functional group richness. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our experiments demonstrate an asymptotic relationship between plant species richness and voluntary intake by sheep. Increases in plant species richness from a low level led to increased daily nutrient intake, and presumably performance of the sheep. Natural grasslands are generally low in nutritional quality and so plant species richness will critically influence herbivore food intake and nutrition. The asymptotic relationship indicates that the maintenance of plant species richness in rangelands will benefit both domestic herbivore production and the conservation of biodiversity.},

Although unrelated to spatial aggregation, the number of ova carried by mussels varied with body size in a manner that suggests extremely late maturation followed by reproductive senescence in the largest mussels. Egg production was 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than that of other poikilotherms of equivalent mass. Fertilization success was strongly correlated with spatial aggregation, with complete fertilization failure found at local densities of {\textless} 10 mussels/m2, {\textgreater} 50\% successful when local densities were {\textgreater} 18 mussels/m2, and 100\% successful only in patches where local densities exceeded 40 mussels/m2.

Moreover, the mean glochidial load on trout (Salmo trutta), which was positively related to adult mussel density, did not differ significantly between these stream types. Thus, the larval stages of the freshwater pearl mussel were not related to recruitment failure. Instead, recruitment is probably hindered at the next stage in the life history of the mussels, the benthic stage, and may be related to sedimentation as turbidity was four times greater in streams lacking recent recruitment than in streams with recent recruitment. Furthermore, we found that juvenile mussel density was positively related to the number of glochidial infections per stream area in streams with ongoing recruitment, indicating that successful recruitment in these streams may depend on both mussel and trout density. Future research should thus examine biotic interactions between mussels and trout as well as the effects of sedimentation on benthic-living mussels. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Yet lobate ctenophores can capture prey at rates comparable to sophisticated predatory copepods and fish, and they are capable of altering the composition of coastal planktonic communities. Here, we demonstrate that the predatory success of the lobate ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi lies in its use of cilia to generate a feeding current that continuously entrains large volumes of fluid, yet is virtually undetectable to its prey. This form of stealth predation enables M. leidyi to feed as a generalist predator capturing prey, including microplankton (approximately 50 mu m), copepods (approximately 1 mm), and fish larvae ({\textgreater} 3 mm). The efficacy and versatility of this stealth feeding mechanism has enabled M. leidyi to be notoriously destructive as a predator and successful as an invasive species.},

	abstract = {Ecologists would like to explain general patterns observed across multi-species communities, such as species-area(1) and abundance-frequency relationships(1-4), in terms of the fundamental processes of birth, death and migration underlying the dynamics of all constituent species. The unified neutral theory of biodiversity(5,6) and related theories(7,8) based on these fundamental population processes have successfully recreated general species-abundance patterns without accounting for either the variation among species and individuals or resource-releasing processes such as predation and disturbance, long emphasized in ecological theory(9-14). If ecological communities can be described adequately without estimating variation in species and their interactions(15), our understanding of ecological community organization and the predicted consequences of reduced biodiversity and environmental change would shift markedly. Here, I introduce a strong method to test the neutral theory that combines field parameterization of the underlying population dynamics with a field experiment, and apply it to a rocky intertidal community. Although the observed abundance-frequency distribution of the system follows that predicted by the neutral theory, the neutral theory predicts poorly the field experimental results, indicating an essential role for variation in species interactions.},

	abstract = {We studied the reproduction and shell size structure of the endangered dwarf wedge-mussel (Alasmidonta heterodon) in the Mill River, Massachusetts, at sites of different mussel abundance, and assessed the dispersal capacity of its host fish, the tessellated darter (Etheostoma olmstedi). We quantified 4 phases of reproduction at 5 study sites of contrasting adult mussel abundance (3 low-abundance sites, 1 intermediate, 1 high), including gravidity, glochidial release, host infection rate, and juvenile recruitment. The ratio of gravid to nongravid individuals was higher at the high-abundance site, and comparatively lower at the intermediate- and low-abundance sites. Glochidial release, infection rates on host darters, and juvenile recruitment were directly proportional to mussel abundance. The highest glochidia density (0.12/m(3)) occurred at the high-abundance site. Mean infection rates during early May to late June ranged from 31\% at the high-abundance site to 8\% at the intermediate- and 0 to 2\% at the 3 low-abundance sites. The high-abundance site showed highest level of juvenile recruitment. Low-abundance sites showed narrow ranges of size classes, probably indicating few year classes. Movement by marked darters was minimal during glochidial release, with 94\% of marked darters remaining in locations where they were originally marked. Reproduction by A. heterodon in the Mill River depends on mussel patch density, and mussel dispersal by the host fish may be limited to the immediate vicinity of the infection site. Such a low dispersal capacity may lead to a patchy mussel distribution and may hinder colonization and recovery of this species.},

	title = {Competition-defense tradeoffs and the maintenance of plant diversity},
	volume = {107},
	abstract = {Ecologists have long observed that consumers can maintain species diversity in communities of their prey. Many theories of how consumers mediate diversity invoke a tradeoff between species' competitive ability and their ability to withstand predation. Under this constraint, the best competitors are also most susceptible to consumers, preventing them from excluding other species. However, empirical evidence for competition-defense tradeoffs is limited and, as such, the mechanisms by which consumers regulate diversity remain uncertain. We performed a meta-analysis of 36 studies to evaluate the prevalence of the competition-defense tradeoff and its role in maintaining diversity in plant communities. We quantified species' responses to experimental resource addition and consumer removal as estimates of competitive ability and resistance to consumers, respectively. With this analysis, we found mixed empirical evidence for a competition-defense tradeoff; in fact, competitive ability tended to be weakly positively correlated with defense overall. However, when present, negative relationships between competitive ability and defense influenced species diversity in the manner predicted by theory. In the minority of communities for which a tradeoff was detected, species evenness was higher, and resource addition and consumer removal reduced diversity. Our analysis reframes the commonly held notion that consumers structure plant communities through a competition-defense tradeoff. Such a tradeoff can maintain diversity when present, but negative correlations between competitive ability and defense were less common than is often assumed. In this respect, this study supports an emerging theoretical paradigm in which predation interacts with competition to both enhance and reduce species diversity.},

	abstract = {Great effort continues to focus on ecosystem restoration and reduction of nutrient inputs thought to be responsible, in part, for declines in estuary habitats worldwide. The ability of environmental policy to address restoration is limited, in part, by uncertainty in the relationships between costly restoration and benefits. Here, we present results from an 18-y field investigation (1990-2007) of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) community dynamics and water quality in the Potomac River, a major tributary of the Chesapeake Bay. River and anthropogenic discharges lower water clarity by introducing nutrients that stimulate phytoplankton and epiphyte growth as well as suspended sediments. Efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay are often viewed as failing. Overall nutrient reduction and SAV restoration goals have not been met. In the Potomac River, however, reduced in situ nutrients, wastewater-treatment effluent nitrogen, and total suspended solids were significantly correlated to increased SAV abundance and diversity. Species composition and relative abundance also correlated with nutrient and water-quality conditions, indicating declining fitness of exotic species relative to native species during restoration. Our results suggest that environmental policies that reduce anthropogenic nutrient inputs do result in improved habitat quality, with increased diversity and native species abundances. The results also help elucidate why SAV cover has improved only in some areas of the Chesapeake Bay.},

	abstract = {1. Populations in different locations can exchange individuals depending on the distribution and connectivity of suitable habitat, and the dispersal capabilities and behaviour of the organisms. We used an isotopic tracer, N-15, to label stoneflies ( Leuctra ferruginea) to determine the extent of adult flight along stream corridors and between streams where their larvae live. 2. In four mass, mark- capture experiments we added (NH4Cl)-N-15 continuously for several weeks to label specific regions of streams within the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH, U. S. A. We collected adult stoneflies along the labelled streams ( up to 1.5 km of stream length), on transects through the forest away from labelled sections ( up to 500 m), and along an 800- m reach of adjacent tributary that flows into a labelled stream. 3. Of 966 individual adult stoneflies collected and analysed for N-15, 20\% were labelled. Most labelled stoneflies were captured along stream corridors and had flown upstream a mean distance of 211 m; the net movement of the population ( upstream + downstream) estimated from the midpoint of the labelled sections was 126 m upstream. The furthest male and female travelled approximately 730 m and approximately 663 m upstream, respectively. We also captured labelled mature females along an unlabelled tributary and along a forest transect 500 m from the labelled stream, thus demonstrating crosswatershed dispersal. 4. We conclude that the adjacent forest was not a barrier to dispersal between catchments, and adult dispersal linked stonefly populations among streams across a landscape within one generation. Our data on the extent of adult dispersal provide a basis for a conceptual model identifying the boundaries of these populations, whose larvae are restricted to stream channels, and whose females must return to streams to oviposit.},

First, plant soil feedback interactions in the invaded range are neutral to positive, whereas native plants predominantly suffer from negative soil feedback effects. Second, exotic plants can manipulate local soil biota by enhancing pathogen levels or disrupting communities of root symbionts, while suffering less from this than native plants. Third, exotic plants produce allelochemicals toxic to native plants that cannot be detoxified by local soil communities, or that become more toxic following microbial conversion. We discuss the need for integrating these three pathways in order to further understand how soil communities influence exotic plant invasions.},

	abstract = {The addition of large water storage dams to rivers in California's Central Valley blocked access to spawning habitat and has resulted in a dramatic decline in the distribution and abundance of spring-run chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum 1792). Successful recovery efforts depend on an understanding of the historical spatial structure of these populations, which heretofore has been lacking. Graph theory was used to examine the spatial structure and demographic connectivity of riverine populations of spring-run chinook salmon. Standard graph theoretic measures, including degree, edge weight and node strength, were used to uncover the role of individual populations in this network, i.e. which populations were sources and which were pseudo-sinks. Larger spatially proximate populations, most notably the Pit River, served as sources in the historic graph. These source populations in the graph were marked by an increased number of stronger outbound connections (edges), and on average had few inbound connections. Of the edges in the current graph, seven of them were outbound from a population supported by a hatchery in the Feather River, which suggests a strong influence of the hatchery on the structure of the current extant populations. We tested how the addition of water storage dams fragmented the graph over time by examining changing patterns in connectivity and demographic isolation of individual populations. Dams constructed in larger spatially proximate populations had a strong impact on the independence of remaining populations. Specifically, the addition of dams resulted in lost connections, weaker remaining connections and an increase in demographic isolation. A simulation exercise that removed populations from the graph under different removal scenarios - random removal, removal by decreasing habitat size and removal by decreasing node strength - revealed a potential approach for restoration of these depleted populations. Synthesis and applications. Spatial graphs are drawing the attention of ecologists and managers. Here we have used a directed graph to uncover the historical spatial structure of a threatened species, estimate the connectivity of the current populations, examine how the historical network of populations was fragmented over time and provide a plausible mechanism for ecologically successful restoration. The methods employed here can be applied broadly across taxa and systems, and afford scientists and managers a better understanding of the structure and function of impaired ecosystems.},

	abstract = {A central question in ecology with great importance for management, conservation and biological control is how changing connectivity affects the persistence and dynamics of interacting species. Researchers in many disciplines have used large systems of coupled oscillators to model the behaviour of a diverse array of fluctuating systems in nature(1-4). In the well- studied regime of weak coupling, synchronization is favoured by increases in coupling strength and large- scale network structures ( for example 'small worlds') that produce short cuts and clustering(5-9). Here we show that, by contrast, randomizing the structure of dispersal networks in a model of predators and prey tends to favour asynchrony and prolonged transient dynamics, with resulting effects on the amplitudes of population fluctuations. Our results focus on synchronization and dynamics of clusters in models, and on time-scales, more appropriate for ecology, namely smaller systems with strong interactions outside the weak- coupling regime, rather than the better- studied cases of large, weakly coupled systems. In these smaller systems, the dynamics of transients and the effects of changes in connectivity can be well understood using a set of methods including numerical reconstructions of phase dynamics, examinations of cluster formation and the consideration of important aspects of cyclic dynamics, such as amplitude.},

	volume = {55},
	abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. In this review, we first summarize how hydrologic connectivity has been studied for riverine fish capable of moving long distances, and then identify research opportunities that have clear conservation significance. Migratory species, such as anadromous salmonids, are good model organisms for understanding ecological connectivity in rivers because the spatial scale over which movements occur among freshwater habitats is large enough to be easily observed with available techniques; they are often economically or culturally valuable with habitats that can be easily fragmented by human activities; and they integrate landscape conditions from multiple surrounding catchment(s) with in-river conditions. Studies have focussed on three themes: (i) relatively stable connections (connections controlled by processes that act over broad spatio-temporal scales {\textgreater} 1000 km2 and {\textgreater} 100 years); (ii) dynamic connections (connections controlled by processes acting over fine to moderate spatio-temporal scales similar to 1-1000 km2 and {\textless} 1-100 years); and (iii) anthropogenic influences on hydrologic connectivity, including actions that disrupt or enhance natural connections experienced by fish. 2. We outline eight challenges to understanding the role of connectivity in riverine fish ecology, organized under three foci: (i) addressing the constraints of river structure; (ii) embracing temporal complexity in hydrologic connectivity; and (iii) managing connectivity for riverine fishes. Challenges include the spatial structure of stream networks, the force and direction of flow, scale-dependence of connectivity, shifting boundaries, complexity of behaviour and life histories and quantifying anthropogenic influence on connectivity and aligning management goals. As we discuss each challenge, we summarize relevant approaches in the literature and provide additional suggestions for improving research and management of connectivity for riverine fishes. 3. Specifically, we suggest that rapid advances are possible in the following arenas: (i) incorporating network structure and river discharge into analyses; (ii) increasing explicit consideration of temporal complexity and fish behaviour in the scope of analyses; and (iii) parsing degrees of human and natural influences on connectivity and defining acceptable alterations. Multiscale analyses are most likely to identify dominant patterns of connections and disconnections, and the appropriate scale at which to focus conservation activities.},

Conservation strategies for endangered freshwater molluscs and for salmonid fishes have been proposed but they are typically poorly integrated. Here, we examined for the first time the genetic structure of a critically endangered obligate mollusc invertebrate parasite, the freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera), and its vertebrate host fish, the brown trout (Salmo trutta m. fario), in European headwater streams. We compared genetic differentiation and diversity with productivity and ecological habitat features of both species in nine different European streams from the drainage systems of the Danube, Elbe, Weser, Tuuloma, Kemijoki and Aulne. Genetic differentiation was more pronounced in pearl mussel than in brown trout, although the drainage-specific patterns were generally similar. Genetic diversity of host and parasite was negatively correlated. The most oligotrophic, postglacially colonized areas represented genetic diversity hotspots with high conservation priority for pearl mussels, whereas their host fish displayed low diversity in these areas. This pattern can be explained by differences in the ecological niches and in the life-history strategies of both species. These results question the effectiveness of single-species approaches in the conservation of genetic aquatic resources and suggest that genetic information from species with different life-history strategies, such as invertebrates and fish, should be considered simultaneously for geographical conservation prioritization in stream ecosystems.},

	volume = {20},
	abstract = {1. Freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera L.) populations are under serious threat of extinction throughout their geographical range and only a few remnant populations are recruiting to adulthood. Consequently, M. margaritifera is classified as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. 2. Several institutions across many countries have set up Ark sites at hatcheries to culture and rear young M. margaritifera from population remnants, with the intention of stocking these juveniles into rivers. The release location must fulfill the habitat requirements for the full life-cycle of the species, so they can contribute to the next generation and thus the long-term recovery of the species. However, little research or advice exists about how to decide if river environments are suitable for stocking. 3. A protocol is presented for determining whether a M. margaritifera population will benefit from stocking hatchery reared juveniles and how to identify suitable areas. Stocking locations are considered from catchment scale to microscale using water quality (reach), macrohabitat (site) and microhabitat, including physicochemical properties of the substratum (spots). 4. A case study of the River Esk in north-east England, is incorporated to exemplify the myriad of considerations surrounding attempts to conserve M. margaritifera, and describes how implementation of the protocol can structure and assist stocking programmes.

We fitted several growth models to the shell length-age relationships of these two populations, which had different densities and age distributions. The Gompertz function showed the best fit, in terms of both RSS (residual sum of squares) and the difference between the observed maximum shell length and the asymptotic shell length. The life span of M. laevis was shorter than that reported for Margaritifera margaritifera populations at higher latitudes ({\textgreater}= 50 degrees N), which have been widely recognized as threatened. Margaritiferid mussels living at lower latitudes tend to have shorter life spans and smaller maximum size. These results suggest that margaritiferid mussels in southern regions such as M. laevis in Japan and M. margaritifera in Spain may be particularly vulnerable when conditions are unsuitable for juvenile mussels for prolonged periods.},

To obtain glochidia, gravid female mussels were collected from the Chitose River, inhabited by adult and juvenile mussels, and from the Abira River, where only adult mussels were found. Daily survival rates of glochidia from each population at various water temperatures were significantly different, and survival time was longest at the lowest temperature in each population. Maintenance of some field mussel populations might become difficult at higher water temperatures due to the short survival time of glochidia and expected low density of host fish. Daily survival rates of glochidia were compared between the Abira population at 15 degrees C and the Chitose population at 20 degrees C, since these temperatures were close to the mean water temperature during the period of glochidial release in the respective rivers. Daily mean survival rates were significantly different between the Abira population at 15 degrees C and the Chitose population at 20 degrees C. Mean glochidial survival rate for the Chitose population changed from 85.3\% to 66.2\% from 9 to13 h, whereas that for the Abira population dropped suddenly from 80.4\% to 34.2\% from 10 to 14 h after the initiation of experiment. Absence of juveniles in the Abira River might have been caused by the low glochidial viability. Survival times of free-living glochidia in Margaritiferidae tend to be shorter than in other families in Unionoida. A trade-off is suggested between high fertility and low glochidial survival rate in Margaritiferidae.},

	title = {Substantial differences in littoral fish community structure and dynamics in subtropical and temperate shallow lakes},
	volume = {54},
	abstract = {1. Fish play a key role in the functioning of temperate shallow lakes by affecting nutrient exchange among habitats as well as lake trophic structure and dynamics. These processes are, in turn, strongly influenced by the abundance of submerged macrophytes, because piscivorous fish are often abundant at high macrophyte density. Whether this applies to warmer climates as well is virtually unknown. 2. To compare fish community structure and dynamics in plant beds between subtropical and temperate shallow lakes we conducted experiments with artificial submerged and free-floating plant beds in a set of 10 shallow lakes in Uruguay (30 degrees-35 degrees S) and Denmark (55 degrees-57 degrees N), paired along a gradient of limnological characteristics. 3. The differences between regions were more pronounced than differences attributable to trophic state. The subtropical littoral fish communities were characterised by higher species richness, higher densities, higher biomass, higher trophic diversity (with predominance of omnivores and lack of true piscivores) and smaller body size than in the comparable temperate lakes. On average, fish densities were 93 ind. m(-2) (+/- 10 SE) in the subtropical and 10 ind. m(-2) (+/- 2 SE) in the temperate lakes. We found a twofold higher total fish biomass per unit of total phosphorus in the subtropical than in the temperate lakes, and as fish size is smaller in the former, the implication is that more energy reaches the littoral zone fish community of the warmer lakes. 4. Plant architecture affected the spatial distribution of fish within each climate zone. Thus, in the temperate zone fish exhibited higher densities among the artificial free-floating plants while subtropical fish were denser in the artificial submerged plant beds. These patterns appeared in most lakes, regardless of water turbidity or trophic state. 5. The subtropical littoral fish communities resembled the fish communities typically occurring in temperate eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes. Our results add to the growing evidence that climate warming may lead to more complex and omnivory-dominated food webs and higher density and dominance of smaller-sized fish. This type of community structure may lead to a weakening of the trophic cascading effects commonly observed in temperate shallow lakes and a higher risk of eutrophication.},

	abstract = {In shallow temperate lakes many ecological processes depend on submerged macrophytes. In subtropical and tropical lakes, free-floating macrophytes may be equally or more important. We tested the hypothesis that different macrophyte growth forms would be linked with different bottom-up and top-down mechanisms in out-competing phytoplankton. We compared experimentally the effects of submerged and free-floating plants on water chemistry, phytoplankton biomass, zooplankton and fish community structure in a shallow hypertrophic lake (Lake Rodo, 34degrees 55' S 56degrees10' W, Uruguay). Except for the retention of suspended solids, we found no other significant bottom-up process connected with either Eichhornia crassipes or Potamogeton pectinatus. Free-floating plants had a lower abundance of medium-sized zooplankton than any other microhabitat and submerged plants were apparently preferred by microcrustaceans. Fish showed a differential habitat use according to species, size-class and feeding habits. Dominant omnivore-planktivores, particularly the smallest size classes, preferred submerged plants. In contrast, omnivore-piscivores were significantly associated with free-floating plants. The density of omnivorous-planktivorous fish, by size class, significantly explained the distribution of medium-sized zooplankton, the high number of size 0 fish being the main factor. The abiotic environment and the structure of the zooplankton community explained little of the fish distribution pattern. Our results suggest that bottom-up effects of free-floating plants are weak when cover is low or intermediate. Top-down effects are complex, as effects on zooplankton and fish communities seem contradictory. The low piscivores: planktivores ratio in all microhabitats suggests, however, that cascading effects on phytoplankton through free-floating plant impacts on piscivorous fish are unlikely to be strong.},

A highly connected and nested architecture promotes community stability in mutualistic networks, whereas the stability of trophic networks is enhanced in compartmented and weakly connected architectures. These theoretical predictions are supported by a meta-analysis on the architecture of a large series of real pollination (mutualistic) and herbivory (trophic) networks.

The current global crisis may therefore permanently alter the biosphere's taxonomic composition by changing the rules of evolution.},

	volume = {47},
	abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Habitat degradation is a major reason for species extinctions. For parasite-host interactions, the decline of a parasite may not only be related to the parasite's tolerance to habitat degradation but also indirectly through the host's tolerance to the same disturbance. 2. Our objective was to explore the cause of population declines of the freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera by relating the age distribution, density and growth of the mussels with turbidity, sedimentation rates and density of the mussel's host, trout Salmo trutta, in 26 Swedish streams. 3. An analysis of the age structure of nine mussel populations showed that maximum age differed by 60 years, with five populations having low proportions of juvenile mussels. Adult mussel density was higher at sites where juvenile mussels occurred than at sites lacking juvenile mussels. 4. Growth of adult mussels during the past 10 years was lower in the five streams lacking recent recruitment than in the four streams with recent recruitment, indicating that some environmental factor may be negatively impacting these populations. 5. A comparison among 24 populations indicated that turbidity and sedimentation may be responsible for recruitment failure in 58\% of the populations. The age of the youngest mussel was positively related to turbidity and sedimentation, and juvenile mussel density was negatively related to turbidity and sedimentation. In contrast, trout density was not related to recruitment of mussels or sedimentation, but was positively related to turbidity in all streams, both with and without recent mussel recruitment. 6. Synthesis and applications. Recruitment failure of M. margaritifera appears to be related to its own vulnerability to turbidity and sedimentation rather than to its host's response to this type of habitat degradation. The results from our study suggest that managers might be able to evaluate the potential viability of mussel populations by measuring stream turbidity. Restoration activities to improve the mussels' environment should focus on reducing fine material transport into streams.},

	abstract = {The relationships between environmental variables, distribution of freshwater fishes and their diet were investigated at 40 sites on irrigation ditches for rice fields in central Japan. Multivariate analyses showed that fish species richness and diversity in ditches was high when fishes were able to easily invade the rice fields. Natural stream beds not covered by concrete had greater total number and biomass of fishes in irrigation ditches. The connection between ditches and rice fields was of secondary importance. Canonical correlation analysis indicated that the two principal fish community variables, abundance and diversity, were respectively represented by the presence of the minnow, Gnathopogon elongatus elongatus, and the absence of the loach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus. Most fishes in the irrigation ditches predominantly preyed upon aquatic insects such as ephemeropteran nymphs, chironomid larvae and trichopteran larvae, but aerial insects and benthic algae were also fed upon by a few species. Small fishes ({\textless}4 cm SL) preyed more on chironomid and less on trichopteran larvae than large (\&GE;4 cm SL) fishes. The diet overlap between species was extremely high for small fishes in ditches weakly connected with rice fields. The recent changes in rice fields and irrigation ditches to increase production efficiency has led to a decrease in fish diversity. For the coexistence of rice production and fish diversity in rice areas, a new irrigation system, where fishes can easily invade rice fields and where plenty of invertebrates are available for fishes, should be developed.},

	title = {Early warning signals of extinction in deteriorating environments},
	volume = {467},
	abstract = {During the decline to extinction, animal populations may present dynamical phenomena not exhibited by robust populations(1,2). Some of these phenomena, such as the scaling of demographic variance, are related to small size(3-6) whereas others result from density-dependent nonlinearities(7). Although understanding the causes of population extinction has been a central problem in theoretical biology for decades(8), the ability to anticipate extinction has remained elusive(9). Here we argue that the causes of a population's decline are central to the predictability of its extinction. Specifically, environmental degradation may cause a tipping point in population dynamics, corresponding to a bifurcation in the underlying population growth equations, beyond which decline to extinction is almost certain. In such cases, imminent extinction will be signalled by critical slowing down (CSD). We conducted an experiment with replicate laboratory populations of Daphnia magna to test this hypothesis. We show that populations crossing a transcritical bifurcation, experimentally induced by the controlled decline in environmental conditions, show statistical signatures of CSD after the onset of environmental deterioration and before the critical transition. Populations in constant environments did not have these patterns. Four statistical indicators all showed evidence of the approaching bifurcation as early as 110 days (similar to 8 generations) before the transition occurred. Two composite indices improved predictability, and comparative analysis showed that early warning signals based solely on observations in deteriorating environments without reference populations for standardization were hampered by the presence of transient dynamics before the onset of deterioration, pointing to the importance of reliable baseline data before environmental deterioration begins. The universality of bifurcations in models of population dynamics suggests that this phenomenon should be general(10-12).},

We compared fish catch per unit effort (CPUE) and species richness and used an indirect gradient analysis to investigate fish-plant relationships within three aquatic macrophytes beds (Cabomba furcata, Eichhornia azurea, Nymphaea amazonum), and explored microhabitat influence (indexed by eight variables related to physical structure and water quality) on the structure of fish assemblages. Rarefaction analysis was used to compare fish species richness among the vegetated habitats. We captured a total of 1599 fish constituting 23 species, 7 families and 3 orders. Fish CPUE and species richness increased relative to microhabitat structure innate to the macrophytes; higher CPUE and richness were observed in C. furcata beds, a submerged aquatic macrophyte with finely dissected leaves. On the contrary, N. amazonum, a species that provides low microhabitat complexity, harbored fewer individual fish and number of species. Reproduction dynamics, hydrology and the amount of available plant-generated habitat structure (surface effect) contributed to the disproportionally high number of individuals captured during the dry season. Our data suggest that the microhabitat physical structure (e.g., edge distance, stem density and patch size) provided by macrophyte beds in the lagoons of the Upper Parana River may play a more important role than physicochemistry (e.g., oxygen, temperature and pH) at mediating distribution patterns of small-sized fishes.},

The importance of biogeographic, climatic, economic, and demographic factors as drivers of this trend is increasingly being realized but as yet there is no consensus regarding their relative importance. Whereas little may be done to mitigate the effects of geography and climate on invasions, a wider range of options may exist to moderate the impacts of economic and demographic drivers. Here we use the most recent data available from Europe to partition between macroecological, economic, and demographic variables the variation in alien species richness of bryophytes, fungi, vascular plants, terrestrial insects, aquatic invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Only national wealth and human population density were statistically significant predictors in the majority of models when analyzed jointly with climate, geography, and land cover. The economic and demographic variables reflect the intensity of human activities and integrate the effect of factors that directly determine the outcome of invasion such as propagule pressure, pathways of introduction, eutrophication, and the intensity of anthropogenic disturbance. The strong influence of economic and demographic variables on the levels of invasion by alien species demonstrates that future solutions to the problem of biological invasions at a national scale lie in mitigating the negative environmental consequences of human activities that generate wealth and by promoting more sustainable population growth.},

	abstract = {Hybridization between native and non-native species has consequences for survival and growth rates of hybrid offspring, but the influences on their functional roles such as habitat use are little studied and poorly understood. The Japanese native common carp Cyprinus carpio coexist and hybridize with non-native domesticated carp in natural Japanese lakes. We have combined stable isotope and molecular information to examine whether habitat use of carp varies depending on the degree of hybridization between native and non-native carp. We sampled 69 carp from Lake Kasumigaura where hybrid swarms between native and non-native carp are advancing, evaluated the degree of hybridization for each individual by genotyping five single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, and analyzed their carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. Although we did not find any genetically pure native carp in the lake, the results showed that carp delta 13C increased with increasing frequency of non-native alleles but that delta 15N did not change. This indicates that non-native carp use the littoral zone more frequently than native carp. This difference in habitat use was supported by a multisource mixing model, showing that the contribution of limnetic primary consumers to the diets of non-native carp was lower than that of individuals with the highest frequency of native alleles. By combining two very different methods, our results thus suggest that multiple-generation hybridization can influence habitat and resource use. Habitat partitioning should be considered when evaluating the genetic impacts of invasive species and races on native species and ecosystem processes.},

We also describe afrontier in stream research that relies on this multiscale approach: assessing the consequences and mechanisms of ecological processes occurring at the network scale.

Connectivity is known to positively influence metapopulation demography and genetics by increasing the rescue effect and thus favoring individual and gene flow between populations. This result has not been tested in the special case of dendritic networks, which encompass stream and cave ecosystem for instance. We propose a first approach using an individual based model to explore the population demography and genetics in various dendritic networks. To do so, we first generate a large number of different networks, and we analyze the relationship between their hydrographical characteristics and connectivity. We show that connectivity mean and variance of connectivity are strongly correlated in dendritic networks. Connectivity segregates two types of networks: Hortonian and non-Hortonian networks. We then simulate the population dynamics for a simple life cycle in each of the generated networks, and we analyze persistence time as well as populations structure at quasi-stationary state. Our main results show that connectivity in dendritic networks can promote local extinction and genetic isolation by distance at low dispersal and diminish the size of the metapopulation at high dispersal. We discuss these unexpected findings in the light of connectivity spatial distribution in dendritic networks in the case of our model.},

	volume = {85},
	abstract = {Over the past 50 years, conceptual developments in stream ecology and ecosystem ecology have converged, thanks to biogeochemistry and the recognition that in situ processing on one hand and spatial translation of materials, processes, and influence along flowpaths on the other, unite to generate a holistic picture of ecosystem functioning at the landscape level. Early emphases in stream biogeochemistry involved organic carbon dynamics and whole-ecosystem budgets. These approaches were holistic but cumbersome and laborious and ignored several crucial issues, such as variation in organic matter quality. Nutrient-spiraling approaches rectified this shortcoming and provided a flowpath-specific technique for resolving the dynamics of both inorganic and organic materials and for comparing streams of different sizes and flow rates. The ability of nutrient-spiraling approaches to deal with multiple elements and fluctuating flows, including floods, remains elusive, however. There are several opportunities for stream ecology and biogeochemistry to continue cross-fertilization to the benefit of both disciplines. Chief among these is an emphasis on streams as spatially distributed heterogeneous systems, constantly shifting in shape and configuration through time. Hydrologic and material flowpaths integrate this heterogeneity as they alternately converge and diverge and perfuse the channel, hyporheic zone, riparian zone, and floodplain as they transport materials inexorably downstream. Conceptualizing streams as branched structures adds new insights to biogeochemical processing in space and raises several questions about network shape as an independent variable influencing biogeochemical dynamics such as nutrient retention efficiency. Junctions of streams emerge as potentially significant functional units when streams are viewed as networks. Ultimately, stream drainages finely dissect the land and receive water from soils in channelless upland regions which are themselves pervaded by convergent flowpaths, thus blurring the difference between streams and the landscapes they drain. Other lucrative future research opportunities are discussed including a plea for greater use of stoichiometric approaches and a consideration of geometry, disturbance, and legacies at multiple scales of space and time. We predict that future research in biogeochemistry will increasingly seek and find similarities among diverse ecosystem types by focusing on the spatially explicit flowpaths that integrate and connect them.},

A survey of freshwater pearl mussels was carried out on rivers in County Donegal, north-west Ireland, to determine the current distribution, size and density of M. margaritifera populations, as well as to identify potential threats to mussels there. 3. The survey revealed the freshwater pearl mussel to be widespread, particularly in the western half of the county. However, densities of mussels at most sites are low, with just two sites having mussel densities of over 5 m(-2). Furthermore, the species appears to be absent from a number of sites from which it had been previously recorded. 4. According to the literature, there is a long history of pearl fishing in Co. Donegal and neighbouring counties. Evidence from heaps of shells found on the river bed and banks at several sites and recent anecdotal reports from local people suggest pearl fishing is being practised on all rivers investigated during the present study. 5. The main conservation requirements for M. margaritifera populations in Donegal are to maintain water quality at its present high standard and, as pearl fishing appears to be a widespread and immediate threat to the remaining mussel populations, to enforce existing legislation designed to protect M. margaritifera.},

	abstract = {In order to describe patterns of relative growth during the early life-history of the bitterling Rhodeus sericeus (Pallas, 1776), we examined 21 morphometric characters. These were expressed in 24 indices as a percentage of standard length (SL) and head length (HL) respectively. and divided into groups according to their pattern of relative growth. Nine characters exhibited isometric growth (relative proportion did not change with increasing SL). Eleven characters exhibited positive allometric growth (relative proportion increased with increasing SL) and four negative allometric growth. Stabilisation of characters may occur when bitterling reach sexual maturity, however some may continue to grow allometrically during the adult period. Caudal peduncle depth factor and body shape factor were employed to describe changes in morphological indicators of locomotor activity. Both factors exhibit steep allometric growth in specimens with remnants of finfold, gradually stabilizing in immature specimens without finfold, and isometric growth during adult period. Following our results and examination of data from the literature we conclude that bitterling, although a species with a precocial form of development, still retains a larval period. However, its duration is short compared to other cyprinids. Allometric growth is a typical feature of the entire life-history of bitterling and cannot be used as an indicator of the transition from larval to juvenile period.},

Our mark-recapture study of stream salamanders reveals both a strong upstream bias in dispersal and a surprisingly high rate of overland dispersal to adjacent headwater streams. This evidence of route-dependent variation in dispersal rates suggests a spatial mechanism for population stability in headwater-stream salamanders. Our results link the movement behavior of stream salamanders to network topology, and they underscore the importance of identifying and protecting critical dispersal pathways when addressing region-wide population declines.},

	abstract = {Seed-dispersal mutualisms have a fundamental role in regenerating natural communities(1,2). Interest in the importance of seed dispersal to plant communities has been heightened by worldwide declines in animal dispersers(3-5). One view, the 'keystone mutualist hypothesis', predicts that these human-caused losses will trigger a cascade of linked extinctions throughout the community(6). Implicitly, this view holds that mutualisms, such as seed dispersal, are crucial ecological interactions that maintain the structure and diversity of natural communities. Although many studies suggest the importance of mutualism(3,7), empirical evidence for community-level impacts of mutualists has remained anecdotal(8,9), and the central role of mutualism, relative to other species interactions, has long been debated in the theoretical literature(10,11). Here I report the community-level consequences of a biological invasion that disrupts important seed-dispersal mutualisms. I show that invasion of South African shrublands by the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) leads to a shift in composition of the plant community, owing to a disproportionate reduction in the densities of large-seeded plants. This study suggests that the preservation of mutualistic interactions may be essential for maintaining natural communities.},

Moreover, the extent to which community assembly is intrinsically indeterministic (i.e., the degree to which community composition depends on chance events) remains an open question. The complexity of this issue argues for field studies in a semicontrolled environment. We studied species richness and community composition of a guild of phreatophytes along dendritic networks of small forest streams in western Belgium. The streams, situated at the forest-covered headwaters of six different watersheds and characterized by homogeneous environmental conditions, impose spatial dispersal constraints to the plant species. This allowed us to assess the relative importance of deterministic processes guiding community assembly. More specifically, we focused on the role of species migration and colonization processes relative to local processes (competitive exclusion and passive habitat selection) on species richness and on community composition. Our analyses at three consecutive levels (species number, community composition, and species) revealed that plant community assembly along the stream systems is based on (1) historical and stochastic colonization events of species and (2) subsequent deterministic downstream dispersal processes. Apparently, due to the influence of historical chance events, deterministic processes do not necessarily result in community convergence. In addition we show that continuous downstream dispersal and colonization can compensate for local extinction processes. This is another piece of evidence that, when studying community composition, it is absolutely necessary to place communities in their spatial contexts.},

These shortcomings might be remedied by a more deliberate effort to generate new, creative ideas about streams that will enhance their use in developing general theory. The creative process has been thoroughly studied by psychologists and, while the field is still in flux, most cognitive psychologists agree that juxtaposition of disparate concepts or observations can stimulate new ideas. How this technique might enhance stream ecology is illustrated with an analogy between functional morphology and stream ecology. Definition of form and function in streams is required to develop this analogy and a hierarchical, scale-dependent approach is essential. The effect of structure and configuration of stream channels on their functioning is a promising research area that can be applied at several scales. Parallels with landscape ecology are strong. Extending this analogy to larger scales reminds us that streams are, in essence, branched systems; however, little research has been done on the ecological consequences of branching patterns in streams and rivers. Combination of this branched image with other surface and subsurface water bodies leads to an even broader view of streams as planar systems, intimately connecting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems along flowpaths. This exploration of ideas about stream shape and its functional consequences suggests several opportunities for stream ecology to contribute to general ecological theory. More importantly, this effort suggests that the process of idea generation is straightforward, accessible, and beneficial for both science and scientist.},

We used fecal nitrogen levels as an indicator of habitat quality of sika deer (Cervus nippon) and explored important landscape elements influencing nitrogen levels, taking deer density into account. We established 92 plots differing in deer density and landscape structure on the Boso Peninsula, central Japan, and collected fecal samples along a 1-km transect at each plot. The regression models involving two independent variables, i.e., deer density and the length of forest edge within an area of 100 or 200 m from the transect, were selected based on the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). Levels of fecal nitrogen were positively correlated with the length of the forest edge and negatively correlated with population density of deer. The area of 100 or 200 m from the transect most likely reflected the behavioral scale of the deer. Coverage of palatable understory vegetation increased with proximity to forest edge and decreased with deer density. Variability in the level of fecal nitrogen could thus be explained by food availability in the landscape. These results suggest that landscape alterations increase the carrying capacity of sika deer and thereby increase impacts upon the ecosystem.},

Plant structure can be defined by its size, heterogeneity and connectivity. We tested the hypothesis that these three components and all possible, interactions affect the level of parasitism of Trichogramma evanescens and that parasitism can be predicted if the structure of a plant is measured. We quantified and varied the structure of three-dimensional artificial plants to determine which component(s) of plant structure explain variability of parasitism and to develop a model that predicts parasitism by Trichogramma females. This model was validated with three natural tritrophic systems. The experiment with artificial plants revealed that plant structure affected host-finding, success, which was higher on plants with a simple structure and low on plants with a complex structure. A response surface regression showed that the linear and quadratic terms of connectivity were highly significant, indicating that connectivity best explained the variability in the rate of parasitism obtained. The interaction between connectivity and heterogeneity was also significant. Observed values of parasitism from experiments with three natural tritrophic systems fit predicted values of parasitism generated by the model, indicating, that parasitism can be predicted if heterogeneity and connectivity of a plant are known. Consequences of these results in regard to population dynamics, evolution and biological control are discussed.},

Here, we develop a patch-model of a whole plant-animal community and explore its persistence. To assess the role of network structure, we build three versions of the model. In the first version, we use the exact network of interactions of two real mutualistic communities. In the other versions, we randomize the observed network of interactions using two different null models. We show that the community response to habitat loss is affected by network structure. Real communities start to decay sooner than random communities, but persist for higher destruction levels. There is a destruction threshold at which the community collapses. Our model is the first attempt to describe the dynamics of whole mutualistic metacommunities interacting in realistic ways.},

We investigated bird abundance and Leptonychia dispersal ecology in fragments isolated for {\textgreater}70 yr, as compared with 3,500 ha of continuous forest. Birds that dispersed Leptonychia seeds in continuous forest were rare or absent in small fragments, where fewer seeds were removed from each tree, far fewer seedlings occurred {\textgreater}10 m from parent trees, and far more seedlings occurred in dense aggregations under parental crowns. Overall, our samples showed that fewer juvenile Leptonychia recruited in fragments than in continuous forest.

We predicted that habitat isolation should constrain the distribution of the mainly vegetatively dispersed P. tiliacea more than the sexually dispersed P. acetabulum. 2 All patches of habitat containing suitable host trees for the study species were mapped from aerial, infra-red photographs. Presence and abundance of the lichens were recorded for a total of 3237 trees in 94 patches. 3 Patch identity had strong influence on presence of both species on individual trees. Within patches, presence was positively correlated with tree size and was also influenced by tree species. 4 At patch-level, species presence was positively correlated with tree number and negatively correlated with the proportion of the boundary that bordered coniferous forest and with isolation. Abundance was mostly correlated with tree size or with the number of large trees at tree- and patch-levels, respectively. For P. acetabulum, within-patch abundance was also influenced by isolation from other patches. 5 Presence at patch-level was affected by isolation for both species, but this effect differed between the three isolation measures used. There was no clear evidence that the distribution of P. tiliacea was more constrained by isolation than that of P. acetabulum. 6 Whilst this study emphasizes the importance of habitat quantity for species occupancy and local abundance, it shows that explanations of species occurrence in fragmented landscapes must also involve variables describing habitat quality and spatial configuration. Moreover it illustrates the difficulties in predicting species' occupancy from general knowledge about their dispersal traits.},

Less well appreciated is the likelihood that climate change will directly disrupt or eliminate mutually beneficial ( mutualistic) ecological interactions between species even before extinctions occur. We explored the potential disruption of a ubiquitous mutualistic interaction of terrestrial habitats, that between plants and their animal pollinators, via climate change. We used a highly resolved empirical network of interactions between 1420 pollinator and 429 plant species to simulate consequences of the phenological shifts that can be expected with a doubling of atmospheric CO2. Depending on model assumptions, phenological shifts reduced the floral resources available to 17-50\% of all pollinator species, causing as much as half of the ancestral activity period of the animals to fall at times when no food plants were available. Reduced overlap between plants and pollinators also decreased diet breadth of the pollinators. The predicted result of these disruptions is the extinction of pollinators, plants and their crucial interactions.},

Such disruptions can occur via the introduction of alien pollinators, seed dispersers, herbivores, predators or plants, and we define here the many potential outcomes of each situation. The frequency and circumstances under which each category of mechanisms operates are also poorly known. Most evidence is from population-level studies, and the implications for global biodiversity are difficult to predict.

Models predict that mutualists might often evolve into parasites, can abandon their partners to live autonomously and are also vulnerable to extinction. Yet a basic empirical question, whether mutualisms commonly break down, has been mostly overlooked. As we discuss here, recent progress in molecular systematics helps address this question. Newly constructed phylogenies reveal that parasites as well as autonomous (non-mutualist) taxa are nested within ancestrally mutualistic clades. Although models have focused on the propensity of mutualism to become parasitic, such shifts appear relatively rarely. By contrast, diverse systems exhibit reversions to autonomy, and this might be a common and unexplored endpoint to mutualism.},

First, connectivity patterns of-river-creek networks differ from linear landscapes, and these differences in connectivity can either enhance or reduce metapopulation persistence compared to linear systems, depending on the details of dispersal. Second, habitat fragmentation in dendritic landscapes has different (and arguably, more severe) consequences on fragment size than in either linear or two-dimensional systems, resulting in both smaller fragments and higher variance in fragment size. Third, dendritic landscapes can induce striking mismatches between the geometry of dispersal and the geometry of disturbance, and as is the case for arid-lands fishes, such mismatches can be important for population persistence.},

In invaded areas, crazy ants extirpate the red land crab, the dominant endemic consumer on the forest floor. In doing so, crazy ants indirectly release seedling recruitment, enhance species richness of seedlings, and slow litter breakdown. In the forest canopy, new associations between this invasive ant and honeydew-secreting scale insects accelerate and diversify impacts. Sustained high densities of foraging ants on canopy trees result in high population densities of host-generalist scale insects and growth of sooty moulds, leading to canopy dieback and even deaths of canopy trees. The indirect fallout from the displacement of a native 'keystone' species by an ant invader, itself abetted by introduced/cryptogenic mutualists, produces synergism in impacts to precipitate invasional 'meltdown' in this system.},

Mussel species distributions were mostly unrelated to differences in immigration and only weakly related to downstream direction, giving some indication of structuring by differences in extinction. Mussel species distributions were not related to the number of fish species used as hosts for mussel larvae. Mussel species were more likely to overlap on common fish hosts; however, the host-use matrix was not nested-groups of mussel species used different sets of host fish species in a pattern that appeared phylogenetically related. Sites with high fish host abundance may support high mussel diversity by promoting the survival of mussel species that are less able to attract and infect hosts. Thus, nestedness in freshwater mussel communities may be driven by the array of host fish resources, combined with differences in species' abilities to use fish hosts.

	abstract = {Freshwater pearl mussels (Margartifera margaritifera L.) are among the most critically threatened freshwater bivalves worldwide. The pearl mussel simultaneously fulfils criteria of indicator, flagship, keystone and umbrella species and can thus be considered an ideal target species for the process conservation of aquatic ecosystem functioning. The development of conservation strategies for freshwater pearl mussels and for other bivalve species faces many challenges, including the selection of priority populations for conservation and strategic decisions on habitat restoration and/or captive breeding. This article summarises the current information about the species' systematics and phylogeny, its distribution and status as well as about its life history strategy and genetic population structure. Based on this information, integrative conservation strategies for freshwater mollusc species which combine genetic and ecological information are discussed. Holistic conservation strategies for pearl mussels require the integration of Conservation Genetics and Conservation Ecology actions at various spatial scales, from the individual and population level to global biodiversity conservation strategies. The availability of high resolution genetic markers for the species and the knowledge of the critical stages in the life cycle, particularly of the most sensitive post-parasitic phase, are important prerequisites for conservation. Effective adaptive conservation management also requires an evaluation of previous actions and management decisions. As with other freshwater bivalves, an integrative conservation approach that identifies and sustains ecological processes and evolutionary lineages is urgently needed to protect and manage freshwater pearl mussel diversity. Such research is important for the conservation of free-living populations, as well as for artificial culturing and breeding techniques, which have recently been or which are currently being established for freshwater pearl mussels in several countries.},

Among these are important pollinators and seed dispersers. This study is a first attempt to document cascading effects on vertebrate-pollinated native plant species in Guam. We investigated flower visitation, seed set and germination in two native plants, the mangrove tree Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and the forest tree Erythrina uariegata var. orientalis. Both species are bird-pollinated. Studies were conducted on two Mariana islands, Guam (with high density of snakes) and Saipan (with nearly no snakes). Visitation rates by birds were high on Saipan, but zero on Guam. Insects and lizards visited flowers to a low extent on both islands. Only lizards were potential effective pollinators. Seed set of both species were significantly higher on Saipan compared to Guam, and for B. gymnorrhiza, seedling recruitment was significantly higher on Saipan. Hence, these bird-pollinated species appear highly dependent on bird visitors for reproduction. The eradication of flower-visiting birds by the invasive treesnake thus secondarily results in broken mutualistic interactions, which may, in turn, result in a lower recruitment of native plants. Thus, the treesnake affects not only potential prey species, but its effects cascade through the entire ecosystem on Guam. Conservation actions should be directed towards an improved recruitment (artificial pollination, planting) of the affected plant species. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We investigated the effects of removing large mammals on an ant-Acacia mutualism in an African savanna. Ten years of large-herbivore exclusion reduced the nectar and housing provided by plants to ants, increasing antagonistic behavior by a mutualistic ant associate and shifting competitive dominance within the plant-ant community from this nectar-dependent mutualist to an antagonistic species that does not depend on plant rewards. Trees occupied by this antagonist suffered increased attack by stem-boring beetles, grew more slowly, and experienced doubled mortality relative to trees occupied by the mutualistic ant. These results show that large mammals maintain cooperation within a widespread symbiosis and suggest complex cascading effects of megafaunal extinction.},

	abstract = {The distributions of two unionoids (fragile papershell Leptodea fragilis and pink heelsplitter Potamilus alatus) were examined in five North American Midwest river systems in relation to the location of dams on the rivers. These dams were non-navigational (without locks), lacked fish ladders, and varied in height from 1 to 17.7 m. Both species were restricted in their distribution to the river downstream of the darns. This suggests that the host fish(es) of these species was unable to move upstream of these obstacles. Both unionoids are believed to parasitize the freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens. Several endangered unionoid species also may use this fish, or other dam-limited fishes, as hosts. Dams, even lowhead structures, may contribute to the overall depletion of unionoids by artificially restricting their distributions and isolating populations from each other. Management practices for endangered fishes and mussels must take into account these physical obstacles.},

	abstract = {Ecologists and conservation biologists have used many measures of landscape structure(1-5) to predict the population dynamic consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation(6-8), but these measures are not well justified by population dynamic theory. Here we introduce a new measure for highly fragmented landscapes, termed the metapopulation capacity, which is rigorously derived from metapopulation theory and can easily be applied to real networks of habitat fragments with known areas and connectivities. Technically, metapopulation capacity is the leading eigenvalue of an appropriate 'landscape' matrix. A species is predicted to persist in a landscape if the metapopulation capacity of that landscape is greater than a threshold value determined by the properties of the species. Therefore, metapopulation capacity can conveniently be used to rank different landscapes in terms of their capacity to support viable metapopulations. We present an empirical example on multiple networks occupied by an endangered species of butterfly. Using this theory, we may also calculate how the metapopulation capacity is changed by removing habitat fragments from or adding new ones into specific spatial locations, or by changing their areas. The metapopulation capacity should rnd many applications in metapopulation ecology, landscape ecology and conservation biology.},

	volume = {19},
	abstract = {Freshwater mussels (unionids) are increasingly recognized as important providers of ecosystem services, yet are among the most endangered fauna in the world. Because unionids are generally sessile and require specific fish hosts for development and dispersal, they are particularly vulnerable to habitat degradation. Surprisingly, little is known about the distribution of genetic diversity in freshwater mussels and this gap has a negative impact on taxonomy, monitoring, conservation and ecological research in these species. Here, we focus on western North American Anodonta, one of only three genera known to exist in this broad landscape and which contains three highly divergent lineages. We describe phylogeographical subdivision in the most widespread and diverse of these lineages, which includes Anodonta californiensis and Anodonta nuttalliana and occurs from Canada to Mexico. Using mitochondrial and nuclear data, we found that genetic structuring within this clade is inconsistent with morphologically based species designations, but instead follows patterns of vicariance among major hydrogeologic basins. Furthermore, there was a strong tendency for population diversity within drainage systems to increase downstream, implying greater habitat or host fish availability in this direction. Microsatellite results indicated that sampling locations were all genetically distinct, even at short distances. Many of our sample populations showed evidence of a recent demographic bottleneck, although this effect seemed to be very local and not drainage or basin-specific. This study provides a foundation for the establishment of appropriate management units and future research on adaptive differentiation and host fish relationships.},

	abstract = {Abundance, depth distribution, potential productivity and respiration of periphyton on short-time (1 month) and long-time incubated strips were followed monthly during the winter-spring (January-May) transition in a shallow eutrophic lake. A taxonomic shift occurred from dominance of diatoms under ice to chlorophyte dominance in spring communities on the long-time incubated strips, while diatoms dominated until May on the short-time incubated strips. Periphyton biomass accrual was low during the ice-covered winter months (November-January: 4 mg chl a m(-2) month(-1)), but increased to a maximum of 112 mg chl a m(-2) month(-1) immediately after ice-out in February. During February-April, the biomass remained constant before declining in May. Periphyton on long-time incubated strips was equally distributed in the water column in winter (January-February), but was higher near the water surface in spring (March-May). Periphyton did not change with depth on the short-time incubated strips. The potential production to respiration ratio (P/R) was negatively correlated with periphyton biomass. Throughout the study, P/R was {\textless}1 for the short-time incubated periphyton, while this was only the case in March-April for the long-time incubations. This study showed a high productive capacity of winter periphyton, resulting in accumulation of a relatively high periphytic biomass early in the season. A massive periphyton density in eutrophic lakes already in winter-spring may potentially delay or prevent the establishment and re-occurrence of submerged macrophytes in the early oligotrophication phase following a reduction of the external nutrient loading.},

	volume = {89},
	abstract = {1 We investigated morphological responses of the submerged macrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum L. to water depth and wave exposure when grown in the same substrate at two sites in two eutrophic lakes. Periphyton production was 4-8 times higher at sheltered than at wave-exposed sites and its influence was further investigated in a glasshouse experiment. Morphological responses in both experiments were compared by allometric analyses, with shoot weight as covariate. 2 In the field study, plants shoots exhibited similar responses (increased plant height and branch length, and decreased branch number) to sheltered conditions as to deep water. The partitioning between above- and below-ground biomass however, differed, with below-ground decreasing with an increasing water depth, but increasing or remaining unaffected at sheltered compared with exposed conditions. 3 In the glasshouse experiment, plant responses to water depth were similar to those in the field study. Furthermore, plant height increased when plants were overgrown with periphyton. 4 High production of periphytic algae at sheltered sites appears to cause light limitation of macrophytes. However, other factors such as nutrient uptake also appears to determine morphological responses. At sheltered sites, where leaf nutrient uptake is reduced by abundant periphyton and thick boundary layers, plants allocate more biomass to roots. At deep and wave-exposed sites, the absence of periphyton allows plants to take up nutrients through their leaves and allocation of biomass to shoots increases photosynthesis. 5 Overall, relative allocation to shoot and root biomass appears to be primarily controlled by nutrient availability, whereas allocation of available shoot biomass to particular structures is controlled by light availability.},

Ash free dry mass (AFDM) levels ranged from non-existent to {\textgreater}20 g/m(2). Abiotic factors influencing charophyte populations were investigated. Regression analysis showed that charophyte biomass was inversely related to water depth and positively related to Secchi depth suggesting that irradiance strongly influences charophyte distribution in this lake. Data from photosynthetic measurements and photosynthesis-irradiance curves confirmed this hypothesis, as I-k (irradiance at which photosynthesis is initially saturated) was an order of magnitude greater than the ambient light reaching the charophyte populations. In addition, autotrophic respiration exceeded net photosynthesis under ambient light conditions. Inorganic phosphorus concentration was not significantly related to charophyte biomass. Nutrient kinetics favored phytoplankton growth over Chara, assuming phosphorus limited conditions. Although nutrient concentration may influence Chara phenology and abundance, light appears to be a stronger regulator in this subtropical lentic ecosystem.},

Three substrates (bamboo, jutestick and bamboo side shoot) were tested. Rohu (Labeo rohita), catla (Calla catla) and kalbaush (L. calbasu) were stocked at a 60:40:15 stocking ratio and at a total stocking density of 11,500 per hectare in 15 earthen ponds with five treatments: standard fertilization as input (Control), control plus supplemental feeding with rice bran and oil cake (Feed), control plus bamboo substrate (Bamboo), control plus jutestick substrate (Jutestick) and control plus bamboo side shoot substrate (Kanchi). Water quality, plankton and periphyton were monitored throughout the experiment. Significantly higher ammonia concentrations were recorded in Control and Feed treatments. The chlorophyll alpha concentration of pond water was significantly higher in the Feed treatment than in the Jutestick treatment. Dry matter content and mean abundance of the periphyton communities were higher in the first and the last month of the experiment without significant difference among the three substrate types. Periphyton chlorophyll alpha concentrations per unit surface area did not vary significantly among different substrate types but increased throughout the experimental period and decreased with increasing water depth. Specific growth rates of rohu and catla were higher in Substrate and Feed treatments than in the Control treatment. Combined net yields of fish in Control, Feed, Bamboo, Jutestick and Kanchi treatments were 1226, 1960, 2098, 2048 and 2032 kg ha(-1) 135 day(-1) , respectively. Production in substrate systems was significantly higher (ANOVA, P{\textless}0.001) than in the Feed and Control treatments. Nitrogen retentions in fish in the Substrate treatments were 1.6 times higher than in the Control treatment and 1.3 times higher than in the Feed treatment. Net profit margin was highest in Jutestick treatment (46\%). The substrate-based systems performed better than the conventional systems, both from ecological and economical points of view.

Forest fragments were relatively similar in vegetation and ranged in area from 0.5 to 21.5 ha. Samples were collected by pitfall traps from forest-fragment interior and edge and from the surrounding agro-urban environment. Abundance and species richness of carabids was lowest in the contiguous forest and highest in the fragment surroundings. Contiguous forest had none, large (9.6-21.5 ha) and medium-sized forest fragments (4.2-8.2 ha) a few, and small fragments (0.5-3.0 ha) several species typically found in the surrounding open habitats. High carabid diversity in the small fragments and in the surroundings was probably related to the higher vegetational diversity in such sites. High diversity of vegetation, in turn, was due to moderate human disturbance and effects of vegetation succession. Most of the abundant carabid species were non-randomly distributed among the habitat types. Some specialized forest carabids were caught exclusively in contiguous forest and only the most generalized forest species were obtained from small forest fragments. These results indicate that in order to preserve the integrity of forest arthropod faunas in urban areas it is essential to leave large, continuous forest tracts untouched to preserve specialist species and forest species assemblages.},

There is a need for a monitoring protocol that would signal changes in the habitat and the biota it supports. Spiders (Araneae) are a group of predators containing many bog specialist species, some of which are of Red Data Book status. Twelve-month continuous trapping in 11 basin bogs in Cheshire (western England) established the species present, their phenology, and relative abundance. Data were combined with those from another 21 lowland bogs obtained from the literature and a number of common statistical descriptors calculated. Some of these were of little value, but the number of spider bog indicator species is shown to be a surrogate for the conservation value of the total invertebrate fauna of bogs in the study area. A model short-survey protocol is devised and tested. Using this protocol and suggested stopping rules, it appears that adequate indication of good peatland sites can be assumed when the naturalness index exceeds 0.5, the species quality index is {\textgreater}= 1.8, and the indicator species-area relationship gives a datum point on or above the trend line derived from the full data set.

	abstract = {Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) captured in pitfall traps were compared within and among three Ecological Land Types in the Green Mountain National Forest, Vermont, to determine if beetle distributions can be linked to an ecological classification system designed to reflect biological diversity. Beetles were sampled in a nested-scale design comprising three ecological land types, three polygons representing each ecological land type, five sites within each polygon, and six individual traps at each site. A nested analysis of variance showed only 2 of 35 species to vary significantly in relative abundance across ecological land types; most of the significant effects were at the site scale. To determine whether sites might sort into groups based on their beetle assemblages, sites were ordinated by detrended correspondence analysis and classified by two-way indicator species analysis. Ordinations suggested that the distribution of ground beetles was somewhat influenced by site moisture; classification separated groups of hygrophilous species and wet sites from other ecologically uninterpretable species assemblages and site-groups. Several of the site-groups contained sites affiliated primarily with one ecological land type. However, a nested analysis of variance using the relative abundance of each of the species assemblages again showed most significant effects to be at the site scale. Results indicated that ground beetle distributions were not significantly linked with ecological land types and that the ground beetle fauna of the mid-elevation forests of the western Green Mountains is comprised mainly of forest generalists, with some specialist species responding to a moisture gradient at the site scale. Because the ecological land type units did not explain distributions of carabids, these organisms should next be related to higher and lower scales within the classification system. Distributions of other invertebrate and vertebrate species should also be studied to test the utility of the ecological classification system for monitoring forest biodiversity.},

Pairwise correlations in abundance between a songbird and a butterfly species were performed with the three songbird species-Henslow's sparrow Ammodramus henslowii, grasshopper sparrow A. savannarum, and dickcissel Spiza americana-and 17 butterfly species, chosen because they were the most frequently observed butterflies in each of three ecological groups (prairie specialist, grassland, generalist) or because they were taxonomically close to the prairie specialists in analysis. Butterfly species in the most restrictive ecological group (specialists) significantly and positively correlated most strongly with the three songbirds, especially at the scale of the entire study region and in subregions where both species in the correlation were more abundant. Grassland butterflies (occurring widely in native prairie and old fields) and generalist butterflies were similarly lower than specialists in degree of covariance with the birds. Correlations of the birds as a group with all observed butterfly individuals in each of the three ecological groups showed similar patterns. Other studies have shown that diversities of distantly related animal groups may not correlate well among habitats and regions. But this study suggests that, within a habitat and region, conservation programs benefitting grassland birds can be favorable for co-occurring prairie-specialist butterflies and that certain bird and butterfly species can be effective indicators of each other.

	title = {Flagships, umbrellas, and keystones: {Is} single-species management passe in the landscape era?},
	volume = {83},
	abstract = {Because it is so difficult to monitor and manage every aspect of biodiversity, several shortcuts have been proposed whereby we monitor and/or protect single species. The indicator species concept is problematic because there is no consensus on what the indicator is supposed to indicate and because it is difficult to know which is the best indicator species even when we agree on what it should indicate. The umbrella species (a species that needs such large tracts of habitat that saving it will automatically save many other species) seems like a better approach, although often whether many other species will really fall under the umbrella is a matter of faith rather than research. Intensive management of an indicator or an umbrella species (for example, by transplant or supplemental feeding) is a contradiction in terms because the rest of the community to be indicated or protected does not receive such treatment. A flagship species, normally a charismatic large vertebrate, is one that can be used to anchor a conservation campaign because it arouses public interest and sympathy, but a flagship need not be a good indicator or umbrella. And conservation of flagship species is often very expensive. Further, management regimes of two flagship species can conflict. Ecosystem management, often on a landscape scale, is a proposed solution to problems of single-species management. Keep the ecosystem healthy, according to this view, and component species will all thrive. However, conservationists have concerns about ecosystem management. First, if is variously defined, and many definitions emphasize the commodities ecosystems provide for humans rather than how humans can protect ecosystems. Second, the term 'ecosystem health' is ill-defined and associated with an outmoded, superorganismic view of the ecosystem. Third, ecosystem management seems focused on processes and so would appear to permit losses of species so long as they did not greatly affect processes like nutrient-cycling. Fourth, ecosystem management is often implemented by adaptive management. This may make it difficult to study the underlying mechanisms driving an ecosystem and to know when an entirely new management approach is needed. Thus, some conservationists see ecosystem management as a Trojan horse that would allow continued environmental destruction in the name of modern resource management. The recognition that some ecosystems have keystone species whose activities govern the well-being of many other species suggests an approach that may unite the best features of single-species and ecosystem management. If we can identify keystone species and the mechanisms that cause them to have such wide-ranging impacts, we would almost certainly derive information on the functioning of the entire ecosystem that would be useful in its management. Some keystone species themselves may be appropriate targets for management, but, even when they are not, our understanding of the ecosystem will be greatly increased. Keystone species may not be a panacea, however. We do not yet know how many ecosystems have keystone species, and the experiments that lead to their identification are often very difficult.

	abstract = {1. Recent efforts to understand how the patterning of interaction strength affects both structure and dynamics in food webs have highlighted several obstacles to productive synthesis. Issues arise with respect to goals and driving questions, methods and approaches, and placing results in the context of broader ecological theory. 2. Much confusion stems from lack of clarity about whether the questions posed relate to community-level patterns or to species dynamics, and to what authors actually mean by the term 'interaction strength'. Here, we describe the various ways in which this term has been applied and discuss the implications of loose terminology and definition for the development of this field. 3. Of particular concern is the clear gap between theoretical and empirical investigations of interaction strengths and food web dynamics. The ecological community urgently needs to explore new ways to estimate biologically reasonable model coefficients from empirical data, such as foraging rates, body size, metabolic rate, biomass distribution and other species traits. 4. Combining numerical and analytical modelling approaches should allow exploration of the conditions under which different interaction strengths metrics are interchangeable with regard to relative magnitude, system responses, and species identity. 5. Finally, the prime focus on predator-prey links in much of the research to date on interaction strengths in food webs has meant that the potential significance of non-trophic interactions, such as competition, facilitation and biotic disturbance, has been largely ignored by the food web community. Such interactions may be important dynamically and should be routinely included in future food web research programmes.},

	volume = {75},
	abstract = {One of the major questions in ecology is, what controls the structure of communities? We used projection matrix models to examine community dynamics and patterns of succession. The inputs of the model are transition probabilities of species replacements that were measured repeatedly during a long-term (1962-1989) study of diverse coral assemblages on Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef. Transitions varied strikingly among species and sites, reflecting differences in recruitment, growth, longevity (persistence), and the rate of replacement of one species by another. Species that had a poor ability to persist (e.g., algae and Pocilloporid corals) were generally good colonists. The observed number of transitions expressed as a proportion of the maximum number possible provides an index of the complexity of interactions in an assemblage, analogous to the concept of connectance in food-web analysis. Transitions occurred to and from nearly every species group, indicating that there was no competitive dominant in this system. We use the models in simulations to track transitory changes in species abundance and community composition following a major disturbance (e.g., due to a cyclone or outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish). Some species showed a rapid initial increase followed by a decline to lower equilibrium levels, while others increased smoothly to a generally higher equilibrial abundance. The length of time required to reach a climax assemblage using the same matrix recurrently (approximate to 20 yr) is far greater than the observed interval between major disturbances, supporting nonequilibrium theories of coral reef communities. Climax assemblages were highly diverse and varied in composition from site to site. The ''intermediate disturbance hypothesis'' does not fully predict successional changes in these shallow-water coral assemblages since diversity remained very high at equilibrium (i.e., long after a major disturbance), Competitively inferior species were not eliminated because routine mortality ensured that some space always remained available for colonization. We also present a novel method for quantifying the relative importance of each species interaction to community composition and the rate of succession, based on a sensitivity analysis of the transition matrix. The analysis shows that the importance of a species to the dynamics of a community may be unrelated to its abundance at equilibrium, with some rare species groups having a greater impact than more common ones. Sensitivity analysis of this type will provide a powerful means of identifying ''keystone'' species in complex assemblages where experimental manipulation of each species is impossible.},

Migration via wind currents is one mechanism by which invasion of new species may occur. Here, we describe immigration of the non-resident migratory moth, Plutella xylostella, into Svalbard during 2000. This was associated with a warm southeasterly air mass that crossed from W. Russia: moths appear to have covered the 800 km to Svalbard in under 48 h, flying at an altitude between 500 and 1500 m. These events thus provide a case study for wind-dispersed movements of invertebrates to high Arctic regions. Climate change scenarios predict increased frequency of such air masses and also of the warm dry weather associated with increased aerial insect transport.

	abstract = {Asymmetry in the competition abilities between invasive and native consumers can potentially influence the colonization success by invasive species. We tested whether a subsidy of allochthonous prey enhanced an asymmetric competition between invasive bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and two native cyprinid fish, that is, stone moroko (Pseudorasbora parva) and tamoroko (Gnathopogon elongatus elongatus). A field experiment was conducted using enclosures wherein the strength of interspecific competition and the presence/absence of allochthonous prey were manipulated. The experiment revealed that allochthonous prey alleviated the limitation of fish growths caused by a severe competition for aquatic prey resources. However, the importance of allochthonous prey differed considerably between invasive bluegill and the two native cyprinids. Individual bluegills grew faster when the allochthonous prey was supplied, whereas no difference in growth was observed in the two cyprinids whether or not allochthonous prey was supplied. Interestingly, the importance of allochthonous prey on the total amount of bluegill growth varied depending on the numerical abundance of native cyprinid competitors, and this importance increased when the native cyprinids were abundant. These findings indicated that allochthonous prey provides an asymmetric growth benefit to invasive bluegills over the two native cyprinids by alleviating asymmetrically the competition strength in a Japanese pond, especially under the conditions of severe interspecific resource competition and a limitation in the utilization of in situ prey resources.},

	volume = {102},
	abstract = {Because human actions alter the physical nature of aquatic ecosystems similarly worldwide, the extinction risk among many freshwater fishes that share particular life-history traits may also be similar. Determining whether taxonomic selectivity, the preferential loss (or persistence) of certain species groups, exists among the world's freshwater fish families is then a key step in predicting future species declines and triaging future conservation efforts. We use binomial statistics to look for taxonomic patterns among the world's freshwater fish families currently at risk of extinction. Families are identified as being at risk of extinction if at least one species within a given family is classified as either extinct or at risk of extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Redlist of Threatened Animals [Groombridge, B., Baillie, J., 1997. 1996 IUCN Red list of Threatened Animals. IUCN Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK]. Eighteen freshwater families have more threatened species than expected if extinction risk was evenly distributed across all families. Next, we use a series of chi-squared analyses to determine if various family-level characteristics (e.g. geographic distribution, body length, habitat preference, etc.) produce this taxonomic pattern. We find that families that inhabit well-studied regions of the world contain more threatened species. However, we find no indication of a unifying set of extinction-promoting biological or ecological traits that contribute to extinction risk among freshwater families. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that aquatic alterations worldwide are so severe that extinction is being driven by extrinsic rather than intrinsic factors.

We assessed the effect of habitat fragmentation by damming on the population persistence of a stream-dwelling fish, the white-spotted charr (Salvelinus leucomaenis), in streams of southwestern Hokkaido, Japan. We sampled for charr at 52 dammed-off sites by electrofishing or snorkeling and measured five habitat characteristics: isolation period, watershed area, gradient, elevation, distance from sea. Of the 52 study sites above dams, white-spotted charr were absent at 17 sites and were present at 35 sites. Because the charr occupied all undammed upstream reaches, the damming would cause the absence of charr upstream. Among five habitat characteristics examined, stepwise logistic-regression analysis showed that disappearance was promoted with increasing isolation period, with decreasing watershed area (i.e., habitat size), and with decreasing gradient. The resulting logistic model explained 82.7\% of the present white-spotted charr occurrence and forecasted that 12 of 35 extant populations will disappear after 50 years. Our findings imply that extirpation of small, dammed-off populations is inevitable unless efficient fish ladders are installed or dams are removed.},

An example is the tendency, seen in both fossil and modem data, for higher taxa living in marine habitats to have generally lower species extinction rates. At lower taxononomic levels, recent bird and mammal extinctions are concentrated in certain genera and families. A fundamental result of such selectivity is that it can accelerate net loss of biodiversity compared to random loss of species among taxa.

To explore the feasibility of basing conservation action on community-level biogeography, we sampled a montane insect community. We addressed three issues: (1) the appropriate scale for sampling insect communities; (2) the association of habitat specialization-perhaps a measure of extinction vulnerability-with other ecological or physical traits; and (3) the correlation of diversity across major insect groups. Using malaise traps in Gunnison County, Colorado, we captured 8847 Diptera (identified to family and morphospecies), 1822 Hymenoptera (identified to morphospecies), and 2107 other insects (identified to order). We sampled in three habitat types-meadow, aspen, and conifer-defined on the basis of the dominant vegetation at the scale of hundreds of meters. Dipteran communities were clearly differentiated by habitat type rather than geographic proximity. This result also holds true for hymenopteran communities. Body size and feeding habits were associated with habitat specialization at the family level. In particular, habitat generalists at the family level-taxa perhaps more likely to survive anthropogenic habitat alteration-tended to be trophic generalists. Dipteran species richness was marginally correlated with hymenopteran species richness and was significantly correlated with the total number of insect orders sampled by site. Because these correlations result from differences in richness among habitat types, insect taxa may be reasonable surrogates for one another when sampling is done across habitat types. In sum, community-wide studies appear to offer a practical way to gather information about the diversity and distribution of little-known taxa.},

	title = {Rarity, specialization and extinction in primates},
	volume = {29},
	abstract = {Aim To determine and explain biological traits that distinguish rare from common primate taxa. Location Africa, Americas, Asia, Madagascar. Methods We compare the biology of rare primate taxa with the biology of common taxa. Rarity is defined by (1) small size of geographic range; (2) small geographic range plus low local population density; and (3) small geographic range plus low local density plus narrow habitat specificity. After a linear comparison of size of geographic range with various biological traits, globally and by realm, extremes of rarity and commonness per realm are identified, and then combined for a global analysis. Tests are done both with genera treated as independent data points (n=62), and also with phylogenetic control by use of an independent contrasts test. Extinction risk in vertebrates, including primates, often correlates with high resource requirements, slow population recovery rate, and specialization. The three indices of rarity are therefore compared with these three general traits. Measures of resource use are body mass, local density, annual range size, and group size; of recovery rate, interbirth interval, and maximum intrinsic rate of natural population increase; and of degree of specialization, variety of diet, of habitats, maximum latitude, and morphological variety. All data come from the literature. Because several measures are compared, probabilities are Bonferroni corrected. Results If rarity in primates correlates with any biological attribute, it consistently correlates with only measures of specialization, and not with measures of high resource use, or slow population recovery rate. Without phylogenetic correction, the first two indices of rarity associate significantly with all four measures of specialization, and the third with maximum latitude. With phylogenetic correction, the first index still associates with all four, the second with two (maximum latitude, number of species per genus), and the third shows no significant associations. While the four measures of specialization are strongly interrelated, stepwise regressions on geographic range indicate that maximum latitude has the strongest effect, followed by dietary variety and number of species per genus and, finally, habitat variety. Main conclusions The most commonly demonstrated traits of susceptibility to extinction are those of high resource use, slow recovery rate, and specialization. Yet, while rarity (almost however, it is defined) is an inevitable precursor to extinction, specialization is the only trait found to correlate with rarity in this study. We cannot explain this apparent contradiction.},

Here, we use a database of 145 Australian marsupial species to test the effects of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors in a multivariate comparative approach. We model five intrinsic (body size, habitat specialization, diet, reproductive rate and range size) and four extrinsic (climate and range overlap with introduced foxes, sheep and rabbits) factors. We use quantitative measures of geographical range contraction as indices of decline. We also develop a new modelling approach of phylogenetically independent contrasts combined with imputation of missing values to deal simultaneously with phylogenetic structuring and missing data. One extrinsic variable-geographical range overlap with sheep-was the only consistent predictor of declines. Habitat specialization was independently but less consistently associated with declines. This suggests that extrinsic factors largely determine interspecific variation in extinction risk among Australian marsupials, and that the intrinsic factors that are consistently associated with extinction risk in other vertebrates are less important in this group.

We addressed this problem by calculating extinction rates for 35 species of turtles and squamates (lizards and snakes) occurring on 87 landbridge islands in the Mediterranean Sea. We calculated extinction rates in two ways: first, by incorporating the known sequence of historical island separations and second by ignoring history and assuming that the islands became isolated simultaneously. The second procedure is simpler and more frequently used in the literature and produces estimates of extinction rates that are similar to the first, more complex procedure. We then determined the relationship between extinction rates (calculated using both methods) and body mass, longevity, habitat specialization, and population abundance using two methods: first, by accounting for the phylogenetic relationships among species and, second, by ignoring them. Only population abundance and habitat specialization explained a significant amount of the observed variation in species extinction rates. Body mass itself did not explain variation in extinction rates, although it was strongly correlated with abundance. These conclusions were obtained using both procedures for calculating extinction rates and both procedures for correlating extinction rates with life-history traits.},

Mussel species richness increased in a downstream direction, and large-stream sites were characterized by a distinctive faunal assemblage that was similar between drainages. In contrast, faunal composition of headwater sites varied widely between drainages. Patterns of mussel community variation were correlated with patterns of fish community variation but not with habitat. Densities of host-specialist mussels with elaborate host-attracting mechanisms and host-generalist mussels were independent of host-fish densities, and these mussels were present throughout the drainages. Densities of host-specialist mussels without elaborate host-attracting mechanisms were correlated positively with host-fish densities and were absent or rare in headwater and midreach streams. We propose that mussel species dependent on host-fish density are restricted to sites with stable numbers of hosts, but mussels not dependent on host-fish density are able to persist in areas with more unstable fish assemblages, such as headwaters.},

Dispersal of mussels is dependent on the movement of fish hosts, a regional process, but growth and reproduction should be governed by local processes. Thus, mussel assemblage attributes should be predictable from the regional distribution and abundance of fishes. At a broad spatial scale in the Red River drainage, USA, mussel species richness and fish species richness were positively associated; maximum mussel richness was limited by fish richness, but was variable beneath that constraint. Measured environmental variables and the associated local fish assemblages each significantly accounted for the regional variation in mussel assemblages. Furthermore, mussel assemblages showed strong spatial autocorrelation. Variation partitioning revealed that pure fish effects accounted for 15.4\% of the variation in mussel assemblages: pure spatial and environmental effects accounted for 16.1\% and 7.8\%. respectively. Shared variation among fish, space and environmental variables totaled 40\%. Of this shared variation, 36.8\% was associated with the fish matrix. Thus. the variation in mussel assemblages that was associated with the distribution and abundance of fishes was substantial ( {\textgreater} 50\%), indicating that fish community structure is an important determinant of mussel community structure. Although animals commonly disperse plants and, thus, influence the structure of plant communities, our results show a strong macroecological association between two disparate animal groups with one strongly affecting the assemblage structure of the other.},

	abstract = {The nocturnally foraging cardinalfishes are known to exhibit a high degree of fidelity to their daytime resting sites. However, the microhabitats chosen as resting sites, the degree of specialisation on live coral substrata and the degree of overlap among apogonid species have not been described, These patterns potentially affect how declining coral availability will impact the diversity and abundance of apogonid assemblages. Here, microhabitat use, abundances and patterns of cooccurrence are examined for 10 common reef-dwelling apogonids in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. Nine of the 10 species were strongly associated with live scleractinian corals, with more than 80 \% of the individuals resting in branching forms. The exception was Apogon nigrofasciatus, a specialist on cave or crevice habitats. Among the available coral species, the vast majority of cardinalfishes were associated with a single coral species (Porites cylindrica), although the degree of specialisation varied among species. Apogon leptacanthus and Sphaeramia nematoptera were almost always only found on P. cylindrica, while Apogon bandanensis, Apogon compressus, Apogon fragilis, Archamia fucata, Archamia zosterophora, Cheilodipterus artus and C. quinquelineatus also used a range of other corals. There was a positive relationship between the range of substratum types used and the number of groups of each species observed. The 9 coral-dwelling apogonids exhibited a high degree of overlap in depth range and in the use of coral microhabitats. Over 75 \% of aggregations were made up of more than one fish species. The high level of both specialisation and overlap in habitat use suggests that the future biodiversity of cardinalfishes in Kimbe Bay could be linked to the fate of a single coral species.},

For postmetamorphic Bullfrogs, aquatic prey items dominated volumetrically. Prey size, diet volume and volumetric percentage of native frogs in diet increased with Bullfrog body size. The number and volumetric percentage of native frogs in the diet were not different for female and male Bullfrogs, and both were higher for adults than for juveniles. Diet overlap between males and juveniles was higher than that between males and females and between females and juveniles. Diet overlap with each native frog species of male Bullfrogs was lower than that of female Bullfrogs and juvenile Bullfrogs. We did not exam effects of Bullfrogs on native frogs but our results suggest that the primary threat posed by juvenile Bullfrogs to native frogs on Daishan Island is competition for food, whereas the primary threat posed by male Bullfrogs is direct predation. Female Bullfrogs may threaten native frogs by both competition and predation. These differences among Bullfrog groups may be attributed to differences in body size and microhabitat use.},

Predicting the risk of species extinctions from this type of habitat degradation is one of the most challenging and urgent tasks facing ecologists. Habitat specialists are thought to be more prone to extinction than generalists; however, specialists may be more susceptible to extinction because (1) they are specialists per se, (2) they are less abundant than generalists, or (3) both. Here, I show that declines in coral abundance lead to corresponding declines in the abundance of coral-dwelling fishes, but with proportionally greater losses to specialists than generalists. In addition, specialists have smaller initial population sizes than generalists. Consequently, specialists face a dual risk of extinction because their already small populations decline more rapidly than those of generalists. Corresponding with this increased extinction risk, I describe the local extinction of one specialist species and the near-global extinction of another species. I conclude that habitat specialists will be the first species lost from coral reefs because their small populations suffer the most from human-induced disturbances.},

In high-Andean Polylepis forests (3000-5000 m), two such species are the Giant Conebill (Oreomanes fraseri) and the Tawny Tit Spinetail (Leptasthenura yanacensis), two forest specialists confronted with the loss and fragmentation of their habitat. The high degree of habitat specialization with strong confinement to Polylepis forest patches predisposes them to a much lower threshold to habitat fragmentation than more generalist species. In this study, we examined their habitat use. Through the use of principal component analysis and generalized linear models considering the vegetation structure, tree density, ground cover and interior and edge plots, we found micro-habitat use only for O. fraseri. This species was more abundant (foraging and perching) in plots with high presence of mature trees. Also, both species showed strong edge avoidance, regardless of fragment size or vegetation characteristics. Adverse microclimate conditions, such as extreme temperatures during warm or cold periods at edges may be the most probable cause of edge avoidance. The reduction of edge:interior ratio within Polylepis fragments and management measures against mature tree cutting is suggested for the conservation of these two near threatened Andean birds.

The number of endemic finfish species in the region was 559, belonging to 47 families. Families Cyprinidae and Balitoridae accounted for 43.5\% and 16.2\% of the total number of endemic species in the region, respectively, followed by Sisoridae (25), Gobiidae (20), Melanotaeniidae (19), and Bagridae (16), and the other 41 families had at least one endemic species. Nation-wise the most number of endemic freshwater finfish species occur in India (191), followed by China (88), Indonesia (84), and Myanmar (60). In India, the endemic species accounted for 26.4\% of the native freshwater fish fauna, followed by South Korea (16.9\%), the Philippines, (16.3\%) and Myanmar (15.7\%). Statistically significant relationships discerned between the number of indigenous and endemic species richness to land area (X-la in 10(3) km(2)) of the nations in the region were, Y-in = 218.961 Ln(X-la) - 843.1 (R-2 = 0.735; P {\textless} 0.001) and Y-e = 28.445 Ln X-la -134.47 (R-2 = 0.534; P {\textless} 0.01), respectively, and between indigenous and endemic species richness was Y-e = 0.079X(n) - 1.558 (R-2 = 0.235; P {\textless} 0.05). The overall conservation status of endemic finfish in Asia was satisfactory in that only 92 species were in some state of vulnerability, of which 37 species (6.6\%) are endangered or critically endangered. However, the bulk of these species (83.7\%) were cave- and or lake-dwelling fish. However, nation-wise, the endemic freshwater finfish fauna of the Philippines and Sri Lanka, based on the imperilment index, were found to be in a highly vulnerable state. Among river basins, the Mekong Basin had the highest number of endemic species (31.3\%).

	abstract = {The Red List can be used a gauging too] by conservationists to assess which species require focused conservation attention. Mapping the relative distributions of species, and identification of centers of richness, endemism and threat are a first step towards site-oriented conservation action. We use here a specially developed biodiversity index, based on three weighted sub-components assigned to each species: geographical distribution, Red List status, and sensitivity to habitat change. We test this approach using what is called here the Dragonfly Biotic Index (DBI) to prioritize sites for conservation action, with special emphasis on species occurrence in three global hotspots in southern Africa. Using a selected set of the 23 top prioritized sites, we compare the DBI's performance to that of a rarity-complementarity algorithm. As with several other taxa, local endemism levels are highest in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), while richness is highest in the north east, particularly in the stream systems of the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany (MPA) hotspot. Red Listed Odonata species are also concentrated in the CFR, while richness is highest in the MPA hotspot. Site prioritization using the DBI reveals that CFR sites protect Red Listed taxa rather well, despite the fact that catchments are only partially protected. The DBI demonstrates high levels of redundancy in representing Red Listed species, in other words, the same species are represented in several catchments. The value in the DBI thus lies in maximizing redundancy (i.e. representation) of globally Red Listed species. The rarity-complementarity algorithm represents all species, but without greater emphasis on the rare and threatened (i.e. Red Listed) species. We conclude that the DBI is of great value in selecting biodiversity hotspots, while the algorithm is useful for selecting complementarity hotspots. We identify protection gaps and thus recommend continued searches in centers of endemism and existing reserves, as well as gap areas. These searches will hone Red List assessments and identify priority sites, as well as monitor already-identified sites for changes in quality of habitat. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Mortality rates of bitterling embryos in mussels were strongly density dependent and the strength of density dependence varied significantly among mussel species, Female preferences for mussels matched survival rates of embryos within mussels and females distributed their eggs among mussels such that embryo mortalities conformed to the predictions of an ideal free distribution model. Thus, female oviposition choice is adaptive and minimizes individual embryo mortality.},

	abstract = {In many taxa females appear to base their mate choice on multiple traits. But the relative importance of different traits in mate choice has rarely been determined. Here we show that females of a freshwater fish. the European bitterling, Rhodeus sericeus, base their mate choice on multiple traits that differ in their reliability as indicators of expected reproductive success and are used at different stages of the decision process, The initial decision to inspect a male is based on male behavior and red coloration, whereas the final spawning decision is based on the quality of the live unionid mussel, Anodonta anatina, that the male is defending as an oviposition site. Male traits may indicate which males are worth inspecting by reflecting male quality, such as reproductive condition and genetic constitution. Male traits do not, however, reflect mussel quality as bright males also court females vigorously toward mussels that yield a low probability of survival of the offspring. Females, on the other hand. are choosier than males in their choice of spawning site and seem to gain reliable information about the survival probability of the eggs by inspecting the mussel directly.},

	abstract = {In most species, males attack other males that attempt to gain fertilizations through sneak copulations. Here we report on a system where dominant males show a low level of aggression against sneakers at the initial stages of territory establishment. Females of the Europe,in bitterling, Rhodeus sericeus, lay their eggs in living mussels and males fertilize the eggs by releasing sperm over the mussels both before and after egg laying. When we allowed males to court females to a mussel containing no eggs at different male densities - one, two, four, or six males - the dominant male showed a low level of aggression against other males that released sperm. The dominant male became aggressive toward the other males only after eggs had been laid. This unusual pattern could be due to either some benefit of accepting sneakers or a high cost of aggression. We found support for both possibilities. The presence of several males decreased the time until a female spawned, whereas increased aggression by the dominant male against other males during a second female presentation, when the male was more territorial, interrupted courtship and increased the time until spawning. Females appeared to be attracted by both the presence of several males around a mussel and increased courtship under male competition. The bitterling mating system possibly differs from that of other species due to lack of investment in nest building and parental care, and high costs of defending the spawning site against sneakers.},

Counts investigated were taken from population samples at 23 localities covering an area of about 68 degrees geographical longitude (2 degrees 40 W - 49 degrees 30 E and 128 degrees 00 E - 143 degrees 00 E), and about 15 degrees geographical latitude (37 degrees 30 N - 52 degrees 00 N). Al three characters manifested a distinct clinal variation. LL, SQU and SPBR closely followed the species' essentially longitudinal distribution. The number of segments was also related to latitude, elevation, mean annual air temperature and fish size. Bergmann's rule was fully demonstrated for fishes and at the species level. Local regional differences were found within particular regions, indicating the existence of subclines. Variation of truly isolated populations seems to be predictable and dependent on the dines found in adjacent populations. None of the counts investigated, including a key character (number of pored scales in LL), can be used to distinguish amarus from sericeus. Owing to sufficient evidence that meristic and morphometric characters used to distinguish fish subspecies succumb to the clinal variation controlled by various factors, the concept of subspecies and trinomial nomenclature is inefficient, superfluous and misleading, and should be excluded from taxonomy, nomenclature and ecology.},

In order to elucidate the genetic sex determination system of the rosy bitterling, two kinds of gynogenesis were carried out: retention of the second polar body (GRSPB) and suppression of the first cleavage (GSFC). The sex ratio of progeny was nearly 7:1 (male:female) for both GRSPB and GSFC, while those of control and parental fish were almost 1:1. In backcrosses of female progeny by GRSPB and normal diploid males, male progeny were observed at low frequency (one or two individuals in each experiment), except in one experiment where the appearance rate of males was about 50\%. From results of gynogenesis and backcrosses, the following conclusions can be made. The genetic sex determination system of the rosy bitterling is a heterogametic female system (ZW). Survival rate of super-females (WW), produced by gynogenesis, is much lower than that of males (ZW). There is a possibility that crossovers between sex determining genes and a centromere occur in the first meiosis. With repect to the mechanism of unisexuality (male) of artificial triploids of the rosy bitterling, only males (ZZZ and ZZW) are presumed viable, while females (ZWW) are probably inviable.},

These species are involved in an unusual symbiosis, with the fish depositing eggs inside the mussels' gills, where the embryos develop for 3-6 weeks until the larvae leave the mussel, 2. High concentrations of phosphate (500 mu g L-1 and higher) caused a significant increase in the rate of premature expulsion and emergence of bitterling embryos from the mussels, with a concomitant increase in fish mortality. 3. At concentrations of 750 mu g L-1 and higher, mussels reduced their frequency of ventilation and movements through the substratum. 4. These results have implications for understanding the nature of the symbiosis between the fish and their mussel hosts, showing that mussels have control over bitterling developing in their gills. The premature expulsion of bitterling embryos at high phosphate levels is detrimental to the fish that they harbour. 5. Recommendations for the conservation of bitterling and species of mussels, which are threatened or endangered over parts of their ranges, include reductions in levels of phosphorus in natural habitats and the need for low levels in reintroduction sites for the fish and their mussel hosts.},

Partial cannibalism was shown to be common, and males were found to remove developing embryos from throughout a clutch in a random pattern, rather than in the more aggregated pattern seen during embryo predation. Males that received a diet supplement grew faster than control males, but did not engage in less cannibalism. Also, males did not concentrate cannibalism on early embryonic stages with the highest energetic value. Experimental reduction of embryo densities was found to significantly increase embryo development rate and survival from egg deposition to hatching, and experimental reduction of oxygen levels significantly increased rates of partial filial cannibalism by males. Artificial spawning sites with low oxygen levels were avoided by spawning females, and cannibalism rates by males were higher.

We experimentally manipulated spawning-site abundance and male density at two spatial scales. We showed that the total number of eggs spawned by females was constrained by the number of mussels available for oviposition. The effect was mediated by behavioral interactions among competing males because of variation in the Operational Sex Ratio (OSR) in close proximity to a mussel and not by a direct limitation in mussel capacity to accommodate the eggs. Both total and local male densities affected spawning behavior, and interacted in their effect on female spawning rate. Territorial male aggression caused courtship interruptions that prolonged the time until successful spawning and increased with male density. However, territoriality broke down at the highest male density, with a consequent stabilizing effect on spawning rate.},

In the second model, males cannibalised a fixed proportion of each clutch to varying degrees. In the final model, males did not engage in filial cannibalism. Our model for males that were able to track environmental conditions showed a good fit to empirical data, and this model proved the most successful male strategy in response to variability in spawning rate, water temperature and clutch size.

While the success of territorial males declined with male density, the success of individual sneaking males remained constant across densities. Notably, the capacity of territorial males to outcompete sneakers by preoviposition sperm loading was the best predictor of male reproductive success, rather than aggression, body size or postoviposition ejaculation.},

They also monopolised pair spawnings with females, releasing 98\% of all sperm clouds during mating.

Females spawned at equal rates in the two densities of males, despite lower courtship at high density.

Reduced concentrations of algae and oxygen each led to a greater proportion of bitterling embryos being ejected prematurely from the mussel hosts. Reduced algal concentrations also led to reductions in mussel ventilation rates and to mussels spending less time with their valves open. Bitterling mortality may have been due to three causes: direct effects of environmental conditions on embryonic survival, active expulsion by mussels when stressed and through responses by mussels that created internal conditions that bitterling embryos could not survive.

We experimentally separated intrasexual (male-male interference competition) and intersexual (female choice) components of sexual selection in a freshwater fish, the European bitterling (Rhodeus sericeus). We compared the roles of multiple morphological and behavioural traits in male success in both components of sexual competition, and their relation to male reproductive success, measured as paternity of offspring. Body size was important for both female choice and male-male competition, though females also preferred males that courted more vigorously. However, dominant males often monopolized females regardless of female preference. Subordinate males were not excluded from reproduction and sired some offspring, possibly through sneaked ejaculations. Male dominance and a greater intensity of carotenoid-based red colouration in their iris were the best predictors of male reproductive success. The extent of red iris colouration and parasite load did not have significant effects on female choice, male dominance or male reproductive success. No effect of parasite load on the expression of red eye colouration was detected, though this may have been due to low parasite prevalence in males overall. In conclusion, we showed that even though larger body size was favoured in both intersexual and intrasexual selection, male-male interference competition reduced opportunities for female choice. Females, despite being choosy, had limited control over the paternity of their offspring.

The lowest survival was from late May to July (0\%). Losses of bitterling embryos from mussels were identified by ejections from the mussel host. Ejections were categorized as either ejections of live embryos, or ejections of embryos that died in the mussel and were subsequently expelled from the mussel. Ejection rates of live embryos were higher in the earlier part of the spawning period (early-mid April) and dead embryo ejections in the later period (after June). The ejection rate of live embryos was higher among younger embryos earlier in the season, probably because of the incomplete development of morphological and behavioural traits associated with maintaining the embryo inside the mussel gill chambers, and as a consequence of a more protracted developmental period at low temperatures making them more susceptible to ejection. The ejection rate of dead embryos was higher in older embryos later in the season, and in larger mussels and at high embryo densities. The survival of embryos in mussels was probably related to oxygen availability, with mortalities probably caused by asphyxiation. Increased embryo mortalities may arise through competition among embryos, between embryos and mussel, and ambient dissolved oxygen levels. The optimal period for bitterling to spawn may represent a balance between two opposing factors; with positive and negative effects of a seasonal rise in temperature directly affecting embryonic growth rate and oxygen availability.},

	abstract = {Environmental and population parameters that influence the strength of sexual selection may vary considerably over the course of the reproductive season. However, the potential for sexual selection frequently fails to translate into variation in reproductive success among individuals. We investigated seasonal changes in variation in reproductive success, measured as the opportunity for sexual selection, using parentage analysis in 20 experimental populations of the European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus, Cyprinidae), a small freshwater fish with a promiscuous, resource-based mating system. We showed that although the largest males sired most offspring over the entire reproductive season, variation in reproductive success and hence the opportunity for sexual selection was low at the start of the season but increased significantly at its end. This seasonal difference probably arose from the superior competitive endurance of large males and from a higher temporal clustering of reproductively active females at the start of the breeding season than later in the season. The spatial distribution of oviposition sites had a negligible effect on the variation in reproductive success. We discuss the potential implications of our results for the importance and strength of sexual selection in natural populations.},

Our results showed that, in both species, territorial males adjusted their effort in nest guarding to the presence of rival sneakers by increasing the time spent patrolling the territory and attacking the sneakers. In contrast, sperm expenditure and male courtship rate were not influenced by the number of attending sneakers. These results are in agreement with those reported for other fish with alternative mating tactics and help to interpret previous inconsistencies between theoretical predictions and measured levels of sperm released at different levels of sperm competition by sneakers of the two gobiids studied here.},

This relationship has hitherto been thought mutualistic, on the premise that R. sericeus use mussels as foster parents of their embryos while mussels use R. sericeus as hosts for their larvae. We demonstrate that R. sericeus is a parasite of European mussels, because it (i) avoids the cost of infection by mussel larvae and (ii) imposes a direct cost on mussels. Our experiments also indicate a potential coevolutionary arms race between bitterling fishes and their mussel hosts; the outcome of this relationship may differ between Asia, the centre of distribution of bitterling fishes, and Europe where they have recently invaded.},

The reproductive ecology and pattern of mussel utilization of four sympatric species of bitterling, Acheilognathus rhombeus, A. tabira tabira, Tanakia lanceolata, and T. limbata, were investigated in a lowland river with seven sympatric mussel species. Three bitterling species are spring spawners with overlapping spawning seasons. A. rhombeus is an autumn-spawning species and is temporally isolated in its reproduction from the other species. Ovipositor length during oviposition of T. limbata and T. lanceolata was short, while those of A. tabira tabira and A. rhombeus were long. Most T. limbata inhabited near-shore areas, whereas the two other spring-spawning species were distributed across the entire river. All bitterling species used Inversidens brandti, Obovalis omiensis and Inversiunio jokohamensis as spawning hosts, but not the other mussel species available. T. lanceolata, A. tabira tabira and A. rhombeus showed spawning preferences for O. omiensis and I. brandti. However, T. limbata did not show clear preferences for any of the mussel species they used. A. t. tabira showed a significant preference for large I. brandti in offshore areas, while the other spring-spawning bitterling showed a preference for mussels inshore.

These data were compared to the historic data from 1936-1998 as recorded in the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's digital database, Albany, NY. Only 6 freshwater species reported in the historic data - Rhodeus sericeus (Bitterling), Salmo trutta (Brown Trout), Semotilus corporalis (Fallfish), Esox americanus vermiculatus (Grass Pickerel), Etheostoma nigrum (Johnny Darter), and Esox lucius (Northern Pike) - are no longer in the river. However, the original report of the presence of the Johnny Darter probably resulted from taxonomic confusion since this species has never been in the Hudson Valley, and we strongly believe that the report of the presence of grass pickerel is also the result of misidentification of the specimen for the same reason as given for the johnny darter. The report of the Brown Trout should be discounted since this species has been only taken in the Bronx River following a stocking event. We have found a breeding population of Brown Trout in the southern end of Davis Brook, but these have not yet traversed the multi-channel marsh area to enter the Bronx River proper. Therefore, only three previously reported species - Bitterling, Fallfish, and Northern Pike-are no longer in the river. Four species-Fundulus diaphanus (Banded Killifish), Ameiurus nebulosus (Brown Bullhead), Apeltes quadracus (Fourspine Stickleback), and Micropterus dolomieu (Smallmouth Bass) - not reported in the historic database were part of our 2001-2005 freshwater collection. These discrepancies are explained, and on balance, it was determined that for the past 70 years, the Bronx River has been remarkably stable in terms of fish species and diversity. Examination of the estuarine portion of the river shows that it functions as an important nursery ground for many commercial and recreational fish harvested from New York waters.},

We did not detect any effect of resource distribution on offspring production or variation in reproductive success among individual fish, although variation between replicates was higher with a clumped distribution. This finding is discussed with regard to the incidence of alternative mating behaviors (sneaking) within the limitations imposed by our experimental design. Breeding resource distribution had a significant effect on selection on male phenotypic traits. Stronger directional selection on traits associated with intrasexual competition for fertilizations, gonad mass (an indicator of sperm competition), and the extent of red, carotenoid-based pigment in the iris (an index of dominance status), was detected with a clumped resource distribution. With a regular resource distribution, a stronger positive selection on male body size was detected. We discuss the implications of our results for natural populations.},

Three experimental mating trials were conducted using males of known dominance rank, but with different levels of constraint on male behavior. Thus, females were able to choose among; (1) males that were isolated from each other; (2) males that could see and smell each other, but could not directly interact; (3) males that could interact fully. Using a combination of behavioral observation and parentage analyses it was shown that female preferences did not correspond with male dominance and that male aggression and dominance constrained female mate choice, resulting in a potential intersexual conflict. The survival of offspring to independence was significantly correlated with female mate preferences, but not with male dominance. A lack of strong congruence in female preference for males suggested a role for parental haplotype compatibility in mate choice.},

Using females of the damselfly Hetaerina americana, I first investigated whether male harassment affected female mating rate and survival and explored whether such effects induced a resource allocation from immunity (in the form of phenoloxidase activity) and muscular fat reserves to egg number and size. Using two seasons that differed in male harassment, it was found that the higher the male harassment, the fewer are the female matings and the lower is the female survival. These results were corroborated using an experimental approach in which a situation of high male harassment was induced. It was also found that when the first mating takes place and at high male harassment, females had more reduced phenoloxidase activity and fat reserves and tended to lay most of the eggs they produce in their lifetime and these were considerably large. However, at low male harassment, egg number and size were more equally produced across matings. Females under high male harassment seemed to suffer the survival costs but may show a plastic evolutionary response of reallocating resources to egg traits to maximize fitness.},

Exposure to rival males prior to mating increased a male's ejaculate investment ( measured as mating duration); by contrast, exposure to rival males in the mating arena decreased mating duration. The results therefore suggested that SC intensity is important in shaping male responses to SC in this system, although the patterns were not strictly in accord with existing theory. We then tested whether males that responded to the level of SC had higher reproductive fitness in a competitive context. We found that males kept with rivals prior to mating again mated for longer; furthermore, they achieved significantly higher paternity share regardless of whether they were the first or second males to mate with a female. The plastic strategies employed by males therefore resulted in significantly increased reproductive success in a competitive context, even following subsequent rematings in which the majority of sperm were displaced.},

A previously published field study on a population of the maternally mouthbrooding cichlid fish Ctenochromis horei in the north of Lake Tanganyika suggested mate monopolization by the most dominant male. In the present study, genetic reconstructions of paternity in a population in the south of the lake provided no evidence for male mate monopolization, as none of the inferred sires had offspring in more than one brood. The ability to reconstruct sire genotypes from offspring alleles was confirmed by computer simulations. Multiple paternity occurred in several broods and was significantly more frequent in the sample taken in the rainy season than in the dry season sample (100\% of broods vs. 14\%, respectively; P = 0.005). The data suggest geographical and temporal variation in the mating behaviour of C. horei despite its continuous year-round reproduction, invariable brood care behaviour and habitat-specific distribution in the relatively constant and confined environment of a tropical lake. Moreover, our data show that inferences on the distribution of male reproductive success, if based on each geographical or temporal data set alone, would fail to describe the potential for sexual selection in this species.},

These factors indicate that Hymenoptera are the most effective pollinators and the major contributors to C. libanotis reproductive success. Nevertheless, considering the insect species, a dipteran, the syrphid Eristalis tenax appears to be more effective than some Hymenoptera on the basis of its C. libanotis-pollen carrying ability. Fluorescent dust dispersal indicated that the neighborhood area for pollen dispersal was different among stands and could change during the flowering season.

Isolation of islets and patches had no significant effect on the response variables (seed set and bumble bee activity). However, the isolation of islets and patches was quite small compared to the activity range of bumble bees in the study area. While islet size seemed to be unimportant, both pollinator activity and seed set increased with increasing patch and tussock size, whereas the frequency of aborted seeds decreased. The increased seed set of larger and presumably older patches and tussocks indicate that to maximize viability of a fragmented, perennial herb population, it is important to minimize local disturbance so that individual subpopulations may develop over time.},

I examined the effect of habitat fragmentation on reproduction of four species found in mallee woodlands of central New South Wales, Australia: Acacia brachybotrya, Senna artemisioides, Eremophila glabra, and Dianella revoluta. At six sites I surveyed plants in a reserve and in a nearby linear strip of vegetation. Two additional sites were established in a large reserve. Many effects were apparent at the extreme end of fragmentation, revealed by two-way analysis of covariance comparing reserves and linear strips at each site. The nature of the response differed among species. Flower production was greater in most linear strip fragments for S. artemisioides and E. glabra. Fruit set efficiency was significantly greater in linear strips for S. artemisioides and significantly lower for A. brachybotrya, E. glabra, and D. revoluta. Fruit predation was lower in most linear strips for E. glabra. For A. brachybotrya, fruit predation was significantly lower in linear strips. The net effect of these changes was a significant increase in whole-plant seed production for S. artemisioides, a significant decrease in whole-plant seed production for A. brachybotrya and in whole-plant fruit production for D. revoluta, and no consistent effect on whole-plant fruit production for E. glabra. In contrast, the only pattern apparent when the effect of fragment size was considered over a range from linear strips {\textless}40 m wide to a reserve {\textgreater}140,000 ha was a positive correlation between the fragment size and fruit-set efficiency of A. brachybotrya.

	abstract = {The effectiveness of the common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) as a pollinator of the rainforest tree Syzygium cormiflorum was assessed by comparing movements: pollen loads, and visitation frequency, with those of birds. The study was carried out in a fragmented rainforest landscape in north Queensland and movements were determined by radio-telemetry. Bars carried 6 times more pollen than birds, but were less frequent visitors to S. cormiflorum, suggesting that the quantity of pollen distributed by the two groups may not differ greatly. However. pollen quality (the geographic genetic distance moved) may be a more important factor in determining pollinator effectiveness. Bats were very mobile in the fragmented landscape, with home ranges varying from 12 to 1796 ha and often encompassing more than one forest fragment. Bats usually moved along strips of vegetation, but were found to fly; up to 5.8 km (mean = 1 km) across cleared land. This mobility led to similar numbers of S. australis being caught in small ({\textless} 50 ha) forest fragments and continuous forest. At the scale of individual trees, bats fed for an average of 1.2 min per tree, compared to 5.0 min for birds. Short foraging rimes per tree and frequent movements of {\textgreater} 200 m should increase the opportunity for movement of pollen between individual trees. Collectively, these observations suggest that S, australis carry pollen of high quality. Although they fly across cleared land, fragmentation may impact bat populations by allowing increased owl predation in open country and by increasing the reliance of bats on flower resources in the agricultural matrix. On the Atherton Tablelands, the latter is provided mostly by cultivated bananas (Musa sp.), which produce nectar but not pollen. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In a fragmented, dry subtropical forest in northwestern Argentina, we compared pollination levels, fruit set, and seed set among small ({\textless}1 ha) forest fragments, large ({\textgreater}2 ha) fragments, and continuous forest in 16 plant species representing a wide range of pollination systems, breeding systems, and growth forms. For three species, Prosopis nigra (Mimosoideae), Cercidium australe (Caesalpinoideae), and Atamisquea emarginata (Capparaceae), the three treatments were replicated across four sites; we achieved less replication for other species. Because comparisons between forest and fragment populations for different species took place in different sites, however, by treating all 16 species as a unit we lessened the potential bias of confounding site effects and could evaluate the overall impact of fragmentation. Significant or marginal (P {\textless} .10) fragmentation-related declines in number of pollen tubes per style, fruit set, and seed set occurred in 9 of 16, 5 of 15, and 3 of 14 species, respectively. Overall, significant or nonsignificant declines occurred in 81\%(pollen tubes), 73\% (fruit set), and 79\% (seed set) of the species. In all cases these proportions were greater (P less than or equal to.06) than the null binomial expectation of a 1:1 ratio of increases to decreases. Breeding system did not explain sensitivity to fragmentation: the magnitudes of declines in pollen tubes, fruit set, and seed set were virtually indistinguishable between self-compatible and self-incompatible species. At least 4 of the 10 self-incompatible species, however, were heavily visited in small fragments by Africanized honey bees, which may have compensated for a decline in visits by native pollinators. The exact nature of responses varied among plant species. In some, the absolute quantity of pollen grains transferred to stigmas decreased with fragmentation, and sometimes this was reflected in reduced fruit or seed set. In Cercidium, Prosopis, and Atamisquea, the quality of the grains transferred apparently changed: number of pollen tubes produced per pollen grain on the stigma declined with increasing fragmentation, and at least in the latter two species seed production declined as well. Overall, levels of pollination and seed production undoubtedly integrated many idiosyncratic effects of fragmentation on particular plant and animal populations, and indicated that ''community health'' of fragments suffered in comparison with that of continuous forest. Median decreases in pollination levels and seed output from forest to fragments approached 20\%. The impact of these declines on plant recruitment is less clear, however, because cattle grazing and trampling of seedlings and saplings in fragments may constitute a much more serious short-term conservation problem.},

	title = {Hurricane causes resource and pollination limitation of fruit set in a bird-pollinated shrub},
	volume = {81},
	abstract = {Hurricanes can strip leaves from plants and provide other stresses that can reduce resource availability for subsequent reproduction. In addition, hurricanes commonly reduce populations of bird pollinators. I measured both resource and pollination limitation of fruit set for Bahama Swamp-bush (Pavonia bahamensis) on San Salvador Island in the Bahamas before and after two seasons of hurricanes. Before the hurricanes in the winter flowering season in 1994-1995, fruit set of P. bahamensis was 100\% for most shrubs. After a mild hurricane, in 1995-1996, fruit set was 48\%. After the severe Hurricane Lili (Category 2) in 1996-1997, mean fruit set was only 11\%. In both years after the hurricanes, lower fruit set reflected resource limitation. In 1996-1997 after Hurricane Lili, fruit set was severely reduced an additional 74\% by pollination limitation. Pollination limitation was caused by declines of the two bird pollinators, Bananaquits and Bahama Woodstars. In 1994-1995, both species were frequent visitors to flowers, but in 1996-1997 these birds were rarely seen on the island. A concurrent mist-netting study indicated that Bananaquit populations were decimated after Hurricane Lili in 1996. Nectar removal was virtually absent, and pollen deposition on stigmas was low. In 1994-1995, 98\% of the stigmas had received pollen by the end of floral life. In contrast, in 1996-1997, 51\% of the flowers had received no pollen, supporting the conclusion that pollination limitation of fruit set was strong. There was no compensatory pollination by other pollinators, either other bird species or insects. These results indicate that severe hurricanes can affect fruit set directly through resource limitation and indirectly through reducing bird pollinators and causing pollination limitation of fruit set. Reduced fruit set after a hurricane could be especially disadvantageous because hurricanes can create sites for plant recruitment. Although resource limitation of fruit set may affect many plant species, bird-pollinated species may be faced with a double jeopardy of resource limitation of fruit set and pollination limitation of fruit set. Whether this disadvantage affects the recruitment of bird-pollinated plants after hurricanes or their adaptations for recruiting after hurricanes remains to be examined.},

	volume = {159},
	abstract = {A growing body of evidence suggests that the costs and benefits involved in cleaning interactions can vary over space and time depending on the environmental conditions. However, whether the same cleaners actually induce variable net outcomes in terms of host fitness remains unclear to date. Branchiobdellid annelids are generally regarded as commensals or rarely parasites of their freshwater crayfish hosts, but a recent study suggests that they may also function as cleaning organisms. Under natural conditions, crayfish can experience fouling of the exposed surfaces of their exoskeletons and their gills (e.g., epibiosis) by various epibionts and particles of organic debris, and branchiobdellids graze on these sources of fouling. Here, we examined the extent to which variation in fouling pressure in the environment alters the outcome of the interaction between branchiobdellids and their crayfish host Cambaroide similis. A series of manipulations were performed in artificial environments designed to simulate either high or low fouling pressure. We used crayfish growth rates and mortality as direct measurements of the net costs and benefits of cleaning. Branchiobdellids had no significant effect on crayfish growth or mortality when cultured under low fouling pressure. However, their presence had a significant positive impact on host growth rates when cultured under high fouling pressure. These results suggest that the relationship between crayfish and branchiobdellids can fluctuate between commensalism and mutualism depending mainly on the environmental fouling pressure. We hypothesize that the outcome of cleaning interactions may largely depend on the factors directly related to the need for cleaning, such as parasite loads or fouling pressure.},

	volume = {29},
	abstract = {The pollination of flowering plants by animals represents a critical ecosystem service of great value to humanity, both monetary and otherwise. However, the need for active conservation of pollination interactions is only now being appreciated. Pollination systems are under increasing threat from anthropogenic sources, including fragmentation of habitat, changes in land use, modern agricultural practices, use of chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides, and invasions of non-native plants and animals. Honeybees, which themselves are non-native pollinators on most continents, and which may harm native bees and other pollinators, are nonetheless critically important for crop pollination. Recent declines in honeybee numbers in the United States and Europe bring home the importance of healthy pollination systems, and the need to further develop native bees and other animals as crop pollinators. The "pollination crisis" that is evident in declines of honeybees and native bees, and in damage to webs of plant-pollinator interaction, may be ameliorated not only by cultivation of a diversity of crop pollinators, but also by changes in habitat use and agricultural practices, species reintroductions and removals, and other means. In addition, ecologists must redouble efforts to study basic aspects of plant-pollinator interactions if optimal management decisions are to be made for conservation of these interactions in natural acid agricultural ecosystems.},

We examine plant-pollinator relationships as one example of a vital interaction that may be affected by fragmentation. All available evidence shows that pollinator abundance and diversity decline with fragmentation. For some plants, this decline causes reduced pollination and seed set. For both pollinators and plants, specialization for mutualistic partners appears to be a key characteristic that increases their risk of local extinction in fragments. For more generalized species, substitutability of available partners will be necessary for their success. However, relatively little evidence exists for evaluating the importance of these or other characteristics in causing species loss in fragments. Potentially, the loss of one mutualistic partner could cause cascading extinctions, but this process remains to be documented for plant-pollinator communities. More studies on the biologies of key plant-pollinator mutualisms would be valuable for habitat management and would also provide insights into how plant-pollinator interactions influence demographic and genetic processes.},

	volume = {22},
	abstract = {This review focuses on how predator performance of the invasive largemouth bass [Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede)] has been, or will be, formed in Japanese freshwaters. Predation impacts of largemouth bass on fish communities appear pervasive in both Japanese as well as North American freshwaters. Factors affecting performance as a piscivorous predator are (1) light intensity and water clarity, (2) oxygen depletion, (3) prey size and gape size, (4) behavioral refuge of prey, (5) weed beds as refuge for prey fish, (6) interaction with bluegill. Size and behavioral refuges requirements are so rigorous that they may have evolved only in some North American prey fish species like bluegill; therefore, most Japanese native fish species are unlikely to be equipped with such refuges. However, refuge habitats like aquatic weed beds could develop in Japanese freshwaters, allowing prey fish species to survive under predation pressure. The density, architecture, and species composition of aquatic plants may affect their suitability as refuges. Studies in Japanese waters have suggested that the presence of rich aquatic vegetation or invasive bluegill in bass-introduced waters have suppressed the predation impact of largemouth bass on fish communities. In addition to these environmental factors, original genotypic and phenotypic traits of the introduced largemouth bass, and hybridization between different lineages of largemouth bass or with Florida bass [Micropterus floridanus (Lesueur)] may be involved in further adaptation of invasive largemouth bass to Japanese freshwaters.},

	volume = {142},
	abstract = {The invasive signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) may undergo ontogenetic diet shifts with increasing size, but the consequences of crayfish size-structure changes for aquatic food webs are little known. We evaluated size-dependent impacts of signal crayfish on a littoral marsh food web using in-situ enclosures in a northern Japanese marsh. During the 60-day experiment, large crayfish ({\textless}30 mm orbital carapace length) rapidly eliminated submerged macrophytes through mechanical destruction while the comparable impacts of small crayfish ({\textgreater}30 mm) appeared after more time had passed. Benthic algal biomass was reduced in the presence of large crayfish but was affected little by small crayfish, suggesting that large crayfish were significant bioturbators. On the other hand, total invertebrate biomass was reduced while total invertebrate density was enhanced in the presence of both crayfish size classes. Potential crayfish impacts on invertebrates are: (1) predation on large vulnerable taxa such as Trichoptera and predatory (2) mechanical destruction of macrophytes, thereby reducing microhabitats for invertein-vertebrates, brates, (3) heightened emigration of invertebrates in response to bioturbation and/or (4) predation or competition release on small invertebrates as a result of crayfish reducing their predators/competitors. Invertebrate taxa richness was nearly halved in the presence of large crayfish, probably reflecting reductions of rare taxa. Overall, functional roles of signal crayfish as omnivores and ecosystem engineers remained similar during the ontogenetic stage but the magnitude and rate of crayfish impacts intensified with increasing crayfish size. Thus, removal of large invasive crayfish alone may reduce detrimental impacts on aquatic biodiversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	volume = {78},
	abstract = {This study investigated host specialisation in an unusual symbiosis between a species of fish, the European bitterling (Rhodeus sericeus: family Cyprinidae, subfamily Acheilognathinae), and four species of freshwater mussels (family Unionidae) which bitterlings use for spawning. A field study from a single site in England examined four aspects of host use. First, comparisons among mussel species showed significant differences in production of bitterling young: Unio pictorum released the most young fish, followed in order by Anodonta anatina, Unio tumidus, and Anodonta cygnea. These findings pertained to mussels which had received eggs naturally, and were repeated in an experiment in the wild which controlled for mussel density and prior occupancy by bitterling embryos. Second, there were no significant differences within species in host productivity according to mussel size for individuals {\textgreater}60 mm in length. Third, field manipulations indicated microhabitat differences in host use which depended on the mussel species: U. pictorum individuals were used most heavily when closest to the river bank, whereas the opposite trend occurred for U. tumidus and A. anatina. Finally, the total productivity of mussels which had been clustered in groups of three was three times higher than single individuals. This latter effect suggests a benefit to males from choosing to defend groups of mussels. Benefits from specialisation among mussel species are not clear, but host use may reflect the broader context of overlaps between the fish and mussels in habitats. The ranges of all four mussel species overlap widely with those of bitterlings, but the least-used mussel species, A. cygnea, has the least habitat overlap with bitterlings, suggesting the potential for weaker selection on the fish for host recognition or adaptation to this species.},

@article{light_distinguishing_2007,
	title = {Distinguishing between invasions and habitat changes as drivers of diversity loss among {California}'s freshwater fishes},
	volume = {21},
	abstract = {Many of California's native populations of freshwater fish are in serious decline, as are freshwater faunas worldwide. Habitat loss and alteration, hydrologic modification, water pollution, and invasions have been identified as major drivers of these losses. Because these potential causes of decline are frequently correlated, it is difficult to separate direct from indirect effects of each factor and to appropriately rank their importance for conservation action. Recently a few authors have questioned the conservation significance of invasions, suggesting that they are "passengers" rather than "drivers" of ecological change. We compiled an extensive, watershed-level data set of fish Presence and conservation status, land uses, and hydrologic modifications in California and used an information theoretic approach (Akaike's information criterion, AIC) and path analysis to evaluate competing models of native fish declines. Hydrologic modification (impoundments and diversions), invasions, and proportion of developed land were all predictive of the number of extinct and at-risk native fishes in California watersheds in the AIC analysis. Although nonindigenous fish richness was the best single predictor (after native richness) of fishes of conservation concern, the combined ranking of models containing hydrologic modification variables was slightly higher than that of models containing nonindigenous richness. Nevertheless, the path analysis indicated that the effects of both hydrologic modification and development on fishes of conservation concern were largely indirect, through their positive effects on nonindigenous fish richness. The best fitting path model was the driver model, which included no direct effects of abiotic disturbance on native fish declines. Our results suggest that, for California freshwater fishes, invasions are the primary direct driver of extinctions and population declines, whereas the most damaging effect of habitat alteration is the tendency of altered habitats to support nonindigenous fishes.},

	volume = {72},
	abstract = {1. Intraguild predation (IGP) has been studied extensively in predatory fish, amphibians and mammals, but less so in top avian predators. We studied the impact of IGP by large eagle owls Bubo bubo Linnaeus (body mass similar to1.5-4 kg) on diurnal black kites Milvus migrans Boddaert (similar to0.5-1 kg) in eight populations located in the Italian Alps. Eagle owls preyed on both adult and nestling kites, especially when kites nested within 2 km of an owl nest. Food overlap was low as kites preyed mainly on fish and owls on mammals. Eagle owls were absent from two study areas, bred very close to another area and were present at medium-high densities in the other five. Within-population effects varied and were most severe in areas with high owl densities. Overall, kites responded to predation risk through predator spatial avoidance, being concentrated in interstitial predation-refugia bordering the core home range of owl pairs. 2. Kite productivity declined steeply with increasing predation risk; no nestling fledged within 1 km of an owl nest. Brood predation was higher in an area with medium owl density than in an area lacking eagle owls. 3. The abandonment of kite territories increased near owl nests, but close coexistence was maintained by new kite territories being established occasionally in areas of high predation risk and high food abundance, which probably functioned as ecological traps. Compared to a random nest dispersion, colonial nesting was avoided within 1 km of an owl pair and peaked in conditions of medium predation risk. 4. At the population level, kite density and productivity were related to a complex interaction of IGP risk and food abundance, and were probably shaped by a mixture of top-down and bottom-up effects. These results may apply to many other vertebrate mesopredators, whose individual decisions and population responses are probably the result of a trade-off between predator avoidance and food acquisition. 5. At the community level, the density of different diurnal avian predators responded differently to IGP risk, some of them even increasing with this risk. The diversity of the assemblage peaked at medium-high eagle owl density. Future studies of top vertebrate predators need to take more account of IGP effects. Their conservation management needs to be highly case-specific and framed within a broader ecosystem perspective.},

	volume = {82},
	abstract = {We investigated the effects of interspecific competition on abundance, habitat partitioning, and coexistence of six closely related species of gobies (genus Gobiodon) that inhabit a range of coral species at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. After documenting the extent of overlap in habitat use among pairs of species in the field, we used a combination of field and laboratory experiments to investigate the relationship between these patterns and the occurrence of interspecific competition. Experiments in aquaria tested the ability of five of the species to compete against Gobiodon histrio, the apparent competitive dominant, including the effects of body size and prior residency. A manipulative field experiment, in which abundance of G. histrio was reduced, tested whether competition with this species limits the abundance of the other five species. Two species competed for space with G. histrio in the field, yet overlap in habitat use with G. histrio was high for one of these species (G. axillaris) and low for the other (G. brochus). In aquaria, G. axillaris and G. histrio preferred the same species of coral and had equivalent, size-based, competitive abilities. The coexistence of G. axillaris and G. histrio at the scale of tens of meters on the reef can thus be explained by a competitive lottery model. However, differential distributions of these two species across the reef flat and reef crest suggest that resource partitioning or habitat selection at larger spatial scales may also be important to their coexistence. In aquaria, G. brochus was an inferior competitor to G. histrio and could only gain access to the preferred species of coral through an advantage in body size or prior residency. Low overlap in habitat use between G. brochus and G. histrio in the field appears to result from niche shifts by the subordinate competitor only. The field experiment indicated that the other three species did not compete for space with G. histrio. Experiments in aquaria demonstrated that G. rivulatus and G. histrio exhibited low overlap in habitat use and did not compete, because they preferred different species of coral. In contrast. G. unicolor and G. histrio exhibited high overlap in habitat use but did not compete, because they were able to cohabit the same coral colonies without affecting each other. In aquaria, G. quinquestrigatus and G. histrio preferred the same coral species' however, in a field recolonization experiment, coral colonies previously occupied by G. quinquestrigatus were rarely recolonized by G. histrio, indicating that these species coexist because they use different types of coral colonies in the field. The study demonstrates that there is no single relationship between overlap in resource use and the occurrence of interspecific competition and that species within a guild can coexist by a diversity of mechanisms.},

The standard method for a predator-prey-resource chain estimates the effects of the prey's defensive behavior by comparing population densities or fitness measures in a "predator cue" treatment to those in a no-predator treatment. This design has been interpreted as providing a measure of the "nonconsumptive effect" of the predator on the prey and the "trait-mediated indirect effect" of the predator on the resource. Other approaches involve measurements of the impact of the behavior in the presence of functional predators. The questions addressed here are: (1) How consistent are the results of different approaches? (2) How time-dependent are their results? (3) How well do they correspond to theoretical measures of effect size? (4) How useful are the measurements in understanding system dynamics? A model of a tritrophic system in which the prey species adjusts a defensive trait adaptively is used to evaluate the experimental designs. Measures of changes in prey fitness or population density in a cue treatment generally include offsetting effects of the cost of the behavior and the benefit of more resources. This means that the sign of the effect, as well as its magnitude, may change depending on when the experiment is terminated. Because predation is not present in the cue treatment, few conclusions can be drawn about the impact of the behavior on population densities or fitness of the prey in a natural setting with predators. Cue experiments often do not accurately separate trait-mediated from density-mediated effects on the resource. Most scalar measures of effects are sensitive to experimental duration and initial densities. Use of a wider range of experimental designs to measure trait-related effects is called for.},

	volume = {78},
	abstract = {Much recent research has focused on the use of species distribution models to explore the influence(s) of environment (predominantly climate) on species' distributions. A weakness of this approach is that it typically does not consider effects of biotic interactions, including competition, on species' distributions. Here we identify and quantify the contribution of environmental factors relative to biotic factors (interspecific competition) to the distribution and abundance of three large, wide-ranging herbivores, the antilopine wallaroo (Macropus antilopinus), common wallaroo (Macropus robustus) and eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), across an extensive zone of sympatry in tropical northern Australia. To assess the importance of competition relative to habitat features, we constructed models of abundance for each species incorporating habitat only and habitat + the abundance of the other species, and compared their respective likelihoods using Akaike's information criterion. We further assessed the importance of variables predicting abundance across models for each species. The best-supported models of antilopine wallaroo and eastern grey kangaroo abundance included both habitat and the abundance of the other species, providing evidence of interspecific competition. Contrastingly, models of common wallaroo abundance were largely influenced by climate and not the abundance of other species. The abundance of antilopine wallaroos was most influenced by water availability, eastern grey kangaroo abundance and the frequency of late season fires. The abundance of eastern grey kangaroos was most influenced by aspects of climate, antilopine wallaroo abundance and a measure of cattle abundance. Our study demonstrates that where census and habitat data are available, it is possible to reveal species' interactions (and measure their relative strength and direction) between large, mobile and/or widely-distributed species for which competition is difficult to demonstrate experimentally. This allows discrimination of the influences of environmental factors and species interactions on species' distributions, and should therefore improve the predictive power of species distribution models.},

Few wildlife biologists, however, have incorporated intra- and interspecific interactions (e.g., conspecific attraction, competition, predator-prey relationships) to increase predictive accuracy of habitat models. Based on our literature review and preliminary data analysis, conspecific attraction can be a primary factor influencing habitat selection in wildlife. Conspecific attraction can lead to clustered distributions of wildlife within available habitat, reducing the predictive ability of habitat models based on vegetative and geographic parameters alone. We suggest wildlife biologists consider incorporating a parameter in habitat models for the clustered distribution of individuals within available habitat and investigate the mechanisms leading to clustered distributions of species, especially conspecific attraction.},

	abstract = {A spatial model was developed to predict the distribution of a marsh-nesting bird species, red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus L.) in Lake Erie coastal wetlands. The study site was in two diked wetland basins in Ottawa County, Ohio, USA. Geographic Information System (GIS) was used for data handling, storage, analyzing and running the model. Nests of birds were located, and vegetation durability, vegetation height, vegetation density, water depth, open water and structural aspects of the study basins were quantified by low altitude aerial photography and extensive field work for ground truthing. Spatial variables such as distance to open water edge, distance to wetlands edge, and friction maps by spread over depth and stem density for simulating predator access to wetlands were generated using the GIS. Model variables and coefficients were determined using logistic regression. Vegetation durability, distance to open water and depth of water significantly (P{\textless}0.01) affected the nesting outcome. Results show that the probability of a bird nesting in a location within a marsh increased with increasing vegetation durability, water depth, and with decreasing distance to open water edge. Model verification and validation indicated that the model did not show any interspecific interactions or clumping of nest sites defined by behavioral constraints. Results were in accordance with the conclusions of previous studies looking at breeding success of red-winged blackbird. This study validated the processes affecting nest site selection of red-winged blackbirds with extensive data and statistical analyses. The methodology and versatile character of the GIS-based spatial model enables adaptations to any other marsh-nesting bird species and geographic area. Data needed for the model are relatively easy to obtain and the model provides micro-habitat scale results that can be used by wetland conservationists and managers. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The habitat models included single and multiple species artificial neural networks for red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) and marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris). Data for the study came from two diked wetland basins on southwestern Lake Erie, USA. The single species artificial neural network model performed better than the logistic regression model except in the presence of interspecific interaction with marsh wren. A multiple species habitat model was developed using data from one basin that included both nesting red-winged blackbirds and marsh wrens. The multiple species neural network model performed better than the logistic regression model in the presence of interspecific interaction and could simultaneously predict the nest locations of both species. Using neural interpretation diagrams, relevances, and sensitivity analyses, we determined the mechanisms of habitat selection in red-winged blackbirds and marsh wrens. Habitat selection in marsh-breeding bird species was a non-linear process that could not be sufficiently understood in terms of general linear models. The non-linear structure of the neural network model not only predicts habitat selection better, but with a critical evaluation through neural interpretation diagrams, relevances and sensitivity analyses can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of habitat selection. As predictive tools single species neural network models were too specific in cases where the system changed to include interacting species. In these cases linear models might be better predictors but not necessarily provide a better understanding. In the presence of two interacting species we suggest the use of a neural network model that is trained with a data set from a wetland where all the interacting species are present. In the absence of the interacting species the dynamics will change and habitat selection can be based on an entirely different set of rules and relationships. Therefore, the decision on which neural network model to use must be based on an in-depth understanding of the ecology of the system under study. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As rural landscapes experience increasing levels of residential development, the persistence of species that rely on them will depend on informed planning and management decisions. An understanding of habitat requirements is essential for setting priorities and developing landscape-level plans for the survival of these species. In many temperate rural landscapes, artificially created ponds may be the only wetlands available for aquatic reproduction by amphibians. The introduction of non-native fish into these ponds reduces survival and prohibits successful reproduction of many native pond-breeding amphibians. We surveyed 105 randomly selected wetlands in a primarily privately-owned, rural landscape in north Idaho, USA, for pond-breeding amphibian larvae in 2004 and 2005. We used an information theoretic multimodel inference and an algorithmic (random forests) approach to model habitat for each species based on local and landscape characteristics. We also used a mail survey to quantify how landowners value fish in their wetlands and their plans for future wetland development and fish stocking. Sixty-seven percent of pond owners reported that fishing in their pond was at least slightly important to them and 36\% of owners indicated that they were at least 50\% likely to add fish to their ponds in the next 5-10 years. Landscape change predictions for this area indicate that forests will become more open due to thinning; habitat models indicated that this is likely to be detrimental to long-toed salamanders and beneficial to Pacific treefrogs. Habitat models also indicate that Columbia spotted frog breeding sites consist of wetlands on flat ground with high solar insolation and that this species is sensitive to nearby development, indicating that as this landscape becomes further developed, this species may require habitat protection for persistence.

In this study we developed a model of the distribution of buzzard nests in part of Argyll, Scotland. The model was tested on a further study site. 2. Habitat was described in terms of vegetation cover, derived from satellite imagery, and topography, using a digital terrain model to classify altitude, slope, aspect and ruggedness. This data base was incorporated into a Geographical Information System. 3. Environmental data, in the form of areas and boundary lengths of vegetation types and landscape classifications, were extracted from the data base for circular areas of various radii from the centre of 500 m grid cells covering each study area. We also included counts of buildings and lengths of roadways. 4. Both logistic regression analysis and discriminant function analysis were used to produce classification models, which assigned each grid cell a probability that it contained a buzzard nesting area. The best predictive model was based on median altitude, total boundary length between all vegetation categories, the amount of moorland and the length of boundary between pre-thicket forestry and open ground. 5. This model successfully reclassified 96 . 88\% of grid cells in the areas from which it was developed and 82 . 35\% in a test area.

	abstract = {Fish communities in high-elevation, Rocky Mountain streams consist of only one or a few trout species, so these streams are ideal for quantifying how physical habitat manipulation influences population biology. Managers often alter habitat structure in hopes of increasing the number or size of fish in a population, but this practice has not been rigorously evaluated, and the mechanisms involved are not well understood. We measured fish abundance and habitat conditions in each half of 500-m study reaches in six streams for 2 yr before and 6 yr after installing 10 low log weirs in a randomly designated half (treatment section). Mean depth, pool volume, total cover, and the proportion of fine substrate particles in the stream bed increased in treatment sections within 1 to 2 years, whereas habitat in adjacent controls remained unchanged. Abundance and biomass of adult fish, but not juveniles, increased in treatments relative to controls in all streams. Recaptures of trout that were individually tagged and others that were batch marked revealed that immigration was primarily responsible for increased adult abundance and biomass, whereas no biologically significant differences occurred for recruitment, survival, or growth. Few ({\textless}5\%) immigrants to treatment sections came from adjacent controls, indicating that the increased adult abundance did not result simply from fish redistributing within the study reach, but was caused instead by immigration from beyond the reach boundaries. Immigration to control sections was frequent as well, leading us to conclude that fish movement was common, contrary to most literature on stream trout. We also detected a high degree of concordance in fish abundance fluctuations within and among streams, suggesting that regional factors influenced fish populations over large spatial scales. Our research shows that log weirs increase trout abundance, but only if other management activities assure that fish dispersal remains unimpeded within the drainage.},

	abstract = {The advent of GIS is initiating a rapid increase in the utilization of wildlife-habitat models as tools for species and habitat management. However, such models rarely include estimates of interspecific interactions among explanatory variables. We tested the importance of such variables by using the peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus, a medium-sized raptor frequently reported to be affected by heterospecifics, as a model species. In an Alpine population, compared to random locations, peregrines selected breeding sites farther from conspecifics, on taller cliffs', with higher availability of farmland and closer to raven Corvus corax nests. Within suitable habitat, peregrines selected sites near ravens and far from elevations associated with golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos nests. Productivity increased with cliff size, farmland availability (rich in the local main prey) and with proximity to ravens, suggesting that the observed choices were adaptive. Finally, at the regional level, peregrine density peaked at low elevation and was positively associated with raven density. The results suggested an active breeding association of peregrines with ravens, which may provide early-warning cues against predators and safe alternative nest-sites. They also confirmed the importance of including estimates of interspecific interactions among explanatory variables, which may: 1) make models more realistic; 2) increase their predictive power by lowering unexplained variance due to unmeasured factors; 3) provide unexpected results such as the cryptic, large-scale breeding association of our study; and 4) stimulate further hypothesis formulation and testing, ultimately leading to deeper ecological knowledge of the study system.},

	volume = {31},
	abstract = {Aim Habitat selection studies have mainly focused on behavioural choices of individuals or on the habitat-related regional distribution of a population, with little integration of the two approaches. This is despite the fact that traditional biogeography theory sees the geographical distribution of a species as the collective outcome of the adaptive habitat choices of individuals. Here, we integrate individual habitat choices with regional distribution through a bottom-up Geographical Information System (GIS)-based approach, by using a 9-year data set on a large avian predator, the eagle owl (Bubo bubo L.). We further examine the potential population level and biodiversity consequences of this approach. Location The study was conducted in the Trento Region (central-eastern Italian Alps) and in six other areas of the nearby Lombardia Region in the central Alps. Methods We used stepwise logistic regression to build a habitat suitability model discriminating between eagle owl territories and an equal number of random locations. The model was applied to the whole Trento region by means of a GIS so as to predict suitable habitat patches. The predicted regional distribution (presence-absence in 10-km grid quadrats) was then compared with the observed one. Furthermore, we compared estimates of biodiversity in quadrats with and without eagle owls, so as to test whether the presence of this top predator may signal macro-areas of high biodiversity. Results The logistic habitat suitability model showed that, compared with a random distribution, eagle owls selected low-elevation breeding sites with high availability of prey-rich habitats in their surroundings. Breeding performance increased with the availability of prey-rich habitats, confirming the adaptiveness of the detected habitat choices. We applied the habitat suitability model to the 6200 km(2) study region by means of a GIS and found a close fit between the observed and predicted regional distribution. Furthermore, population abundance was positively related to the availability of habitat defined as suitable by the above analyses. Finally, high biodiversity levels were associated with owl presence and with the amount of suitable owl habitat, demonstrating that modelling habitat suitability of a properly chosen indicator species may provide key conservation information at the wider ecosystem level. Main conclusions Our bottom-up modelling approach may increase the conservation-value of habitat selection models, by (1) predicting local and regional distribution, (2) estimating regional population size, (3) stimulating further hypothesis testing, (4) forecasting the population effects of future habitat loss and degradation and (5) aiding in the identification and prioritization of high-biodiversity areas.},

Homogenization is the outcome of three interacting processes: introductions of normative species, extirpation of native species, and habitat alterations that facilitate these two processes. A central aspect of the homogenization process is the ability of species to overcome natural biogeographic barriers either through intentional transport by humans or through colonization routes created by human activities. Habitat homogenization through reservoir construction contributes to biotic homogenization as local riverine faunas are replaced with cosmopolitan lentic species. The homogenization process has generally increased biodiversity in most freshwater faunas, as the establishment of new species has outpaced the extinction of native species. There are important exceptions, however, where the establishment of nonindigenous species has had devastating impacts on endemic species. The homogenization process appears Rely to continue, although it could be slowed through reductions in the rate of invasions and extirpations and by rehabilitating aquatic habitats so as to favor native species.},

However this 'old-style' method is being replaced rapidly by a 'new-style' system in which water is pumped into paddy fields via taps and drained into deep concrete-sided canals. Concern has been expressed that the changes may cause paddy fields to decline in value as foraging habitats for egrets and herons, Ardeidae, because their aquatic prey are unable to move easily into new-style fields. We tested this hypothesis by comparing numbers of Ardeidae and their prey in paired old-and new-style areas at six sites in central Japan from May to August 1995. Few grey herons Ardea cinerea, great egrets Egretta alba or little egrets E. garzetta were recorded at our sites and no differences were observed in their use of old- and new-style areas. In contrast cattle Bubulcus ibis and intermediate E. intermedia egrets were common but only the latter preferred old-style areas. With respect to prey animals, we found gr eater numbers and biomasses of frogs, crayfish Procambarus clarkii, leach Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, and other fish in old-style paddy fields, and in old-style ditches we found more frogs, tadpoles and fish, bur generally fewer crayfish. There were no differences in the numbers or biomass of terrestrial invertebrates between the two types of paddy field. Reason for these observations are discussed. We suggest other topics which require investigation in order that effective wildlife management strategies for rice fields may be formulated. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	volume = {19},
	abstract = {The natural wetlands of the Mediterranean have been reduced to 10-20\% of their original area over the past few centuries. However, the rice fields that have supplanted them in some regions may valuable habitats for waterbirds. We describe the use of rice fields by waders, gulls, terns, ducks and herons in Italy, Spain, France. Greece and Portugal where this cultivation is most prevalent in certain restricted areas. Rice field systems, including the irrigation canals, are used by a variety of waterbirds, primarily as feeding habitats, and to a lesser extent as breeding sites. The long duration of flooding allows waterbird use through winter in Spain and France: it is limited to spring in other regions. However, the heavy dependence of waterbirds on rice fields is hazardous, because rice cultivation is subject to suddenly changing agricultural practices. Threats include risk from pesticide contamination, changes in the management of rice cultures, the rapidly spreading practice of cultivating rice on dry fields, and from large-scale hydrological changes. We urge authorities to recognize the importance of rice fields for the conservation of Mediterranean waterbirds and propose that cultivation and bird conservation issues be addressed in a holistic fashion.},

	volume = {65},
	abstract = {Ecosystem fragmentation is one of the most damaging anthropogenic impacts to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. In this study, we analyzed population-level characteristics of a resilient top predator, the gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus), across a gradient of fragmentation in Bahamian tidal creeks. Analysis of hydrologic connectivity (the inverse of fragmentation) and site-specific population parameters revealed that varying degrees of connectivity translated into predictable characteristics in fish populations. Less-fragmented systems produced fast-growing snapper with high condition factors, whereas more fragmented tidal creeks yielded slow-growing snapper with low condition factors. Underlying reasons for growth rate differences likely originated from structural and functional shifts in tidal creek ecosystems following fragmentation. Such ecosystem-level shifts were reflected by low per-individual volumes of consumed prey, as well as increased parasite infestations. Results indicated that aquatic ecosystem fragmentation may affect long-term fitness and viability of resilient species capable of persisting in fragmented habitats. Our results from estuarine tidal creeks compare well with studies on fragmentation of freshwater streams by dams and suggest that population-level consequences following ecosystem fragmentation may be generalizable between seemingly disparate aquatic environments.},
